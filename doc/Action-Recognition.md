| **[Beyond Timesteps: A Novel Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation Mechanism for Spiking Neural Networks in 3D cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12791v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the similar characteristics between event-based visual data and point clouds, recent studies have emerged that treat event data as event clouds to learn based on point cloud analysis. Additionally, some works approach point clouds from the perspective of event vision, employing Spiking Neural Network (SNN) due to their asynchronous nature. However, these contributions are often domain-specific, making it difficult to extend their applicability to other intersecting fields. Moreover, while SNN-based visual tasks have seen significant growth, the conventional timestep-wise iterative activation strategy largely limits their real-world applications by large timesteps, resulting in significant delays and increased computational costs. Although some innovative methods achieve good performance with short timesteps (<10), few have fundamentally restructured the update strategy of spiking neurons to completely overcome the limitations of timesteps. In response to these concerns, we propose a novel and general activation strategy for spiking neurons called Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2). This approach extends the concept of timesteps from a manually crafted parameter within the activation function to any existing network structure. In experiments on common point cloud tasks (classification, object, and scene segmentation) and event cloud tasks (action recognition), we found that AMP2 stabilizes SNN training, maintains competitive performance, and reduces latency compared to the traditional timestep-wise activation paradigm.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Prototype Model for Attribute-based Multi-label Few-shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12582v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world action recognition systems, incorporating more attributes helps achieve a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior. However, using a single model to simultaneously recognize multiple attributes can lead to a decrease in accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel method i.e. Adaptive Attribute Prototype Model (AAPM) for human action recognition, which captures rich action-relevant attribute information and strikes a balance between accuracy and robustness. Firstly, we introduce the Text-Constrain Module (TCM) to incorporate textual information from potential labels, and constrain the construction of different attributes prototype representations. In addition, we explore the Attribute Assignment Method (AAM) to address the issue of training bias and increase robustness during the training process.Furthermore, we construct a new video dataset with attribute-based multi-label called Multi-Kinetics for evaluation, which contains various attribute labels (e.g. action, scene, object, etc.) related to human behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AAPM achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both attribute-based multi-label few-shot action recognition and single-label few-shot action recognition.

| **[Advances in Multimodal Adaptation and Generalization: From Traditional Approaches to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18592v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions.

| **[Evolving Skeletons: Motion Dynamics in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02593v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention for its ability to efficiently represent spatiotemporal information in a lightweight format. Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton sequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around human physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework. Alternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture higher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex joint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces motion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a fresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action recognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both traditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN and Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal graph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against motion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of Taylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion dynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This study underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to effectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference (WWW Companion 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Do Language Models Understand Time?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13845v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.

| **[TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02483v5)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeletal sequence data, as a widely employed representation of human actions, are crucial in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Recently, adversarial attacks have been proposed in this area, which exposes potential security concerns, and more importantly provides a good tool for model robustness test. Within this research, transfer-based attack is an important tool as it mimics the real-world scenario where an attacker has no knowledge of the target model, but is under-explored in Skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR). Consequently, existing S-HAR attacks exhibit weak adversarial transferability and the reason remains largely unknown. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon via the characterization of the loss function. We find that one prominent indicator of poor transferability is the low smoothness of the loss function. Led by this observation, we improve the transferability by properly smoothening the loss when computing the adversarial examples. This leads to the first Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothened model posterior of pre-trained surrogates, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike existing transfer-based methods which overlook the temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. For exhaustive evaluation, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense models. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the https://github.com/yunfengdiao/Skeleton-Robustness-Benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/yunfengdiao/Skeleton-Robustness-Benchmark) |
| **[Enhancing Video Understanding: Deep Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07277v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It's no secret that video has become the primary way we share information online. That's why there's been a surge in demand for algorithms that can analyze and understand video content. It's a trend going to continue as video continues to dominate the digital landscape. These algorithms will extract and classify related features from the video and will use them to describe the events and objects in the video. Deep neural networks have displayed encouraging outcomes in the realm of feature extraction and video description. This paper will explore the spatiotemporal features found in videos and recent advancements in deep neural networks in video understanding. We will review some of the main trends in video understanding models and their structural design, the main problems, and some offered solutions in this topic. We will also review and compare significant video understanding and action recognition datasets.</p></details> | 29 pages, 25 figures | None |
| **[From Image to Video: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07001v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling, enabling unprecedented realism in image and video synthesis. This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Conformal Predictions for Human Action Recognition with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06631v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) frameworks are integral to many real-world computer vision systems, enabling human operators to make informed decisions with AI assistance. Conformal Predictions (CP), which provide label sets with rigorous guarantees on ground truth inclusion probabilities, have recently gained traction as a valuable tool in HITL settings. One key application area is video surveillance, closely associated with Human Action Recognition (HAR). This study explores the application of CP on top of state-of-the-art HAR methods that utilize extensively pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our findings reveal that CP can significantly reduce the average number of candidate classes without modifying the underlying VLM. However, these reductions often result in distributions with long tails. To address this, we introduce a method based on tuning the temperature parameter of the VLMs to minimize these tails without requiring additional calibration data.

| **[Kronecker Mask and Interpretive Prompts are Language-Action Video Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03549v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has significantly advanced image-based vision learning. A pressing topic subsequently arises: how can we effectively adapt CLIP to the video domain? Recent studies have focused on adjusting either the textual or visual branch of CLIP for action recognition. However, we argue that adaptations of both branches are crucial. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CLAVER}: a \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{A}ction \textbf{V}ideo Learn\textbf{er}, designed to shift CLIP's focus from the alignment of static visual objects and concrete nouns to the alignment of dynamic action behaviors and abstract verbs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Kronecker mask attention for temporal modeling. Our tailored Kronecker mask offers three benefits 1) it expands the temporal receptive field for each token, 2) it serves as an effective spatiotemporal heterogeneity inductive bias, mitigating the issue of spatiotemporal homogenization, and 3) it can be seamlessly plugged into transformer-based models. Regarding the textual branch, we leverage large language models to generate diverse, sentence-level and semantically rich interpretive prompts of actions, which shift the model's focus towards the verb comprehension. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and learning scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generality of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Building a Multi-modal Spatiotemporal Expert for Zero-shot Action Recognition with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09895v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR) requires collaborative multi-modal spatiotemporal understanding. However, finetuning CLIP directly for ZSAR yields suboptimal performance, given its inherent constraints in capturing essential temporal dynamics from both vision and text perspectives, especially when encountering novel actions with fine-grained spatiotemporal discrepancies. In this work, we propose Spatiotemporal Dynamic Duo (STDD), a novel CLIP-based framework to comprehend multi-modal spatiotemporal dynamics synergistically. For the vision side, we propose an efficient Space-time Cross Attention, which captures spatiotemporal dynamics flexibly with simple yet effective operations applied before and after spatial attention, without adding additional parameters or increasing computational complexity. For the semantic side, we conduct spatiotemporal text augmentation by comprehensively constructing an Action Semantic Knowledge Graph (ASKG) to derive nuanced text prompts. The ASKG elaborates on static and dynamic concepts and their interrelations, based on the idea of decomposing actions into spatial appearances and temporal motions. During the training phase, the frame-level video representations are meticulously aligned with prompt-level nuanced text representations, which are concurrently regulated by the video representations from the frozen CLIP to enhance generalizability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on popular video benchmarks (i.e., Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51) under challenging ZSAR settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[HyLiFormer: Hyperbolic Linear Attention for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05869v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in skeleton-based human action recognition, yet their quadratic computational complexity remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. To mitigate this, linear attention mechanisms have been explored but struggle to capture the hierarchical structure of skeleton data. Meanwhile, the Poincar\'e model, as a typical hyperbolic geometry, offers a powerful framework for modeling hierarchical structures but lacks well-defined operations for existing mainstream linear attention. In this paper, we propose HyLiFormer, a novel hyperbolic linear attention Transformer tailored for skeleton-based action recognition. Our approach incorporates a Hyperbolic Transformation with Curvatures (HTC) module to map skeleton data into hyperbolic space and a Hyperbolic Linear Attention (HLA) module for efficient long-range dependency modeling. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that HyLiFormer significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving model accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficiency-critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

The competition aimed to recognize human actions using a diverse dataset of 20 action classes, collected from multi-modal sources. The proposed approach is built upon the \acl{TSM}, a technique aimed at efficiently capturing temporal dynamics in video data, incorporating multiple data input types. Our strategy included transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models, followed by meticulous fine-tuning on the challenge's specific dataset to optimize performance for the 20 action classes. We carefully selected a backbone network to balance computational efficiency and recognition accuracy and further refined the model using an ensemble technique that integrates outputs from different modalities. This ensemble approach proved crucial in boosting the overall performance.

Importantly, all annotations are grounded in 3D through digital twinning of the scene, fixtures, object locations, and primed with gaze. Footage is collected from unscripted recordings in diverse home environments, making HDEPIC the first dataset collected in-the-wild but with detailed annotations matching those in controlled lab environments. We show the potential of our highly-detailed annotations through a challenging VQA benchmark of 26K questions assessing the capability to recognise recipes, ingredients, nutrition, fine-grained actions, 3D perception, object motion, and gaze direction. The powerful long-context Gemini Pro only achieves 38.5% on this benchmark, showcasing its difficulty and highlighting shortcomings in current VLMs. We additionally assess action recognition, sound recognition, and long-term video-object segmentation on HD-EPIC. HD-EPIC is 41 hours of video in 9 kitchens with digital twins of 413 kitchen fixtures, capturing 69 recipes, 59K fine-grained actions, 51K audio events, 20K object movements and 37K object masks lifted to 3D.

| **[MD-BERT: Action Recognition in Dark Videos via Dynamic Multi-Stream Fusion and Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03724v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition in dark, low-light (under-exposed) or noisy videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes MD-BERT, a novel multi-stream approach that integrates complementary pre-processing techniques such as gamma correction and histogram equalization alongside raw dark frames to address these challenges. We introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, extending existing attentional fusion methods to a three-stream setting, thereby capturing fine-grained and global contextual information across different brightness and contrast enhancements. The fused spatiotemporal features are then processed by a BERT-based temporal model, which leverages its bidirectional self-attention to effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships across frames. Extensive experiments on the ARID V1.0 and ARID V1.5 dark video datasets show that MD-BERT outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each input stream and the effectiveness of the proposed DFF and BERT modules.

| **[Identity-free Artificial Emotional Intelligence via Micro-Gesture Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13206v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on a special group of human body language -- the micro-gesture (MG), which differs from the range of ordinary illustrative gestures in that they are not intentional behaviors performed to convey information to others, but rather unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings. This characteristic introduces two novel challenges regarding micro-gestures that are worth rethinking. The first is whether strategies designed for other action recognition are entirely applicable to micro-gestures. The second is whether micro-gestures, as supplementary data, can provide additional insights for emotional understanding. In recognizing micro-gestures, we explored various augmentation strategies that take into account the subtle spatial and brief temporal characteristics of micro-gestures, often accompanied by repetitiveness, to determine more suitable augmentation methods. Considering the significance of temporal domain information for micro-gestures, we introduce a simple and efficient plug-and-play spatiotemporal balancing fusion method. We not only studied our method on the considered micro-gesture dataset but also conducted experiments on mainstream action datasets. The results show that our approach performs well in micro-gesture recognition and on other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous micro-gesture recognition methods. For emotional understanding based on micro-gestures, we construct complex emotional reasoning scenarios. Our evaluation, conducted with large language models, shows that micro-gestures play a significant and positive role in enhancing comprehensive emotional understanding. The scenarios we developed can be extended to other micro-gesture-based tasks such as deception detection and interviews. We confirm that our new insights contribute to advancing research in micro-gesture and emotional artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pr...</summary><p>We provide a link to the public release of the code and data in this new version</p></details> | None |
| **[SKI Models: Skeleton Induced Vision-Language Embeddings for Understanding Activities of Daily Living](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03459v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of vision-language models like CLIP has enabled the development of foundational video models capable of generalizing to unseen videos and human actions. However, these models are typically trained on web videos, which often fail to capture the challenges present in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) videos. Existing works address ADL-specific challenges, such as similar appearances, subtle motion patterns, and multiple viewpoints, by combining 3D skeletons and RGB videos. However, these approaches are not integrated with language, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen action classes. In this paper, we introduce SKI models, which integrate 3D skeletons into the vision-language embedding space. SKI models leverage a skeleton-language model, SkeletonCLIP, to infuse skeleton information into Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) through collaborative training. Notably, SKI models do not require skeleton data during inference, enhancing their robustness for real-world applications. The effectiveness of SKI models is validated on three popular ADL datasets for zero-shot action recognition and video caption generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HFGCN:Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11007v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, action recognition has received much attention and wide application due to its important role in video understanding. Most of the researches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance via various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton points. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was seldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to classify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point in terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological relations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation classification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To synthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a novel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the proposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different body parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the recognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the categorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the hypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order relationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation of the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and hypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and channel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ALBAR: Adversarial Learning approach to mitigate Biases in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00156v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in machine learning models can lead to unfair decision making, and while it has been well-studied in the image and text domains, it remains underexplored in action recognition. Action recognition models often suffer from background bias (i.e., inferring actions based on background cues) and foreground bias (i.e., relying on subject appearance), which can be detrimental to real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles or assisted living monitoring. While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background bias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both biases. We propose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that mitigates foreground and background biases without requiring specialized knowledge of the bias attributes. Our framework applies an adversarial cross-entropy loss to the sampled static clip (where all the frames are the same) and aims to make its class probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy maximization loss. Additionally, we introduce a gradient penalty loss for regularization against the debiasing process. We evaluate our method on established background and foreground bias protocols, setting a new state-of-the-art and strongly improving combined debiasing performance by over 12% on HMDB51. Furthermore, we identify an issue of background leakage in the existing UCF101 protocol for bias evaluation which provides a shortcut to predict actions and does not provide an accurate measure of the debiasing capability of a model. We address this issue by proposing more fine-grained segmentation boundaries for the actor, where our method also outperforms existing approaches.

Specifically, our CSVR consists of three branches: a generative pose prediction branch, a discriminative context matching branch, and a video generating branch. Among them, the first one encodes dynamic motion feature by utilizing Conditional-GAN to predict the human poses of future frames, and the second branch extracts static context features by contrasting positive and negative video feature and I-frame feature pairs. The third branch is designed to generate both current and future video frames, for the purpose of collaboratively improving dynamic motion features and static context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple popular video datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

While transformer-based architectures have been the de facto in vision-language training, they face challenges like quadratic computational complexity, high GPU memory usage, and difficulty with long-term dependencies. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaVL, a novel model that leverages recent advancements in selective state space modality fusion to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and learn joint representations for vision and language data. MambaVL utilizes a shared state transition matrix across both modalities, allowing the model to capture information about actions from multiple perspectives within the scene. Furthermore, we propose a question-answering task that helps guide the model toward relevant cues. These questions provide critical information about actions, objects, and environmental context, leading to enhanced performance. As a result, MambaVL achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition on the Epic-Kitchens-100 dataset and outperforms baseline methods in action anticipation.</p></details> |  | None |

Skeleton data are typically transmitted to cloud servers for action recognition, with results returned to clients via Apps/APIs. However, the vulnerability of skeletal models against adversarial perturbations gradually reveals the unreliability of these systems. Existing black-box attacks all operate in a decision-based manner, resulting in numerous queries that hinder efficiency and feasibility in real-world applications. Moreover, all attacks off the shelf focus on only restricted perturbations, while ignoring model weaknesses when encountered with non-semantic perturbations. In this paper, we propose two query-effIcient Skeletal Adversarial AttaCks, ISAAC-K and ISAAC-N. As a black-box attack, ISAAC-K utilizes Grad-CAM in a surrogate model to extract key joints where minor sparse perturbations are then added to fool the classifier. To guarantee natural adversarial motions, we introduce constraints of both bone length and temporal consistency. ISAAC-K finds stronger adversarial examples on $\ell_\infty$ norm, which can encompass those on other norms. Exhaustive experiments substantiate that ISAAC-K can uplift the attack efficiency of the perturbations under 10 skeletal models. Additionally, as a byproduct, ISAAC-N fools the classifier by replacing skeletons unrelated to the action. We surprisingly find that skeletal models are vulnerable to large perturbations where the part-wise non-semantic joints are just replaced, leading to a query-free no-box attack without any prior knowledge. Based on that, four adaptive defenses are eventually proposed to improve the robustness of skeleton recognition models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures | None |

RASO leverages a novel weakly-supervised learning framework that generates tag-image-text pairs automatically from large-scale unannotated surgical lecture videos, significantly reducing the need for manual annotations. Our scalable data generation pipeline gatherers to 2,200 surgical procedures and produces 3.6 million tag annotations across 2,066 unique surgical tags. Our experiments show that RASO achieves improvements of 2.9 mAP, 4.5 mAP, 10.6 mAP, and 7.2 mAP on four standard surgical benchmarks respectively in zero-shot settings, and surpasses state-of-the-art models in supervised surgical action recognition tasks.

| **[Optimizing Human Pose Estimation Through Focused Human and Joint Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14439v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has given rise to a broad spectrum of novel and compelling applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, as well as surveillance. However, accurate video pose estimation remains an open challenge. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that existing methods learn motion clues from all pixels rather than focusing on the target human body, making them easily misled and disrupted by unimportant information such as background changes or movements of other people. Additionally, while the current Transformer-based pose estimation methods has demonstrated impressive performance with global modeling, they struggle with local context perception and precise positional identification. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose a bilayer Human-Keypoint Mask module that performs coarse-to-fine visual token refinement, which gradually zooms in on the target human body and keypoints while masking out unimportant figure regions. (2) We further introduce a novel deformable cross attention mechanism and a bidirectional separation strategy to adaptively aggregate spatial and temporal motion clues from constrained surrounding contexts. (3) We mathematically formulate the deformable cross attention, constraining that the model focuses solely on the regions centered at the target person body. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmark datasets. A remarkable highlight is that our method achieves an 84.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging wrist joint, which significantly outperforms the 81.5 mAP achieved by the current state-of-the-art method on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

While effective and adaptable, these models often require substantial computational resources, especially in scenarios with multiple views and multiple temporal sequences. Addressing this limitation, this paper introduces the MV-GMN model, a state-space model specifically designed to efficiently aggregate multi-modal data (RGB and skeleton), multi-view perspectives, and multi-temporal information for action recognition with reduced computational complexity. The MV-GMN model employs an innovative Multi-View Graph Mamba network comprising a series of MV-GMN blocks. Each block includes a proposed Bidirectional State Space Block and a GCN module. The Bidirectional State Space Block introduces four scanning strategies, including view-prioritized and time-prioritized approaches. The GCN module leverages rule-based and KNN-based methods to construct the graph network, effectively integrating features from different viewpoints and temporal instances. Demonstrating its efficacy, MV-GMN outperforms the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, achieving notable accuracies of 97.3\% and 96.7\% on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset in cross-subject and cross-view scenarios, respectively. MV-GMN also surpasses Transformer-based baselines while requiring only linear inference complexity, underscoring the model's ability to reduce computational load and enhance the scalability and applicability of multi-view action recognition technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

These patterns arise in sequential data, such as video frames, which are often essential to accurately distinguish actions that would be ambiguous in a single image. HAR has garnered considerable interest due to its broad applicability, ranging from robotics and surveillance systems to sports motion analysis, healthcare, and the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles. While several taxonomies have been proposed to categorize HAR approaches in surveys, they often overlook hybrid methodologies and fail to demonstrate how different models incorporate various architectures and modalities. In this comprehensive survey, we present the novel SMART-Vision taxonomy, which illustrates how innovations in deep learning for HAR complement one another, leading to hybrid approaches beyond traditional categories. Our survey provides a clear roadmap from foundational HAR works to current state-of-the-art systems, highlighting emerging research directions and addressing unresolved challenges in discussion sections for architectures within the HAR domain. We provide details of the research datasets that various approaches used to measure and compare goodness HAR approaches. We also explore the rapidly emerging field of Open-HAR systems, which challenges HAR systems by presenting samples from unknown, novel classes during test time.</p></details> |  | None |

Action recognition models need to represent the action itself, not the appearance. However, some fully-supervised works show that models often rely on static appearances, such as the background and objects, rather than human actions. This issue, known as static bias, has not been investigated for zero-shot. Although CLIP-based zero-shot models are now common, it remains unclear if they sufficiently focus on human actions, as CLIP primarily captures appearance features related to languages. In this paper, we investigate the influence of static bias in zero-shot action recognition with CLIP-based models. Our approach involves masking backgrounds, objects, and people differently during training and validation. Experiments with masking background show that models depend on background bias as their performance decreases for Kinetics400. However, for Mimetics, which has a weak background bias, masking the background leads to improved performance even if the background is masked during validation. Furthermore, masking both the background and objects in different colors improves performance for SSv2, which has a strong object bias. These results suggest that masking the background or objects during training prevents models from overly depending on static bias and makes them focus more on human action.</p></details> | In proc. of MMM2025 | None |

To address this we introduce BlanketGen2-Fit3D (BG2-Fit3D), an augmentation of Fit3D dataset that contains 1,217,312 frames with synthetic photo-realistic blankets. To generate it we used BlanketGen2, our new and improved version of our BlanketGen pipeline that simulates synthetic blankets using ground-truth Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) meshes and then renders them as transparent images that can be layered on top of the original frames. This dataset was used in combination with the original Fit3D to finetune the ViTPose-B HPE model, to evaluate synthetic blanket augmentation effectiveness. The trained models were further evaluated on a real-world blanket occluded in-bed HPE dataset (SLP dataset). Comparing architectures trained on only Fit3D with the ones trained with our synthetic blanket augmentation the later improved pose estimation performance on BG2-Fit3D, the synthetic blanket occluded dataset significantly to (0.977 Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), 0.149 Normalized Mean Error (NME)) with an absolute 4.4% PCK increase. Furthermore, the test results on SLP demonstrated the utility of synthetic data augmentation by improving performance by an absolute 2.3% PCK, on real-world images with the poses occluded by real blankets. These results show synthetic blanket augmentation has the potential to improve in-bed blanket occluded HPE from RGB images. The dataset as well as the code will be made available to the public.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

By observing humans performing multi-step tasks, one can build assistants that have situational awareness of actions and tasks being performed, enabling them to cater assistance based on this understanding. In this paper, we develop a Context-aware Instructional Task Assistant with Multi-modal Large Language Models (InsTALL) that leverages an online visual stream (e.g. a user's screen share or video recording) and responds in real-time to user queries related to the task at hand. To enable useful assistance, InsTALL 1) trains a multi-modal model on task videos and paired textual data, and 2) automatically extracts task graph from video data and leverages it at training and inference time. We show InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance across proposed sub-tasks considered for multimodal activity understanding -- task recognition (TR), action recognition (AR), next action prediction (AP), and plan prediction (PP) -- and outperforms existing baselines on two novel sub-tasks related to automatic error identification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DSTSA-GCN: Advancing Skeleton-Based Gesture Recognition with Semantic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Topology Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12086v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for skeleton-based action and gesture recognition, thanks to their ability to model spatial and temporal dependencies in skeleton data. However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> | None |

In light of this, data collected through monitoring can provide essential insights, and information for decision-making aimed at preserving global biodiversity. Despite the importance of such data, there is a notable scarcity of datasets featuring videos of birds, and none of the existing datasets offer detailed annotations of bird behaviors in video format. In response to this gap, our study introduces the first fine-grained video dataset specifically designed for bird behavior detection and species classification. This dataset addresses the need for comprehensive bird video datasets and provides detailed data on bird actions, facilitating the development of deep learning models to recognize these, similar to the advancements made in human action recognition. The proposed dataset comprises 178 videos recorded in Spanish wetlands, capturing 13 different bird species performing 7 distinct behavior classes. In addition, we also present baseline results using state of the art models on two tasks: bird behavior recognition and species classification.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods still struggle to recognise seen actions on unseen objects due to the limitations in representing object shape and movement using 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, the reliance on object templates at test time limits their generalisability to unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage superquadrics as an alternative 3D object representation to bounding boxes and demonstrate their effectiveness on both template-free object reconstruction and action recognition tasks. Moreover, as we find that pure appearance-based methods can outperform the unified methods, the potential benefits from 3D geometric information remain unclear. Therefore, we study the compositionality of actions by considering a more challenging task where the training combinations of verbs and nouns do not overlap with the testing split. We extend H2O and FPHA datasets with compositional splits and design a novel collaborative learning framework that can explicitly reason about the geometric relations between hands and the manipulated object. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-arts in (compositional) action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing skeleton-based methods focus more on the skeleton, ignoring the objects interacting with humans, resulting in poor performance in recognizing actions that involve object interactions. We propose a new action recognition framework introducing object nodes to supplement absent interactive object information. We also propose Spatial Temporal Variable Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-VGCN) to effectively model the Variable Graph (VG) containing object nodes. Specifically, in order to validate the role of interactive object information, by leveraging a simple self-training approach, we establish a new dataset, JXGC 24, and an extended dataset, NTU RGB+D+Object 60, including more than 2 million additional object nodes. At the same time, we designe the Variable Graph construction method to accommodate a variable number of nodes for graph structure. Additionally, we are the first to explore the overfitting issue introduced by incorporating additional object information, and we propose a VG-based data augmentation method to address this issue, called Random Node Attack. Finally, regarding the network structure, we introduce two fusion modules, CAF and WNPool, along with a novel Node Balance Loss, to enhance the comprehensive performance by effectively fusing and balancing skeleton and object node information. Our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. The accuracy of our method on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split is 96.7\%, and on cross-view split, it is 99.2\%.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate streamlined video analysis. Our tool aims to deliver tailored textual summaries of user-defined queries, offering a focused insight amidst extensive video datasets. Unlike conventional frameworks that offer generic summaries or limited action recognition, our method harnesses the power of GenAI to distil relevant information, enhancing analysis precision and efficiency. Employing YOLO-V8 for object detection and Gemini for comprehensive video and text analysis, our solution achieves heightened contextual accuracy. By combining YOLO with Gemini, our approach furnishes textual summaries extracted from extensive CCTV footage, enabling users to swiftly navigate and verify pertinent events without the need for exhaustive manual review.

| **[High-Performance Inference Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18710v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the significant achievements have been made in skeleton-based human action recognition with the emergence of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models used for this task focus on constructing more complex higher-order connections between joint nodes to describe skeleton information, which leads to complex inference processes and high computational costs. To address the slow inference speed caused by overly complex model structures, we introduce re-parameterization and over-parameterization techniques to GCNs and propose two novel high-performance inference GCNs, namely HPI-GCN-RP and HPI-GCN-OP. After the completion of model training, model parameters are fixed. HPI-GCN-RP adopts re-parameterization technique to transform high-performance training model into fast inference model through linear transformations, which achieves a higher inference speed with competitive model performance. HPI-GCN-OP further utilizes over-parameterization technique to achieve higher performance improvement by introducing additional inference parameters, albeit with slightly decreased inference speed. The experimental results on the two skeleton-based action recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our HPI-GCN-OP achieves performance comparable to the current SOTA models, with inference speeds five times faster. Specifically, our HPI-GCN-OP achieves an accuracy of 93\% on the cross-subject split of the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset, and 90.1\% on the cross-subject benchmark of the NTU-RGB+D 120 dataset.

While recent developments, driven by powerful large language models (LLMs), aim to be general enough to cover a wide range of categories, they often overlook the need for more specific capabilities. In this work, we address the more challenging task of Fine-grained Action Recognition (FAR), which focuses on detailed semantic labels within shorter temporal duration (e.g., "salto backward tucked with 1 turn"). Given the high costs of annotating fine-grained labels and the substantial data needed for fine-tuning LLMs, we propose to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our framework, SeFAR, incorporates several innovative designs to tackle these challenges. Specifically, to capture sufficient visual details, we construct Dual-level temporal elements as more effective representations, based on which we design a new strong augmentation strategy for the Teacher-Student learning paradigm through involving moderate temporal perturbation. Furthermore, to handle the high uncertainty within the teacher model's predictions for FAR, we propose the Adaptive Regulation to stabilize the learning process. Experiments show that SeFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FAR datasets, FineGym and FineDiving, across various data scopes. It also outperforms other semi-supervised methods on two classical coarse-grained datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51. Further analysis and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our designs. Additionally, we show that the features extracted by our SeFAR could largely promote the ability of multimodal foundation models to understand fine-grained and domain-specific semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025; Code: https://github.com/KyleHuang9/SeFAR</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/KyleHuang9/SeFAR) |

These events provide rich motion cues that can be exploited for various computer vision tasks, such as action recognition. However, most existing DVS-based action recognition methods lose temporal information during data transformation or suffer from noise and outliers caused by sensor imperfections or environmental factors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that preserves and exploits the spatiotemporal structure of event data for action recognition. Our framework consists of two main components: 1) a point-wise event masked autoencoder (MAE) that learns a compact and discriminative representation of event patches by reconstructing them from masked raw event camera points data; 2) an improved event points patch generation algorithm that leverages an event data inlier model and point-wise data augmentation techniques to enhance the quality and diversity of event points patches. To the best of our knowledge, our approach introduces the pre-train method into event camera raw points data for the first time, and we propose a novel event points patch embedding to utilize transformer-based models on event cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> | None |

Unlike images, videos possess an additional temporal dimension, which harbors considerable redundant information, making condensation even more crucial. However, video dataset condensation still remains an underexplored area. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a large-scale empirical study with systematic design and fair comparison. Specifically, our work delves into three key aspects to provide valuable empirical insights: (1) temporal processing of video data, (2) establishing a comprehensive evaluation protocol for video dataset condensation, and (3) adaptation of condensation methods to the space-time domain and fair comparisons among them. From this study, we derive several intriguing observations: (i) sample diversity appears to be more crucial than temporal diversity for video dataset condensation, (ii) simple slide-window sampling proves to be effective, and (iii) sample selection currently outperforms dataset distillation in most cases.

Mainstream methods favor frame and voxel representations, which reach a satisfactory performance while introducing time-consuming transformation, bulky models, and sacrificing fine-grained temporal information. Alternatively, Point Cloud representation demonstrates promise in addressing the mentioned weaknesses, but it ignores the polarity information, and its models have limited proficiency in abstracting long-term events' features. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware network named FECNet that leverages Event Cloud representations. FECNet fully utilizes 2S-1T-1P Event Cloud by innovating the event-based Group and Sampling module. To accommodate the long sequence events from Event Cloud, FECNet embraces feature extraction in the frequency domain via the Fourier transform. This approach substantially extinguishes the explosion of Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) while effectively abstracting spatial-temporal features. We conducted extensive experiments on event-based object classification, action recognition, and human pose estimation tasks, and the results substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of FECNet.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

However, the complexity and high parameter count demands of these models hinder their practical applications, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose FreqMixForemrV2, which was built upon the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer) for identifying subtle and discriminative actions with pioneered frequency-domain analysis. We design a lightweight architecture that maintains robust performance while significantly reducing the model complexity. This is achieved through a redesigned frequency operator that optimizes high-frequency and low-frequency parameter adjustments, and a simplified frequency-aware attention module. These improvements result in a substantial reduction in model parameters, enabling efficient deployment with only a minimal sacrifice in accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations of standard datasets (NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a superior balance between efficiency and accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with only 60% of the parameters.</p></details> | IEEE FG2025 | None |
| **[CHASE: Learning Convex Hull Adaptive Shift for Skeleton-based Multi-Entity Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07153v2)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based multi-entity action recognition is a challenging task aiming to identify interactive actions or group activities involving multiple diverse entities. Existing models for individuals often fall short in this task due to the inherent distribution discrepancies among entity skeletons, leading to suboptimal backbone optimization. To this end, we introduce a Convex Hull Adaptive Shift based multi-Entity action recognition method (CHASE), which mitigates inter-entity distribution gaps and unbiases subsequent backbones. Specifically, CHASE comprises a learnable parameterized network and an auxiliary objective. The parameterized network achieves plausible, sample-adaptive repositioning of skeleton sequences through two key components. First, the Implicit Convex Hull Constrained Adaptive Shift ensures that the new origin of the coordinate system is within the skeleton convex hull. Second, the Coefficient Learning Block provides a lightweight parameterization of the mapping from skeleton sequences to their specific coefficients in convex combinations. Moreover, to guide the optimization of this network for discrepancy minimization, we propose the Mini-batch Pair-wise Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the additional objective. CHASE operates as a sample-adaptive normalization method to mitigate inter-entity distribution discrepancies, thereby reducing data bias and improving the subsequent classifier's multi-entity action recognition performance. Extensive experiments on six datasets, including NTU Mutual 11/26, H2O, Assembly101, Collective Activity and Volleyball, consistently verify our approach by seamlessly adapting to single-entity backbones and boosting their performance in multi-entity scenarios.

Specifically, most Asian scenarios are far more complex, involving numerous objects with distinct motions and behaviors. Addressing this gap, we present a new dataset, DAVE, designed for evaluating perception methods with high representation of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs: e.g. pedestrians, animals, motorbikes, and bicycles) in complex and unpredictable environments. DAVE is a manually annotated dataset encompassing 16 diverse actor categories (spanning animals, humans, vehicles, etc.) and 16 action types (complex and rare cases like cut-ins, zigzag movement, U-turn, etc.), which require high reasoning ability. DAVE densely annotates over 13 million bounding boxes (bboxes) actors with identification, and more than 1.6 million boxes are annotated with both actor identification and action/behavior details. The videos within DAVE are collected based on a broad spectrum of factors, such as weather conditions, the time of day, road scenarios, and traffic density. DAVE can benchmark video tasks like Tracking, Detection, Spatiotemporal Action Localization, Language-Visual Moment retrieval, and Multi-label Video Action Recognition. Given the critical importance of accurately identifying VRUs to prevent accidents and ensure road safety, in DAVE, vulnerable road users constitute 41.13% of instances, compared to 23.71% in Waymo. DAVE provides an invaluable resource for the development of more sensitive and accurate visual perception algorithms in the complex real world.

Current state-of-the-art methods tend to consider only the dependencies between connected skeletal joints, limiting their ability to capture non-linear dependencies between physically distant joints. Moreover, most existing approaches distinguish action classes by estimating the probability density of motion representations, yet the high-dimensional nature of human motions invokes inherent difficulties in accomplishing such measurements. In this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from two directions: (1) We propose a novel dependency refinement approach that explicitly models dependencies between any pair of joints, effectively transcending the limitations imposed by joint distance. (2) We further propose a framework that utilizes the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion to differentiate action classes without being affected by data dimensionality, and mathematically derive learning objectives guaranteeing precise recognition. Empirically, our approach sets the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Mutual Excitation for Hand-to-Hand and Human-to-Human Interaction Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02431v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing interactive actions, including hand-to-hand interaction and human-to-human interaction, has attracted increasing attention for various applications in the field of video analysis and human-robot interaction. Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition, which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC) layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph convolution operations. Extensive experiments on a challenging hand-to-hand interaction dataset, i.e., the Assembely101 dataset, and two large-scale human-to-human interaction datasets, i.e., NTU60-Interaction and NTU120-Interaction consistently verify the superiority of our proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based and Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize object and action recognition, often neglecting the intricate nuances of human emotions, behaviors, and speech visual alignment within video content. We present HumanVBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to bridge these gaps in the evaluation of video MLLMs. HumanVBench comprises 17 carefully designed tasks that explore two primary dimensions: inner emotion and outer manifestations, spanning static and dynamic, basic and complex, as well as single-modal and cross-modal aspects. With two advanced automated pipelines for video annotation and distractor-included QA generation, HumanVBench utilizes diverse state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques to streamline benchmark data synthesis and quality assessment, minimizing human annotation dependency tailored to human-centric multimodal attributes. A comprehensive evaluation across 16 SOTA video MLLMs reveals notable limitations in current performance, especially in cross-modal and temporal alignment, underscoring the necessity for further refinement toward achieving more human-like understanding. HumanVBench is open-sourced to facilitate future advancements and real-world applications in video MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 24 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

However, the high computational complexity of mainstream Transformer-based methods limits their application. Recent Mamba demonstrates efficiency in modeling long sequences, but directly applying Mamba to FSAR overlooks the importance of local feature modeling and alignment. Moreover, long sub-sequences within the same class accumulate intra-class variance, which adversely impacts FSAR performance. To solve these challenges, we propose a Matryoshka MAmba and CoNtrasTive LeArning framework (Manta). Firstly, the Matryoshka Mamba introduces multiple Inner Modules to enhance local feature representation, rather than directly modeling global features. An Outer Module captures dependencies of timeline between these local features for implicit temporal alignment. Secondly, a hybrid contrastive learning paradigm, combining both supervised and unsupervised methods, is designed to mitigate the negative effects of intra-class variance accumulation. The Matryoshka Mamba and the hybrid contrastive learning paradigm operate in two parallel branches within Manta, enhancing Mamba for FSAR of long sub-sequence. Manta achieves new state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks, including SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical studies prove that Manta significantly improves FSAR of long sub-sequence from multiple perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

It spurs the need to continually adapt to various users and scenes. Fine-tuning current video understanding models on newly encountered domains often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the models lose their ability to perform well on previously learned scenarios. To address this issue, we formalize the problem of Video Domain Incremental Learning (VDIL), which enables models to learn continually from different domains while maintaining a fixed set of action classes. Existing continual learning research primarily focuses on class-incremental learning, while the domain incremental learning has been largely overlooked in video understanding. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark of domain incremental human action recognition for unconstrained home environments. We design three domain split types (user, scene, hybrid) to systematically assess the challenges posed by domain shifts in real-world home settings. Furthermore, we propose a baseline learning strategy based on replay and reservoir sampling techniques without domain labels to handle scenarios with limited memory and task agnosticism. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our simple sampling and replay strategy outperforms most existing continual learning methods across the three proposed benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Still, their reliance on floating-point computations leads to high energy consumption, limiting their applicability in battery-powered devices. While energy-efficient, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) struggle to model skeleton dynamics, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose Signal-SGN (Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which utilizes the temporal dimension of skeleton sequences as the spike time steps and represents features as multi-dimensional discrete stochastic signals for temporal-frequency domain feature extraction. It combines the 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) module and the Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) module to extract features from the skeleton represented as spiking form. Additionally, the Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Feature Fusion (MWTF) module is proposed to extract dynamic spiking features and capture frequency-specific characteristics, enhancing classification performance. Experiments across three large-scale datasets reveal Signal-SGN exceeding state-of-the-art SNN-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency while attaining comparable performance with GCN methods and significantly reducing theoretical energy consumption.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods reliant on pose estimation or fancy sensor data often struggle to capture these dynamics accurately. We introduce FACTS, a novel transformer-based approach for fine-grained action recognition that processes raw video data directly, eliminating the need for pose estimation and the use of cumbersome body markers and sensors. FACTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 90% accuracy on fencing actions and 83.25% on boxing actions. Additionally, we present a new publicly available dataset featuring 8 detailed fencing actions, addressing critical gaps in sports analytics resources.

Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure, conference</p></details> | None |
| **[Synchronized and Fine-Grained Head for Skeleton-Based Ambiguous Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14833v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition using GCNs has achieved remarkable performance, but recognizing ambiguous actions, such as "waving" and "saluting", remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on a serial combination of GCNs and TCNs, where spatial and temporal features are extracted independently, leading to an unbalanced spatial-temporal information, which hinders accurate action recognition. Moreover, existing methods for ambiguous actions often overemphasize local details, resulting in the loss of crucial global context, which further complicates the task of differentiating ambiguous actions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play module called Synchronized and Fine-grained Head (SF-Head), inserted between GCN and TCN layers. SF-Head first conducts Synchronized Spatial-Temporal Extraction (SSTE) with a Feature Redundancy Loss (F-RL), ensuring a balanced interaction between the two types of features. It then performs Adaptive Cross-dimensional Feature Aggregation (AC-FA), with a Feature Consistency Loss (F-CL), which aligns the aggregated feature with their original spatial-temporal feature. This aggregation step effectively combines both global context and local details. Experimental results on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate significant improvements in distinguishing ambiguous actions.

However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (\textbf{PCAN}) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. \textbf{Firstly}, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. \textbf{Secondly}, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative ($\mathbb{FN}$) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive ($\mathbb{FP}$) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. \textbf{Finally}, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches.

Prevalent methods tackling this problem use differential privacy (DP) or obfuscation techniques to protect the privacy of individuals. In both cases, the utility of the trained model is sacrificed heavily in this process. In this work, we present an anonymization pipeline that replaces sensitive human subjects in video datasets with synthetic avatars within context, employing a combined rendering and stable diffusion-based strategy. Additionally we propose masked differential privacy ({MaskDP}) to protect non-anonymized but privacy sensitive background information. MaskDP allows for controlling sensitive regions where differential privacy is applied, in contrast to applying DP on the entire input. This combined methodology provides strong privacy protection while minimizing the usual performance penalty of privacy preserving methods. Experiments on multiple challenging action recognition datasets demonstrate that our proposed techniques result in better utility-privacy trade-offs compared to standard differentially private training in the especially demanding $\epsilon<1$ regime.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in real-world scenarios, human actions often fall outside the distribution of training data, requiring a model to both recognize in-distribution (ID) actions and reject out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Despite its importance, there has been limited research on OOD detection in human actions. Existing works on OOD detection mainly focus on image data with RGB structure, and many methods are post-hoc in nature. While these methods are convenient and computationally efficient, they often lack sufficient accuracy, fail to consider the exposure of OOD samples, and ignore the application in skeleton structure data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end skeleton-based model called Skeleton-OOD, which is committed to improving the effectiveness of OOD tasks while ensuring the accuracy of ID recognition. Through extensive experiments conducted on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-400 datasets, Skeleton-OOD demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of classic OOD detection techniques in the context of skeleton-based action recognition tasks, offering promising avenues for future research in this field.

In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.

Optical flow serves as a fundamental building block for various video-related tasks, such as video restoration, motion estimation, video stabilization, object tracking, action recognition, and video generation. While current state-of-the-art methods prioritize accuracy, they often overlook constraints regarding speed and memory usage. Existing light models typically focus on reducing size but still exhibit high latency, compromise significantly on quality, or are optimized for high-performance GPUs, resulting in sub-optimal performance on mobile devices. This study aims to develop a mobile-optimized optical flow model by proposing a novel mobile device-compatible architecture, as well as enhancements to the training pipeline, which optimize the model for reduced weight, low memory utilization, and increased speed while maintaining minimal error. Our approach demonstrates superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art lightweight models on the challenging KITTI and Sintel benchmarks. Furthermore, it attains a significantly accelerated inference speed, thereby yielding real-time operational efficiency on the iPhone 8, while surpassing real-time performance levels on more advanced mobile devices.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the prevailing methods are predominantly negative-based, necessitating additional momentum encoder and memory bank to get negative samples, which increases the difficulty of model training. Furthermore, these methods primarily concentrate on learning a global representation for recognition and retrieval tasks, while overlooking the rich and detailed local representations that are crucial for dense prediction tasks. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning framework based on feature decorrelation, called USDRL, which employs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains in a multi-grained manner to reduce redundancy among dimensions of the representations to maximize information extraction from features. Additionally, we design a Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE) to capture fine-grained action representations effectively, thereby enhancing the performance of dense prediction tasks. Comprehensive experiments, conducted on the benchmarks NTU-60, NTU-120, PKU-MMD I, and PKU-MMD II, across diverse downstream tasks including action recognition, action retrieval, and action detection, conclusively demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

The reliance on high-energy-consuming continuous floating-point operations inherent in GCN-based methods poses significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained, battery-powered edge devices. To address these limitations, MK-SGN, a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation, is proposed to leverage the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for skeleton-based action recognition for the first time. By integrating the energy-saving properties of SNNs with the graph representation capabilities of GCNs, MK-SGN achieves significant reductions in energy consumption while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy. Firstly, we formulate a Spiking Multimodal Fusion (SMF) module to effectively fuse multimodal skeleton data represented as spike-form features. Secondly, we propose the Self-Attention Spiking Graph Convolution (SA-SGC) module and the Spiking Temporal Convolution (STC) module, to capture spatial relationships and temporal dynamics of spike-form features. Finally, we propose an integrated knowledge distillation strategy to transfer information from the multimodal GCN to the SGN, incorporating both intermediate-layer distillation and soft-label distillation to enhance the performance of the SGN. MK-SGN exhibits substantial advantages, surpassing state-of-the-art GCN frameworks in energy efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art SNN frameworks in recognition accuracy. The proposed method achieves a remarkable reduction in energy consumption, exceeding 98\% compared to conventional GCN-based approaches.

While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only test for static spatial reasoning, such as categorizing the relative positions of objects. Meanwhile, real-world deployment requires dynamic capabilities like perspective-taking and egocentric action recognition. As a roadmap to improving spatial intelligence, we introduce SAT, Spatial Aptitude Training, which goes beyond static relative object position questions to the more dynamic tasks. SAT contains 218K question-answer pairs for 22K synthetic scenes across a training and testing set. Generated using a photo-realistic physics engine, our dataset can be arbitrarily scaled and easily extended to new actions, scenes, and 3D assets. We find that even MLMs that perform relatively well on static questions struggle to accurately answer dynamic spatial questions. Further, we show that SAT instruction-tuning data improves not only dynamic spatial reasoning on SAT, but also zero-shot performance on existing real-image spatial benchmarks: $23\%$ on CVBench, $8\%$ on the harder BLINK benchmark, and $18\%$ on VSR. When instruction-tuned on SAT, our 13B model matches larger proprietary MLMs like GPT4-V and Gemini-3-1.0 in spatial reasoning.

However, most of the applications deployed generate a lot of false alarms (violations) because they tend to generalize the requirements of PPE across the industry and tasks. The key to resolving this issue is to understand the action being performed by the worker and customize the inference for the specific PPE requirements of that action. In this paper, we propose a system that employs activity recognition models to first understand the action being performed and then use object detection techniques to check for violations. This leads to a 23% improvement in the F1-score compared to the PPE-based approach on our test dataset of 109 videos.</p></details> |  | None |

We envision a future service scenario where wireless sensing service providers distribute sensing models to users. During usage, users might request new sensing capabilities. For example, if someone is away from home on a business trip or vacation for an extended period, they may want a new sensing capability that can detect falls in elderly parents or grandparents and promptly alert them. In this paper, we propose CCS (continuous customized service), enabling model updates on users' local computing resources without data transmission to the service providers. To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in model updates where updating model parameters to implement new capabilities leads to the loss of existing capabilities we design knowledge distillation and weight alignment modules. These modules enable the sensing model to acquire new capabilities while retaining the existing ones. We conducted extensive experiments on the large-scale XRF55 dataset across Wi-Fi, millimeter-wave radar, and RFID modalities to simulate scenarios where four users sequentially introduced new customized demands. The results affirm that CCS excels in continuous model services across all the above wireless modalities, significantly outperforming existing approaches like OneFi.</p></details> | 9 pages,8 figures | None |

However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field is the accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion. Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lack of temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-based models benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations when faced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. This challenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond their training datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in the training data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-video based TempoRally contInuous Occlusion-Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novel Test-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video. This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered during the model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisy initial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during test time, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our framework demonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use any off-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporal consistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where it not only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimation models but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions, achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.

In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.</p></details> |  | None |

OAR must operate under stringent latency constraints, making it an indispensable component for real-time feedback for edge computing. Existing methods, which typically rely on the processing of entire video clips, fall short in scenarios requiring immediate recognition. To address this, we designed EdgeOAR, a novel framework specifically designed for OAR on edge devices. EdgeOAR includes the Early Exit-oriented Task-specific Feature Enhancement Module (TFEM), which comprises lightweight submodules to optimize features in both temporal and spatial dimensions. We design an iterative training method to enable TFEM learning features from the beginning of the video. Additionally, EdgeOAR includes an Inverse Information Entropy (IIE) and Modality Consistency (MC)-driven fusion module to fuse features and make better exit decisions. This design overcomes the two main challenges: robust modeling of spatio-temporal action representations with limited initial frames in online video streams and balancing accuracy and efficiency on resource-constrained edge devices.

Our approach decomposes skeletal motion analysis into spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal streams, using channel partitioning to capture distinct movement characteristics efficiently. By implementing a structured, multi-directional scanning strategy within SSMs, our model captures local joint interactions and global motion patterns across multiple anatomical body parts. This anatomically-aware decomposition enhances the ability to identify subtle motion patterns critical in medical diagnosis, such as gait anomalies associated with neurological conditions. On public action recognition benchmarks, i.e., NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA, our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy improvements up to $3.2\%$ with lower computational complexity than previous leading transformer-based models. We also introduce a novel medical dataset for motion-based patient neurological disorder analysis to validate our method's potential in automated disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods often focus solely on spatial or temporal features, limiting their ability to comprehend complex human activities fully. Our proposed model integrates joint, motion, and temporal information through a multi-stream fusion architecture. Specifically, it comprises a jointstream for extracting skeleton features, a temporal stream for capturing dynamic temporal features, and an ARN-LSTM block that utilizes Time-Distributed Long Short-Term Memory (TD-LSTM) layers followed by an Attention Relation Network (ARN) to model temporal relations. The outputs from these streams are fused in a fully connected layer to provide the final action prediction. Evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets outperform the superior performance of our model, particularly in group activity recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages,6 figures,4 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[TAMT: Temporal-Aware Model Tuning for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19041v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Going beyond few-shot action recognition (FSAR), cross-domain FSAR (CDFSAR) has attracted recent research interests by solving the domain gap lying in source-to-target transfer learning. Existing CDFSAR methods mainly focus on joint training of source and target data to mitigate the side effect of domain gap. However, such kind of methods suffer from two limitations: First, pair-wise joint training requires retraining deep models in case of one source data and multiple target ones, which incurs heavy computation cost, especially for large source and small target data. Second, pre-trained models after joint training are adopted to target domain in a straightforward manner, hardly taking full potential of pre-trained models and then limiting recognition performance. To overcome above limitations, this paper proposes a simple yet effective baseline, namely Temporal-Aware Model Tuning (TAMT) for CDFSAR. Specifically, our TAMT involves a decoupled paradigm by performing pre-training on source data and fine-tuning target data, which avoids retraining for multiple target data with single source. To effectively and efficiently explore the potential of pre-trained models in transferring to target domain, our TAMT proposes a Hierarchical Temporal Tuning Network (HTTN), whose core involves local temporal-aware adapters (TAA) and a global temporal-aware moment tuning (GTMT). Particularly, TAA learns few parameters to recalibrate the intermediate features of frozen pre-trained models, enabling efficient adaptation to target domains. Furthermore, GTMT helps to generate powerful video representations, improving match performance on the target domain. Experiments on several widely used video benchmarks show our TAMT outperforms the recently proposed counterparts by 13%$\sim$31%, achieving new state-of-the-art CDFSAR results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Revealing Key Details to See Differences: A Novel Prototypical Perspective for Skeleton-based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18941v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In skeleton-based action recognition, a key challenge is distinguishing between actions with similar trajectories of joints due to the lack of image-level details in skeletal representations. Recognizing that the differentiation of similar actions relies on subtle motion details in specific body parts, we direct our approach to focus on the fine-grained motion of local skeleton components. To this end, we introduce ProtoGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based model that breaks down the dynamics of entire skeleton sequences into a combination of learnable prototypes representing core motion patterns of action units. By contrasting the reconstruction of prototypes, ProtoGCN can effectively identify and enhance the discriminative representation of similar actions. Without bells and whistles, ProtoGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, and FineGYM, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Current leading EAR solutions typically follow two regimes: project unconstructed event streams into dense constructed event frames and adopt powerful frame-specific networks, or employ lightweight point-specific networks to handle sparse unconstructed event points directly. However, such two regimes are blind to a fundamental issue: failing to accommodate the unique dense temporal and sparse spatial properties of asynchronous event data. In this article, we present a synergy-aware framework, i.e., EventCrab, that adeptly integrates the "lighter" frame-specific networks for dense event frames with the "heavier" point-specific networks for sparse event points, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a joint frame-text-point representation space to bridge distinct event frames and points. In specific, to better exploit the unique spatiotemporal relationships inherent in asynchronous event points, we devise two strategies for the "heavier" point-specific embedding: i) a Spiking-like Context Learner (SCL) that extracts contextualized event points from raw event streams. ii) an Event Point Encoder (EPE) that further explores event-point long spatiotemporal features in a Hilbert-scan way. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the significant performance of our proposed EventCrab, particularly gaining improvements of 5.17% on SeAct and 7.01% on HARDVS.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods concentrate on minimally invasive surgery (MIS), leaving surgical phase recognition for open surgery understudied. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the scarcity of publicly available open surgery video datasets for surgical phase recognition. To address this issue, we introduce a new egocentric open surgery video dataset for phase recognition, named EgoSurgery-Phase. This dataset comprises 15 hours of real open surgery videos spanning 9 distinct surgical phases all captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head. In addition to video, the EgoSurgery-Phase offers eye gaze. As far as we know, it is the first real open surgery video dataset for surgical phase recognition publicly available. Furthermore, inspired by the notable success of masked autoencoders (MAEs) in video understanding tasks (e.g., action recognition), we propose a gaze-guided masked autoencoder (GGMAE). Considering the regions where surgeons' gaze focuses are often critical for surgical phase recognition (e.g., surgical field), in our GGMAE, the gaze information acts as an empirical semantic richness prior to guiding the masking process, promoting better attention to semantically rich spatial regions. GGMAE significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art recognition method (6.4% in Jaccard) and the masked autoencoder-based method (3.1% in Jaccard) on EgoSurgery-Phase. The dataset is released at https://github.com/Fujiry0/EgoSurgery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Fujiry0/EgoSurgery) |

Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures | None |

Traditional models using RGB and optical flow streams achieve strong performance but at a high computational cost. To address this, we introduce a representation flow algorithm to replace the optical flow branch in the egocentric action recognition model, enabling end-to-end training while reducing computational cost and prediction time. Our model, designed for egocentric action recognition, uses class activation maps (CAMs) to improve accuracy and ConvLSTM for spatio temporal encoding with spatial attention. When evaluated on the GTEA61, EGTEA GAZE+, and HMDB datasets, our model matches the accuracy of the original model on GTEA61 and exceeds it by 0.65% and 0.84% on EGTEA GAZE+ and HMDB, respectively. Prediction runtimes are significantly reduced to 0.1881s, 0.1503s, and 0.1459s, compared to the original model's 101.6795s, 25.3799s, and 203.9958s.

This approach resolves issues associated with real data such as collection and labeling costs, copyright and privacy. We extend this trend to the video domain applying it to the task of action recognition. Employing fractal geometry, we present methods to automatically produce large-scale datasets of short synthetic video clips, which can be utilized for pre-training neural models. The generated video clips are characterized by notable variety, stemmed by the innate ability of fractals to generate complex multi-scale structures. To narrow the domain gap, we further identify key properties of real videos and carefully emulate them during pre-training. Through thorough ablations, we determine the attributes that strengthen downstream results and offer general guidelines for pre-training with synthetic videos. The proposed approach is evaluated by fine-tuning pre-trained models on established action recognition datasets HMDB51 and UCF101 as well as four other video benchmarks related to group action recognition, fine-grained action recognition and dynamic scenes. Compared to standard Kinetics pre-training, our reported results come close and are even superior on a portion of downstream datasets.

Existing methods typically build the skeleton-semantics interactions by uncontrollable mappings and conspicuous representations, thereby can hardly capture the intricate and fine-grained relationship for effective cross-modal transferability. To address these issues, we propose a novel dyNamically Evolving dUal skeleton-semantic syneRgistic framework with the guidance of cOntext-aware side informatioN (dubbed Neuron), to explore more fine-grained cross-modal correspondence from micro to macro perspectives at both spatial and temporal levels, respectively. Concretely, 1) we first construct the spatial-temporal evolving micro-prototypes and integrate dynamic context-aware side information to capture the intricate and synergistic skeleton-semantic correlations step-by-step, progressively refining cross-model alignment; and 2) we introduce the spatial compression and temporal memory mechanisms to guide the growth of spatial-temporal micro-prototypes, enabling them to absorb structure-related spatial representations and regularity-dependent temporal patterns. Notably, such processes are analogous to the learning and growth of neurons, equipping the framework with the capacity to generalize to novel unseen action categories.

Many QMIX-based methods introduce monotonicity constraints between the joint action value and individual action values to achieve decentralized execution. However, such constraints limit the representation capacity of value factorization, restricting the joint action values it can represent and hindering the learning of the optimal policy. To address this challenge, we propose the Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighted QMIX (POWQMIX) algorithm, which recognizes the potentially optimal joint actions and assigns higher weights to the corresponding losses of these joint actions during training. We theoretically prove that with such a weighted training approach the optimal policy is guaranteed to be recovered.

We construct OccludeNet, a large-scale occluded video dataset that includes both real-world and synthetic occlusion scene videos under various natural environments. OccludeNet features dynamic tracking occlusion, static scene occlusion, and multi-view interactive occlusion, addressing existing gaps in data. Our analysis reveals that occlusion impacts action classes differently, with actions involving low scene relevance and partial body visibility experiencing greater accuracy degradation. To overcome the limitations of current occlusion-focused approaches, we propose a structural causal model for occluded scenes and introduce the Causal Action Recognition (CAR) framework, which employs backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning. This framework enhances key actor information, improving model robustness to occlusion. We anticipate that the challenges posed by OccludeNet will stimulate further exploration of causal relations in occlusion scenarios and encourage a reevaluation of class correlations, ultimately promoting sustainable performance improvements. The code and full dataset will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences.To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the motion on each joint in the pose at each time step extracted from 3D pose sequences, we hierarchically pool these joint motions in a bottom-up manner in the encoder, following the kinematic chains in the human body. We also constrain the latent embeddings of the encoder to contain the space of psychologically-motivated affective features underlying the gaits. We train the decoder to reconstruct the motions per joint per time step in a top-down manner from the latent embeddings. For the annotated data, we also train a classifier to map the latent embeddings to emotion labels. Our semi-supervised approach achieves a mean average precision of 0.84 on the Emotion-Gait benchmark dataset, which contains both labeled and unlabeled gaits collected from multiple sources. We outperform current state-of-art algorithms for both emotion recognition and action recognition from 3D gaits by 7%--23% on the absolute.

| **[When Spatial meets Temporal in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15284v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition has made significant strides, but challenges remain in effectively using both spatial and temporal information. While existing methods often focus on either spatial features (e.g., object appearance) or temporal dynamics (e.g., motion), they rarely address the need for a comprehensive integration of both. Capturing the rich temporal evolution of video frames, while preserving their spatial details, is crucial for improving accuracy. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Integration and Motion Enhancement (TIME) layer, a novel preprocessing technique designed to incorporate temporal information. The TIME layer generates new video frames by rearranging the original sequence, preserving temporal order while embedding $N^2$ temporally evolving frames into a single spatial grid of size $N \times N$. This transformation creates new frames that balance both spatial and temporal information, making them compatible with existing video models. When $N=1$, the layer captures rich spatial details, similar to existing methods. As $N$ increases ($N\geq2$), temporal information becomes more prominent, while the spatial information decreases to ensure compatibility with model inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TIME layer by integrating it into popular action recognition models, such as ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, and Video Masked Autoencoders, for both RGB and depth video data. Our experiments show that the TIME layer enhances recognition accuracy, offering valuable insights for video processing tasks.</p></details> | Research report | None |

In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site) |

However, the existing GCNs rely on the binary connection of two neighbouring vertices (joints) formed by an edge (bone), overlooking the potential of constructing multi-vertex convolution structures. In this paper we address this oversight and explore the merits of a hyper-graph convolutional network (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information conveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively optimises multi-scale hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven multi-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets, demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we outperform the existing solutions on NTU-120, achieving 90.2\% and 91.4\% in terms of the top-1 recognition accuracy on X-Sub and X-Set.</p></details> |  | None |

In the WSLR problem, a method designed for action recognition has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy. Indeed, it sounds reasonable for an action recognition method to perform well on WSLR because sign language is regarded as an action. However, a careful evaluation of the tasks reveals that the tasks of action recognition and WSLR are inherently different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel WSLR method that takes into account information specifically useful for the WSLR problem. We realize it as a multi-stream neural network (MSNN), which consist of three streams: 1) base stream, 2) local image stream, and 3) skeleton stream. Each stream is designed to handle different types of information. The base stream deals with quick and detailed movements of the hands and body, the local image stream focuses on handshapes and facial expressions, and the skeleton stream captures the relative positions of the body and both hands. This approach allows us to combine various types of data for more comprehensive gesture analysis. Experimental results on the WLASL and MS-ASL datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method; it achieved an improvement of approximately 10\%--15\% in Top-1 accuracy when compared with conventional methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most of these methods tend to construct complex topology learning mechanisms while neglecting the inherent symmetry of the human body. Additionally, the use of temporal convolutions with certain fixed receptive fields limits their capacity to effectively capture dependencies in time sequences. To address the issues, we (1) propose a novel Topological Symmetry Enhanced Graph Convolution (TSE-GC) to enable distinct topology learning across different channel partitions while incorporating topological symmetry awareness and (2) construct a Multi-Branch Deformable Temporal Convolution (MBDTC) for skeleton-based action recognition. The proposed TSE-GC emphasizes the inherent symmetry of the human body while enabling efficient learning of dynamic topologies. Meanwhile, the design of MBDTC introduces the concept of deformable modeling, leading to more flexible receptive fields and stronger modeling capacity of temporal dependencies. Combining TSE-GC with MBDTC, our final model, TSE-GCN, achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods on three large datasets, NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA. On the cross-subject and cross-set evaluations of NTU RGB+D 120, the accuracies of our model reach 90.0\% and 91.1\%, with 1.1M parameters and 1.38 GFLOPS for one stream.</p></details> |  | None |

Although a wide range of spatial and temporal alignment modules have been proposed, they primarily address spatial or temporal misalignments at the video level, while the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level remain underexplored. Recent studies utilize class prototypes to learn task-specific features but overlook the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level, especially in the spatial dimension, where these relationships provide rich information. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Motion-Guided Attention Learning method (called DMGAL) for few-shot action recognition, aiming to learn the spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific to the task-specific level. To achieve this, we propose a carefully designed Motion-Guided Attention (MGA) method to identify and correlate motion-related region features from the video level to the task level. Specifically, the Self Motion-Guided Attention module (S-MGA) achieves spatio-temporal relation modeling at the video level by identifying and correlating motion-related region features between different frames within a video. The Cross Motion-Guided Attention module (C-MGA) identifies and correlates motion-related region features between frames of different videos within a specific task to achieve spatio-temporal relationships at the task level. This approach enables the model to construct class prototypes that fully incorporate spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific level to the task-specific level. We validate the effectiveness of our DMGAL method by employing both fully fine-tuning and adapter-tuning paradigms. The models developed using these paradigms are termed DMGAL-FT and DMGAL-Adapter, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Within any single domain, actions can often appear quite similar, making it challenging for deep models to distinguish them accurately. To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal foundation models in helping us recognize such actions, we present ActionAtlas v1.0, a multiple-choice video question answering benchmark featuring short videos across various sports. Each video in the dataset is paired with a question and four or five choices. The question pinpoints specific individuals, asking which choice "best" describes their action within a certain temporal context. Overall, the dataset includes 934 videos showcasing 580 unique actions across 56 sports, with a total of 1896 actions within choices. Unlike most existing video question answering benchmarks that only cover simplistic actions, often identifiable from a single frame, ActionAtlas focuses on intricate movements and rigorously tests the model's capability to discern subtle differences between moves that look similar within each domain. We evaluate open and proprietary foundation models on this benchmark, finding that the best model, GPT-4o, achieves a maximum accuracy of 45.52%. Meanwhile, Non-expert crowd workers, provided with action description for each choice, achieve 61.64% accuracy, where random chance is approximately 21%. Our findings with state-of-the-art models indicate that having a high frame sampling rate is important for accurately recognizing actions in ActionAtlas, a feature that some leading proprietary video models, such as Gemini, do not include in their default configuration.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Video RWKV:Video Action Recognition Based RWKV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05636v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the challenges of high computational costs and long-distance dependencies in exist ing video understanding methods, such as CNNs and Transformers, this work introduces RWKV to the video domain in a novel way. We propose a LSTM CrossRWKV (LCR) framework, designed for spatiotemporal representation learning to tackle the video understanding task. Specifically, the proposed linear complexity LCR incorporates a novel Cross RWKV gate to facilitate interaction be tween current frame edge information and past features, enhancing the focus on the subject through edge features and globally aggregating inter-frame features over time. LCR stores long-term mem ory for video processing through an enhanced LSTM recurrent execution mechanism. By leveraging the Cross RWKV gate and recurrent execution, LCR effectively captures both spatial and temporal features. Additionally, the edge information serves as a forgetting gate for LSTM, guiding long-term memory management.Tube masking strategy reduces redundant information in food and reduces overfitting.These advantages enable LSTM CrossRWKV to set a new benchmark in video under standing, offering a scalable and efficient solution for comprehensive video analysis. All code and models are publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[C3T: Cross-modal Transfer Through Time for Human Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16803v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between modalities using the structure of a unified multimodal representation space for Human Action Recognition (HAR). We formalize and explore an understudied cross-modal transfer setting we term Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA), where the modality used in testing is not used in supervised training, i.e. zero labeled instances of the test modality are available during training. We develop three methods to perform UMA: Student-Teacher (ST), Contrastive Alignment (CA), and Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T). Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets compare these methods to each other in the UMA setting, and to their empirical upper bound in the supervised setting. The results indicate C3T is the most robust and highest performing by at least a margin of 8%, and nears the supervised setting performance even in the presence of temporal noise. This method introduces a novel mechanism for aligning signals across time-varying latent vectors, extracted from the receptive field of temporal convolutions. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for multi-modal learning in various applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explaining Human Activity Recognition with SHAP: Validating Insights with Perturbation and Quantitative Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03714v1)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Human Activity Recognition (HAR), understanding the intricacy of body movements within high-risk applications is essential. This study uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain the decision-making process of Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) when classifying activities with skeleton data. We employ SHAP to explain two real-world datasets: one for cerebral palsy (CP) classification and the widely used NTU RGB+D 60 action recognition dataset. To test the explanation, we introduce a novel perturbation approach that modifies the model's edge importance matrix, allowing us to evaluate the impact of specific body key points on prediction outcomes. To assess the fidelity of our explanations, we employ informed perturbation, targeting body key points identified as important by SHAP and comparing them against random perturbation as a control condition. This perturbation enables a judgment on whether the body key points are truly influential or non-influential based on the SHAP values. Results on both datasets show that body key points identified as important through SHAP have the largest influence on the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity metrics. Our findings highlight that SHAP can provide granular insights into the input feature contribution to the prediction outcome of GCNs in HAR tasks. This demonstrates the potential for more interpretable and trustworthy models in high-stakes applications like healthcare or rehabilitation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AM Flow: Adapters for Temporal Processing in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02065v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, in particular \textit{image} models, have recently gained generalisability and robustness. %are becoming more general and robust by the day. In this work, we propose to exploit such advances in the realm of \textit{video} classification. Video foundation models suffer from the requirement of extensive pretraining and a large training time. Towards mitigating such limitations, we propose "\textit{Attention Map (AM) Flow}" for image models, a method for identifying pixels relevant to motion in each input video frame. In this context, we propose two methods to compute AM flow, depending on camera motion. AM flow allows the separation of spatial and temporal processing, while providing improved results over combined spatio-temporal processing (as in video models). Adapters, one of the popular techniques in parameter efficient transfer learning, facilitate the incorporation of AM flow into pretrained image models, mitigating the need for full-finetuning. We extend adapters to "\textit{temporal processing adapters}" by incorporating a temporal processing unit into the adapters. Our work achieves faster convergence, therefore reducing the number of epochs needed for training. Moreover, we endow an image model with the ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on popular action recognition datasets. This reduces training time and simplifies pretraining. We present experiments on Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and Toyota Smarthome datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art or comparable results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Badminton Action Recognition with a New Fine-Grained Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12385v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the dynamic and evolving field of computer vision, action recognition has become a key focus, especially with the advent of sophisticated methodologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Convolutional 3D, Transformer, and spatial-temporal feature fusion. These technologies have shown promising results on well-established benchmarks but face unique challenges in real-world applications, particularly in sports analysis, where the precise decomposition of activities and the distinction of subtly different actions are crucial. Existing datasets like UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics have offered a diverse range of video data for various scenarios. However, there's an increasing need for fine-grained video datasets that capture detailed categorizations and nuances within broader action categories. In this paper, we introduce the VideoBadminton dataset derived from high-quality badminton footage. Through an exhaustive evaluation of leading methodologies on this dataset, this study aims to advance the field of action recognition, particularly in badminton sports. The introduction of VideoBadminton could not only serve for badminton action recognition but also provide a dataset for recognizing fine-grained actions. The insights gained from these evaluations are expected to catalyze further research in action comprehension, especially within sports contexts.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HENASY: Learning to Assemble Scene-Entities for Egocentric Video-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00307v4)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video-language models (VLMs) rely extensively on instance-level alignment between video and language modalities, which presents two major limitations: (1) visual reasoning disobeys the natural perception that humans do in first-person perspective, leading to a lack of reasoning interpretation; and (2) learning is limited in capturing inherent fine-grained relationships between two modalities. In this paper, we take an inspiration from human perception and explore a compositional approach for egocentric video representation. We introduce HENASY (Hierarchical ENtities ASsemblY), which includes a spatiotemporal token grouping mechanism to explicitly assemble dynamically evolving scene entities through time and model their relationship for video representation. By leveraging compositional structure understanding, HENASY possesses strong interpretability via visual grounding with free-form text queries. We further explore a suite of multi-grained contrastive losses to facilitate entity-centric understandings. This comprises three alignment types: video-narration, noun-entity, verb-entities alignments. Our method demonstrates strong interpretability in both quantitative and qualitative experiments; while maintaining competitive performances on five downstream tasks via zero-shot transfer or as video/text representation, including video/text retrieval, action recognition, multi-choice query, natural language query, and moments query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[STAA: Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution for Real-Time Interpreting Transformer-based Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00630v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, including image and video analysis. However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Recovering Complete Actions for Cross-dataset Skeleton Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23641v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite huge progress in skeleton-based action recognition, its generalizability to different domains remains a challenging issue. In this paper, to solve the skeleton action generalization problem, we present a recover-and-resample augmentation framework based on a novel complete action prior. We observe that human daily actions are confronted with temporal mismatch across different datasets, as they are usually partial observations of their complete action sequences. By recovering complete actions and resampling from these full sequences, we can generate strong augmentations for unseen domains. At the same time, we discover the nature of general action completeness within large datasets, indicated by the per-frame diversity over time. This allows us to exploit two assets of transferable knowledge that can be shared across action samples and be helpful for action completion: boundary poses for determining the action start, and linear temporal transforms for capturing global action patterns. Therefore, we formulate the recovering stage as a two-step stochastic action completion with boundary pose-conditioned extrapolation followed by smooth linear transforms. Both the boundary poses and linear transforms can be efficiently learned from the whole dataset via clustering. We validate our approach on a cross-dataset setting with three skeleton action datasets, outperforming other domain generalization approaches by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

In the game, participants assume dual roles, i.e., requesters, who issue social requests, and performers, who respond social requests through performing specified body languages. To mediate the communication between participants, we build an AI-enhanced video analysis system incorporating multiple visual analysis modules like person detection, attribute recognition, and action recognition, to assess the performer's body language quality. A two-week field study involving 27 participants shows significant improvements in their social friendships, as indicated by self-reported questionnaires. Moreover, user experiences are investigated to highlight the potential of public video cameras as a novel communication medium for socializing in public spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as a main track paper by EAI-ArtsIT 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[A Simple and Effective Temporal Grounding Pipeline for Basketball Broadcast Footage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00862v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a reliable temporal grounding pipeline for video-to-analytic alignment of basketball broadcast footage. Given a series of frames as input, our method quickly and accurately extracts time-remaining and quarter values from basketball broadcast scenes. Our work intends to expedite the development of large, multi-modal video datasets to train data-hungry video models in the sports action recognition domain. Our method aligns a pre-labeled corpus of play-by-play annotations containing dense event annotations to video frames, enabling quick retrieval of labeled video segments. Unlike previous methods, we forgo the need to localize game clocks by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box object detector to find semantic text regions directly. Our end-to-end approach improves the generality of our work. Additionally, interpolation and parallelization techniques prepare our pipeline for deployment in a large computing cluster.
