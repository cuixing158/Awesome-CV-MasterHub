| **[TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02483v5)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeletal sequence data, as a widely employed representation of human actions, are crucial in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Recently, adversarial attacks have been proposed in this area, which exposes potential security concerns, and more importantly provides a good tool for model robustness test. Within this research, transfer-based attack is an important tool as it mimics the real-world scenario where an attacker has no knowledge of the target model, but is under-explored in Skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR). Consequently, existing S-HAR attacks exhibit weak adversarial transferability and the reason remains largely unknown. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon via the characterization of the loss function. We find that one prominent indicator of poor transferability is the low smoothness of the loss function. Led by this observation, we improve the transferability by properly smoothening the loss when computing the adversarial examples. This leads to the first Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothened model posterior of pre-trained surrogates, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike existing transfer-based methods which overlook the temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. For exhaustive evaluation, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense models. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the https://github.com/yunfengdiao/Skeleton-Robustness-Benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Video Understanding: Deep Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07277v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It's no secret that video has become the primary way we share information online. That's why there's been a surge in demand for algorithms that can analyze and understand video content. It's a trend going to continue as video continues to dominate the digital landscape. These algorithms will extract and classify related features from the video and will use them to describe the events and objects in the video. Deep neural networks have displayed encouraging outcomes in the realm of feature extraction and video description. This paper will explore the spatiotemporal features found in videos and recent advancements in deep neural networks in video understanding. We will review some of the main trends in video understanding models and their structural design, the main problems, and some offered solutions in this topic. We will also review and compare significant video understanding and action recognition datasets.</p></details> | 29 pages, 25 figures | None |
| **[From Image to Video: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07001v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling, enabling unprecedented realism in image and video synthesis. This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Conformal Predictions for Human Action Recognition with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06631v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) frameworks are integral to many real-world computer vision systems, enabling human operators to make informed decisions with AI assistance. Conformal Predictions (CP), which provide label sets with rigorous guarantees on ground truth inclusion probabilities, have recently gained traction as a valuable tool in HITL settings. One key application area is video surveillance, closely associated with Human Action Recognition (HAR). This study explores the application of CP on top of state-of-the-art HAR methods that utilize extensively pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our findings reveal that CP can significantly reduce the average number of candidate classes without modifying the underlying VLM. However, these reductions often result in distributions with long tails. To address this, we introduce a method based on tuning the temperature parameter of the VLMs to minimize these tails without requiring additional calibration data. Our code is made available on GitHub at the address https://github.com/tbary/CP4VLM.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Kronecker Mask and Interpretive Prompts are Language-Action Video Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03549v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has significantly advanced image-based vision learning. A pressing topic subsequently arises: how can we effectively adapt CLIP to the video domain? Recent studies have focused on adjusting either the textual or visual branch of CLIP for action recognition. However, we argue that adaptations of both branches are crucial. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CLAVER}: a \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{A}ction \textbf{V}ideo Learn\textbf{er}, designed to shift CLIP's focus from the alignment of static visual objects and concrete nouns to the alignment of dynamic action behaviors and abstract verbs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Kronecker mask attention for temporal modeling. Our tailored Kronecker mask offers three benefits 1) it expands the temporal receptive field for each token, 2) it serves as an effective spatiotemporal heterogeneity inductive bias, mitigating the issue of spatiotemporal homogenization, and 3) it can be seamlessly plugged into transformer-based models. Regarding the textual branch, we leverage large language models to generate diverse, sentence-level and semantically rich interpretive prompts of actions, which shift the model's focus towards the verb comprehension. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and learning scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generality of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Building a Multi-modal Spatiotemporal Expert for Zero-shot Action Recognition with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09895v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR) requires collaborative multi-modal spatiotemporal understanding. However, finetuning CLIP directly for ZSAR yields suboptimal performance, given its inherent constraints in capturing essential temporal dynamics from both vision and text perspectives, especially when encountering novel actions with fine-grained spatiotemporal discrepancies. In this work, we propose Spatiotemporal Dynamic Duo (STDD), a novel CLIP-based framework to comprehend multi-modal spatiotemporal dynamics synergistically. For the vision side, we propose an efficient Space-time Cross Attention, which captures spatiotemporal dynamics flexibly with simple yet effective operations applied before and after spatial attention, without adding additional parameters or increasing computational complexity. For the semantic side, we conduct spatiotemporal text augmentation by comprehensively constructing an Action Semantic Knowledge Graph (ASKG) to derive nuanced text prompts. The ASKG elaborates on static and dynamic concepts and their interrelations, based on the idea of decomposing actions into spatial appearances and temporal motions. During the training phase, the frame-level video representations are meticulously aligned with prompt-level nuanced text representations, which are concurrently regulated by the video representations from the frozen CLIP to enhance generalizability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on popular video benchmarks (i.e., Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51) under challenging ZSAR settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[HyLiFormer: Hyperbolic Linear Attention for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05869v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in skeleton-based human action recognition, yet their quadratic computational complexity remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. To mitigate this, linear attention mechanisms have been explored but struggle to capture the hierarchical structure of skeleton data. Meanwhile, the Poincar\'e model, as a typical hyperbolic geometry, offers a powerful framework for modeling hierarchical structures but lacks well-defined operations for existing mainstream linear attention. In this paper, we propose HyLiFormer, a novel hyperbolic linear attention Transformer tailored for skeleton-based action recognition. Our approach incorporates a Hyperbolic Transformation with Curvatures (HTC) module to map skeleton data into hyperbolic space and a Hyperbolic Linear Attention (HLA) module for efficient long-range dependency modeling. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that HyLiFormer significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving model accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficiency-critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Action Recognition Using Temporal Shift Module and Ensemble Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17550v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first-rank solution for the Multi-Modal Action Recognition Challenge, part of the Multi-Modal Visual Pattern Recognition Workshop at the \acl{ICPR} 2024. The competition aimed to recognize human actions using a diverse dataset of 20 action classes, collected from multi-modal sources. The proposed approach is built upon the \acl{TSM}, a technique aimed at efficiently capturing temporal dynamics in video data, incorporating multiple data input types. Our strategy included transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models, followed by meticulous fine-tuning on the challenge's specific dataset to optimize performance for the 20 action classes. We carefully selected a backbone network to balance computational efficiency and recognition accuracy and further refined the model using an ensemble technique that integrates outputs from different modalities. This ensemble approach proved crucial in boosting the overall performance. Our solution achieved a perfect top-1 accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in recognizing human actions across 20 classes.

| **[HD-EPIC: A Highly-Detailed Egocentric Video Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04144v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a validation dataset of newly-collected kitchen-based egocentric videos, manually annotated with highly detailed and interconnected ground-truth labels covering: recipe steps, fine-grained actions, ingredients with nutritional values, moving objects, and audio annotations. Importantly, all annotations are grounded in 3D through digital twinning of the scene, fixtures, object locations, and primed with gaze. Footage is collected from unscripted recordings in diverse home environments, making HDEPIC the first dataset collected in-the-wild but with detailed annotations matching those in controlled lab environments. We show the potential of our highly-detailed annotations through a challenging VQA benchmark of 26K questions assessing the capability to recognise recipes, ingredients, nutrition, fine-grained actions, 3D perception, object motion, and gaze direction. The powerful long-context Gemini Pro only achieves 38.5% on this benchmark, showcasing its difficulty and highlighting shortcomings in current VLMs. We additionally assess action recognition, sound recognition, and long-term video-object segmentation on HD-EPIC. HD-EPIC is 41 hours of video in 9 kitchens with digital twins of 413 kitchen fixtures, capturing 69 recipes, 59K fine-grained actions, 51K audio events, 20K object movements and 37K object masks lifted to 3D. On average, we have 263 annotations per minute of our unscripted videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages.

| **[MD-BERT: Action Recognition in Dark Videos via Dynamic Multi-Stream Fusion and Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03724v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition in dark, low-light (under-exposed) or noisy videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes MD-BERT, a novel multi-stream approach that integrates complementary pre-processing techniques such as gamma correction and histogram equalization alongside raw dark frames to address these challenges. We introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, extending existing attentional fusion methods to a three-stream setting, thereby capturing fine-grained and global contextual information across different brightness and contrast enhancements. The fused spatiotemporal features are then processed by a BERT-based temporal model, which leverages its bidirectional self-attention to effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships across frames. Extensive experiments on the ARID V1.0 and ARID V1.5 dark video datasets show that MD-BERT outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each input stream and the effectiveness of the proposed DFF and BERT modules.

| **[Identity-free Artificial Emotional Intelligence via Micro-Gesture Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13206v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on a special group of human body language -- the micro-gesture (MG), which differs from the range of ordinary illustrative gestures in that they are not intentional behaviors performed to convey information to others, but rather unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings. This characteristic introduces two novel challenges regarding micro-gestures that are worth rethinking. The first is whether strategies designed for other action recognition are entirely applicable to micro-gestures. The second is whether micro-gestures, as supplementary data, can provide additional insights for emotional understanding. In recognizing micro-gestures, we explored various augmentation strategies that take into account the subtle spatial and brief temporal characteristics of micro-gestures, often accompanied by repetitiveness, to determine more suitable augmentation methods. Considering the significance of temporal domain information for micro-gestures, we introduce a simple and efficient plug-and-play spatiotemporal balancing fusion method. We not only studied our method on the considered micro-gesture dataset but also conducted experiments on mainstream action datasets. The results show that our approach performs well in micro-gesture recognition and on other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous micro-gesture recognition methods. For emotional understanding based on micro-gestures, we construct complex emotional reasoning scenarios. Our evaluation, conducted with large language models, shows that micro-gestures play a significant and positive role in enhancing comprehensive emotional understanding. The scenarios we developed can be extended to other micro-gesture-based tasks such as deception detection and interviews. We confirm that our new insights contribute to advancing research in micro-gesture and emotional artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pr...</summary><p>We provide a link to the public release of the code and data in this new version</p></details> | None |
| **[SKI Models: Skeleton Induced Vision-Language Embeddings for Understanding Activities of Daily Living](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03459v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of vision-language models like CLIP has enabled the development of foundational video models capable of generalizing to unseen videos and human actions. However, these models are typically trained on web videos, which often fail to capture the challenges present in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) videos. Existing works address ADL-specific challenges, such as similar appearances, subtle motion patterns, and multiple viewpoints, by combining 3D skeletons and RGB videos. However, these approaches are not integrated with language, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen action classes. In this paper, we introduce SKI models, which integrate 3D skeletons into the vision-language embedding space. SKI models leverage a skeleton-language model, SkeletonCLIP, to infuse skeleton information into Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) through collaborative training. Notably, SKI models do not require skeleton data during inference, enhancing their robustness for real-world applications. The effectiveness of SKI models is validated on three popular ADL datasets for zero-shot action recognition and video caption generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Advances in Multimodal Adaptation and Generalization: From Traditional Approaches to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18592v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions.

| **[HFGCN:Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11007v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, action recognition has received much attention and wide application due to its important role in video understanding. Most of the researches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance via various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton points. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was seldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to classify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point in terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological relations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation classification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To synthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a novel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the proposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different body parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the recognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the categorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the hypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order relationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation of the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and hypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and channel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ALBAR: Adversarial Learning approach to mitigate Biases in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00156v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in machine learning models can lead to unfair decision making, and while it has been well-studied in the image and text domains, it remains underexplored in action recognition. Action recognition models often suffer from background bias (i.e., inferring actions based on background cues) and foreground bias (i.e., relying on subject appearance), which can be detrimental to real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles or assisted living monitoring. While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background bias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both biases. We propose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that mitigates foreground and background biases without requiring specialized knowledge of the bias attributes. Our framework applies an adversarial cross-entropy loss to the sampled static clip (where all the frames are the same) and aims to make its class probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy maximization loss. Additionally, we introduce a gradient penalty loss for regularization against the debiasing process. We evaluate our method on established background and foreground bias protocols, setting a new state-of-the-art and strongly improving combined debiasing performance by over 12% on HMDB51. Furthermore, we identify an issue of background leakage in the existing UCF101 protocol for bias evaluation which provides a shortcut to predict actions and does not provide an accurate measure of the debiasing capability of a model. We address this issue by proposing more fine-grained segmentation boundaries for the actor, where our method also outperforms existing approaches.

Specifically, our CSVR consists of three branches: a generative pose prediction branch, a discriminative context matching branch, and a video generating branch. Among them, the first one encodes dynamic motion feature by utilizing Conditional-GAN to predict the human poses of future frames, and the second branch extracts static context features by contrasting positive and negative video feature and I-frame feature pairs. The third branch is designed to generate both current and future video frames, for the purpose of collaboratively improving dynamic motion features and static context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple popular video datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization, which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as ActionFormer and WiFiTAD. We envision XRF V2 as a valuable resource for advancing research in human action localization, action forecasting, pose estimation, multimodal foundation models pre-training, synthetic data generation, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Mamba Fusion: Learning Actions Through Questioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11513v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for generalizing across diverse tasks and using language cues to enhance learning. While transformer-based architectures have been the de facto in vision-language training, they face challenges like quadratic computational complexity, high GPU memory usage, and difficulty with long-term dependencies. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaVL, a novel model that leverages recent advancements in selective state space modality fusion to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and learn joint representations for vision and language data. MambaVL utilizes a shared state transition matrix across both modalities, allowing the model to capture information about actions from multiple perspectives within the scene. Furthermore, we propose a question-answering task that helps guide the model toward relevant cues. These questions provide critical information about actions, objects, and environmental context, leading to enhanced performance. As a result, MambaVL achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition on the Epic-Kitchens-100 dataset and outperforms baseline methods in action anticipation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bones of Contention: Exploring Query-Efficient Attacks Against Skeleton Recognition Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16843v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton action recognition models have secured more attention than video-based ones in various applications due to privacy preservation and lower storage requirements. Skeleton data are typically transmitted to cloud servers for action recognition, with results returned to clients via Apps/APIs. However, the vulnerability of skeletal models against adversarial perturbations gradually reveals the unreliability of these systems. Existing black-box attacks all operate in a decision-based manner, resulting in numerous queries that hinder efficiency and feasibility in real-world applications. Moreover, all attacks off the shelf focus on only restricted perturbations, while ignoring model weaknesses when encountered with non-semantic perturbations. In this paper, we propose two query-effIcient Skeletal Adversarial AttaCks, ISAAC-K and ISAAC-N. As a black-box attack, ISAAC-K utilizes Grad-CAM in a surrogate model to extract key joints where minor sparse perturbations are then added to fool the classifier. To guarantee natural adversarial motions, we introduce constraints of both bone length and temporal consistency. ISAAC-K finds stronger adversarial examples on $\ell_\infty$ norm, which can encompass those on other norms. Exhaustive experiments substantiate that ISAAC-K can uplift the attack efficiency of the perturbations under 10 skeletal models. Additionally, as a byproduct, ISAAC-N fools the classifier by replacing skeletons unrelated to the action. We surprisingly find that skeletal models are vulnerable to large perturbations where the part-wise non-semantic joints are just replaced, leading to a query-free no-box attack without any prior knowledge. Based on that, four adaptive defenses are eventually proposed to improve the robustness of skeleton recognition models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures | None |

| **[Optimizing Human Pose Estimation Through Focused Human and Joint Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14439v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has given rise to a broad spectrum of novel and compelling applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, as well as surveillance. However, accurate video pose estimation remains an open challenge. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that existing methods learn motion clues from all pixels rather than focusing on the target human body, making them easily misled and disrupted by unimportant information such as background changes or movements of other people. Additionally, while the current Transformer-based pose estimation methods has demonstrated impressive performance with global modeling, they struggle with local context perception and precise positional identification. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose a bilayer Human-Keypoint Mask module that performs coarse-to-fine visual token refinement, which gradually zooms in on the target human body and keypoints while masking out unimportant figure regions. (2) We further introduce a novel deformable cross attention mechanism and a bidirectional separation strategy to adaptively aggregate spatial and temporal motion clues from constrained surrounding contexts. (3) We mathematically formulate the deformable cross attention, constraining that the model focuses solely on the regions centered at the target person body. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmark datasets. A remarkable highlight is that our method achieves an 84.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging wrist joint, which significantly outperforms the 81.5 mAP achieved by the current state-of-the-art method on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MV-GMN: State Space Model for Multi-View Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13829v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multi-view action recognition have largely relied on Transformer-based models. While effective and adaptable, these models often require substantial computational resources, especially in scenarios with multiple views and multiple temporal sequences. Addressing this limitation, this paper introduces the MV-GMN model, a state-space model specifically designed to efficiently aggregate multi-modal data (RGB and skeleton), multi-view perspectives, and multi-temporal information for action recognition with reduced computational complexity. The MV-GMN model employs an innovative Multi-View Graph Mamba network comprising a series of MV-GMN blocks. Each block includes a proposed Bidirectional State Space Block and a GCN module. The Bidirectional State Space Block introduces four scanning strategies, including view-prioritized and time-prioritized approaches. The GCN module leverages rule-based and KNN-based methods to construct the graph network, effectively integrating features from different viewpoints and temporal instances. Demonstrating its efficacy, MV-GMN outperforms the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, achieving notable accuracies of 97.3\% and 96.7\% on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset in cross-subject and cross-view scenarios, respectively. MV-GMN also surpasses Transformer-based baselines while requiring only linear inference complexity, underscoring the model's ability to reduce computational load and enhance the scalability and applicability of multi-view action recognition technologies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SMART-Vision: Survey of Modern Action Recognition Techniques in Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13066v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is a challenging domain in computer vision, involving recognizing complex patterns by analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of individuals' movements in videos. These patterns arise in sequential data, such as video frames, which are often essential to accurately distinguish actions that would be ambiguous in a single image. HAR has garnered considerable interest due to its broad applicability, ranging from robotics and surveillance systems to sports motion analysis, healthcare, and the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles. While several taxonomies have been proposed to categorize HAR approaches in surveys, they often overlook hybrid methodologies and fail to demonstrate how different models incorporate various architectures and modalities. In this comprehensive survey, we present the novel SMART-Vision taxonomy, which illustrates how innovations in deep learning for HAR complement one another, leading to hybrid approaches beyond traditional categories.

Action recognition models need to represent the action itself, not the appearance. However, some fully-supervised works show that models often rely on static appearances, such as the background and objects, rather than human actions. This issue, known as static bias, has not been investigated for zero-shot. Although CLIP-based zero-shot models are now common, it remains unclear if they sufficiently focus on human actions, as CLIP primarily captures appearance features related to languages. In this paper, we investigate the influence of static bias in zero-shot action recognition with CLIP-based models. Our approach involves masking backgrounds, objects, and people differently during training and validation. Experiments with masking background show that models depend on background bias as their performance decreases for Kinetics400. However, for Mimetics, which has a weak background bias, masking the background leads to improved performance even if the background is masked during validation. Furthermore, masking both the background and objects in different colors improves performance for SSv2, which has a strong object bias. These results suggest that masking the background or objects during training prevents models from overly depending on static bias and makes them focus more on human action.</p></details> | In proc. of MMM2025 | None |

To address this we introduce BlanketGen2-Fit3D (BG2-Fit3D), an augmentation of Fit3D dataset that contains 1,217,312 frames with synthetic photo-realistic blankets. To generate it we used BlanketGen2, our new and improved version of our BlanketGen pipeline that simulates synthetic blankets using ground-truth Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) meshes and then renders them as transparent images that can be layered on top of the original frames. This dataset was used in combination with the original Fit3D to finetune the ViTPose-B HPE model, to evaluate synthetic blanket augmentation effectiveness. The trained models were further evaluated on a real-world blanket occluded in-bed HPE dataset (SLP dataset). Comparing architectures trained on only Fit3D with the ones trained with our synthetic blanket augmentation the later improved pose estimation performance on BG2-Fit3D, the synthetic blanket occluded dataset significantly to (0.977 Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), 0.149 Normalized Mean Error (NME)) with an absolute 4.4% PCK increase. Furthermore, the test results on SLP demonstrated the utility of synthetic data augmentation by improving performance by an absolute 2.3% PCK, on real-world images with the poses occluded by real blankets. These results show synthetic blanket augmentation has the potential to improve in-bed blanket occluded HPE from RGB images. The dataset as well as the code will be made available to the public.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

By observing humans performing multi-step tasks, one can build assistants that have situational awareness of actions and tasks being performed, enabling them to cater assistance based on this understanding. In this paper, we develop a Context-aware Instructional Task Assistant with Multi-modal Large Language Models (InsTALL) that leverages an online visual stream (e.g. a user's screen share or video recording) and responds in real-time to user queries related to the task at hand. To enable useful assistance, InsTALL 1) trains a multi-modal model on task videos and paired textual data, and 2) automatically extracts task graph from video data and leverages it at training and inference time. We show InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance across proposed sub-tasks considered for multimodal activity understanding -- task recognition (TR), action recognition (AR), next action prediction (AP), and plan prediction (PP) -- and outperforms existing baselines on two novel sub-tasks related to automatic error identification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DSTSA-GCN: Advancing Skeleton-Based Gesture Recognition with Semantic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Topology Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12086v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for skeleton-based action and gesture recognition, thanks to their ability to model spatial and temporal dependencies in skeleton data. However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> | None |

In light of this, data collected through monitoring can provide essential insights, and information for decision-making aimed at preserving global biodiversity. Despite the importance of such data, there is a notable scarcity of datasets featuring videos of birds, and none of the existing datasets offer detailed annotations of bird behaviors in video format. In response to this gap, our study introduces the first fine-grained video dataset specifically designed for bird behavior detection and species classification. This dataset addresses the need for comprehensive bird video datasets and provides detailed data on bird actions, facilitating the development of deep learning models to recognize these, similar to the advancements made in human action recognition. The proposed dataset comprises 178 videos recorded in Spanish wetlands, capturing 13 different bird species performing 7 distinct behavior classes. In addition, we also present baseline results using state of the art models on two tasks: bird behavior recognition and species classification.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods still struggle to recognise seen actions on unseen objects due to the limitations in representing object shape and movement using 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, the reliance on object templates at test time limits their generalisability to unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage superquadrics as an alternative 3D object representation to bounding boxes and demonstrate their effectiveness on both template-free object reconstruction and action recognition tasks. Moreover, as we find that pure appearance-based methods can outperform the unified methods, the potential benefits from 3D geometric information remain unclear. Therefore, we study the compositionality of actions by considering a more challenging task where the training combinations of verbs and nouns do not overlap with the testing split. We extend H2O and FPHA datasets with compositional splits and design a novel collaborative learning framework that can explicitly reason about the geometric relations between hands and the manipulated object. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-arts in (compositional) action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Improving Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Interactive Object Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05066v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human skeleton information is important in skeleton-based action recognition, which provides a simple and efficient way to describe human pose. However, existing skeleton-based methods focus more on the skeleton, ignoring the objects interacting with humans, resulting in poor performance in recognizing actions that involve object interactions. We propose a new action recognition framework introducing object nodes to supplement absent interactive object information. We also propose Spatial Temporal Variable Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-VGCN) to effectively model the Variable Graph (VG) containing object nodes. Specifically, in order to validate the role of interactive object information, by leveraging a simple self-training approach, we establish a new dataset, JXGC 24, and an extended dataset, NTU RGB+D+Object 60, including more than 2 million additional object nodes. At the same time, we designe the Variable Graph construction method to accommodate a variable number of nodes for graph structure. Additionally, we are the first to explore the overfitting issue introduced by incorporating additional object information, and we propose a VG-based data augmentation method to address this issue, called Random Node Attack. Finally, regarding the network structure, we introduce two fusion modules, CAF and WNPool, along with a novel Node Balance Loss, to enhance the comprehensive performance by effectively fusing and balancing skeleton and object node information. Our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. The accuracy of our method on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split is 96.7\%, and on cross-view split, it is 99.2\%.</p></details> |  | None |

Addressing this issue calls for the development of robust video analysis tools. This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate streamlined video analysis. Our tool aims to deliver tailored textual summaries of user-defined queries, offering a focused insight amidst extensive video datasets. Unlike conventional frameworks that offer generic summaries or limited action recognition, our method harnesses the power of GenAI to distil relevant information, enhancing analysis precision and efficiency. Employing YOLO-V8 for object detection and Gemini for comprehensive video and text analysis, our solution achieves heightened contextual accuracy. By combining YOLO with Gemini, our approach furnishes textual summaries extracted from extensive CCTV footage, enabling users to swiftly navigate and verify pertinent events without the need for exhaustive manual review. The quantitative evaluation revealed a similarity of 72.8%, while the qualitative assessment rated an accuracy of 85%, demonstrating the capability of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[High-Performance Inference Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18710v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the significant achievements have been made in skeleton-based human action recognition with the emergence of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models used for this task focus on constructing more complex higher-order connections between joint nodes to describe skeleton information, which leads to complex inference processes and high computational costs. To address the slow inference speed caused by overly complex model structures, we introduce re-parameterization and over-parameterization techniques to GCNs and propose two novel high-performance inference GCNs, namely HPI-GCN-RP and HPI-GCN-OP. After the completion of model training, model parameters are fixed. HPI-GCN-RP adopts re-parameterization technique to transform high-performance training model into fast inference model through linear transformations, which achieves a higher inference speed with competitive model performance. HPI-GCN-OP further utilizes over-parameterization technique to achieve higher performance improvement by introducing additional inference parameters, albeit with slightly decreased inference speed. The experimental results on the two skeleton-based action recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our HPI-GCN-OP achieves performance comparable to the current SOTA models, with inference speeds five times faster. Specifically, our HPI-GCN-OP achieves an accuracy of 93\% on the cross-subject split of the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset, and 90.1\% on the cross-subject benchmark of the NTU-RGB+D 120 dataset.

Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton sequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around human physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework. Alternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture higher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex joint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces motion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a fresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action recognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both traditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN and Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal graph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against motion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of Taylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion dynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This study underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to effectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action recognition.</p></details> | Research report | None |

While recent developments, driven by powerful large language models (LLMs), aim to be general enough to cover a wide range of categories, they often overlook the need for more specific capabilities. In this work, we address the more challenging task of Fine-grained Action Recognition (FAR), which focuses on detailed semantic labels within shorter temporal duration (e.g., "salto backward tucked with 1 turn"). Given the high costs of annotating fine-grained labels and the substantial data needed for fine-tuning LLMs, we propose to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our framework, SeFAR, incorporates several innovative designs to tackle these challenges. Specifically, to capture sufficient visual details, we construct Dual-level temporal elements as more effective representations, based on which we design a new strong augmentation strategy for the Teacher-Student learning paradigm through involving moderate temporal perturbation. Furthermore, to handle the high uncertainty within the teacher model's predictions for FAR, we propose the Adaptive Regulation to stabilize the learning process. Experiments show that SeFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FAR datasets, FineGym and FineDiving, across various data scopes. It also outperforms other semi-supervised methods on two classical coarse-grained datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51. Further analysis and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our designs. Additionally, we show that the features extracted by our SeFAR could largely promote the ability of multimodal foundation models to understand fine-grained and domain-specific semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025; Code: https://github.com/KyleHuang9/SeFAR</p></details> | None |

These events provide rich motion cues that can be exploited for various computer vision tasks, such as action recognition. However, most existing DVS-based action recognition methods lose temporal information during data transformation or suffer from noise and outliers caused by sensor imperfections or environmental factors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that preserves and exploits the spatiotemporal structure of event data for action recognition. Our framework consists of two main components: 1) a point-wise event masked autoencoder (MAE) that learns a compact and discriminative representation of event patches by reconstructing them from masked raw event camera points data; 2) an improved event points patch generation algorithm that leverages an event data inlier model and point-wise data augmentation techniques to enhance the quality and diversity of event points patches. To the best of our knowledge, our approach introduces the pre-train method into event camera raw points data for the first time, and we propose a novel event points patch embedding to utilize transformer-based models on event cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> | None |

Unlike images, videos possess an additional temporal dimension, which harbors considerable redundant information, making condensation even more crucial. However, video dataset condensation still remains an underexplored area. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a large-scale empirical study with systematic design and fair comparison. Specifically, our work delves into three key aspects to provide valuable empirical insights: (1) temporal processing of video data, (2) establishing a comprehensive evaluation protocol for video dataset condensation, and (3) adaptation of condensation methods to the space-time domain and fair comparisons among them. From this study, we derive several intriguing observations: (i) sample diversity appears to be more crucial than temporal diversity for video dataset condensation, (ii) simple slide-window sampling proves to be effective, and (iii) sample selection currently outperforms dataset distillation in most cases. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on three prominent action recognition datasets (HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics-400) and achieve state-of-the-art results on all of them.

| **[Frequency-aware Event Cloud Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20803v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are biologically inspired sensors that emit events asynchronously with remarkable temporal resolution, garnering significant attention from both industry and academia. Mainstream methods favor frame and voxel representations, which reach a satisfactory performance while introducing time-consuming transformation, bulky models, and sacrificing fine-grained temporal information. Alternatively, Point Cloud representation demonstrates promise in addressing the mentioned weaknesses, but it ignores the polarity information, and its models have limited proficiency in abstracting long-term events' features. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware network named FECNet that leverages Event Cloud representations. FECNet fully utilizes 2S-1T-1P Event Cloud by innovating the event-based Group and Sampling module. To accommodate the long sequence events from Event Cloud, FECNet embraces feature extraction in the frequency domain via the Fourier transform. This approach substantially extinguishes the explosion of Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) while effectively abstracting spatial-temporal features. We conducted extensive experiments on event-based object classification, action recognition, and human pose estimation tasks, and the results substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of FECNet.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

However, the complexity and high parameter count demands of these models hinder their practical applications, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose FreqMixForemrV2, which was built upon the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer) for identifying subtle and discriminative actions with pioneered frequency-domain analysis. We design a lightweight architecture that maintains robust performance while significantly reducing the model complexity. This is achieved through a redesigned frequency operator that optimizes high-frequency and low-frequency parameter adjustments, and a simplified frequency-aware attention module. These improvements result in a substantial reduction in model parameters, enabling efficient deployment with only a minimal sacrifice in accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations of standard datasets (NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a superior balance between efficiency and accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with only 60% of the parameters.</p></details> | IEEE FG2025 | None |

Existing models for individuals often fall short in this task due to the inherent distribution discrepancies among entity skeletons, leading to suboptimal backbone optimization. To this end, we introduce a Convex Hull Adaptive Shift based multi-Entity action recognition method (CHASE), which mitigates inter-entity distribution gaps and unbiases subsequent backbones. Specifically, CHASE comprises a learnable parameterized network and an auxiliary objective. The parameterized network achieves plausible, sample-adaptive repositioning of skeleton sequences through two key components. First, the Implicit Convex Hull Constrained Adaptive Shift ensures that the new origin of the coordinate system is within the skeleton convex hull. Second, the Coefficient Learning Block provides a lightweight parameterization of the mapping from skeleton sequences to their specific coefficients in convex combinations. Moreover, to guide the optimization of this network for discrepancy minimization, we propose the Mini-batch Pair-wise Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the additional objective. CHASE operates as a sample-adaptive normalization method to mitigate inter-entity distribution discrepancies, thereby reducing data bias and improving the subsequent classifier's multi-entity action recognition performance. Extensive experiments on six datasets, including NTU Mutual 11/26, H2O, Assembly101, Collective Activity and Volleyball, consistently verify our approach by seamlessly adapting to single-entity backbones and boosting their performance in multi-entity scenarios.

Specifically, most Asian scenarios are far more complex, involving numerous objects with distinct motions and behaviors. Addressing this gap, we present a new dataset, DAVE, designed for evaluating perception methods with high representation of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs: e.g. pedestrians, animals, motorbikes, and bicycles) in complex and unpredictable environments. DAVE is a manually annotated dataset encompassing 16 diverse actor categories (spanning animals, humans, vehicles, etc.) and 16 action types (complex and rare cases like cut-ins, zigzag movement, U-turn, etc.), which require high reasoning ability. DAVE densely annotates over 13 million bounding boxes (bboxes) actors with identification, and more than 1.6 million boxes are annotated with both actor identification and action/behavior details. The videos within DAVE are collected based on a broad spectrum of factors, such as weather conditions, the time of day, road scenarios, and traffic density. DAVE can benchmark video tasks like Tracking, Detection, Spatiotemporal Action Localization, Language-Visual Moment retrieval, and Multi-label Video Action Recognition. Given the critical importance of accurately identifying VRUs to prevent accidents and ensure road safety, in DAVE, vulnerable road users constitute 41.13% of instances, compared to 23.71% in Waymo. DAVE provides an invaluable resource for the development of more sensitive and accurate visual perception algorithms in the complex real world. Our experiments show that existing methods suffer degradation in performance when evaluated on DAVE, highlighting its benefit for future video recognition research.</p></details> |  | None |

Current state-of-the-art methods tend to consider only the dependencies between connected skeletal joints, limiting their ability to capture non-linear dependencies between physically distant joints. Moreover, most existing approaches distinguish action classes by estimating the probability density of motion representations, yet the high-dimensional nature of human motions invokes inherent difficulties in accomplishing such measurements. In this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from two directions: (1) We propose a novel dependency refinement approach that explicitly models dependencies between any pair of joints, effectively transcending the limitations imposed by joint distance. (2) We further propose a framework that utilizes the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion to differentiate action classes without being affected by data dimensionality, and mathematically derive learning objectives guaranteeing precise recognition. Empirically, our approach sets the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition, which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC) layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph convolution operations. Extensive experiments on a challenging hand-to-hand interaction dataset, i.e., the Assembely101 dataset, and two large-scale human-to-human interaction datasets, i.e., NTU60-Interaction and NTU120-Interaction consistently verify the superiority of our proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based and Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the high computational complexity of mainstream Transformer-based methods limits their application. Recent Mamba demonstrates efficiency in modeling long sequences, but directly applying Mamba to FSAR overlooks the importance of local feature modeling and alignment. Moreover, long sub-sequences within the same class accumulate intra-class variance, which adversely impacts FSAR performance. To solve these challenges, we propose a Matryoshka MAmba and CoNtrasTive LeArning framework (Manta). Firstly, the Matryoshka Mamba introduces multiple Inner Modules to enhance local feature representation, rather than directly modeling global features. An Outer Module captures dependencies of timeline between these local features for implicit temporal alignment. Secondly, a hybrid contrastive learning paradigm, combining both supervised and unsupervised methods, is designed to mitigate the negative effects of intra-class variance accumulation. The Matryoshka Mamba and the hybrid contrastive learning paradigm operate in two parallel branches within Manta, enhancing Mamba for FSAR of long sub-sequence.

| **[Video Domain Incremental Learning for Human Action Recognition in Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16946v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is significantly challenging to recognize daily human actions in homes due to the diversity and dynamic changes in unconstrained home environments. It spurs the need to continually adapt to various users and scenes. Fine-tuning current video understanding models on newly encountered domains often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the models lose their ability to perform well on previously learned scenarios. To address this issue, we formalize the problem of Video Domain Incremental Learning (VDIL), which enables models to learn continually from different domains while maintaining a fixed set of action classes. Existing continual learning research primarily focuses on class-incremental learning, while the domain incremental learning has been largely overlooked in video understanding. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark of domain incremental human action recognition for unconstrained home environments. We design three domain split types (user, scene, hybrid) to systematically assess the challenges posed by domain shifts in real-world home settings. Furthermore, we propose a baseline learning strategy based on replay and reservoir sampling techniques without domain labels to handle scenarios with limited memory and task agnosticism. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our simple sampling and replay strategy outperforms most existing continual learning methods across the three proposed benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Still, their reliance on floating-point computations leads to high energy consumption, limiting their applicability in battery-powered devices. While energy-efficient, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) struggle to model skeleton dynamics, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose Signal-SGN (Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which utilizes the temporal dimension of skeleton sequences as the spike time steps and represents features as multi-dimensional discrete stochastic signals for temporal-frequency domain feature extraction. It combines the 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) module and the Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) module to extract features from the skeleton represented as spiking form. Additionally, the Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Feature Fusion (MWTF) module is proposed to extract dynamic spiking features and capture frequency-specific characteristics, enhancing classification performance. Experiments across three large-scale datasets reveal Signal-SGN exceeding state-of-the-art SNN-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency while attaining comparable performance with GCN methods and significantly reducing theoretical energy consumption.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods reliant on pose estimation or fancy sensor data often struggle to capture these dynamics accurately. We introduce FACTS, a novel transformer-based approach for fine-grained action recognition that processes raw video data directly, eliminating the need for pose estimation and the use of cumbersome body markers and sensors. FACTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 90% accuracy on fencing actions and 83.25% on boxing actions. Additionally, we present a new publicly available dataset featuring 8 detailed fencing actions, addressing critical gaps in sports analytics resources. Our findings enhance training, performance analysis, and spectator engagement, setting a new benchmark for action classification in tactical sports.</p></details> |  | None |

Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure, conference</p></details> | None |
| **[Synchronized and Fine-Grained Head for Skeleton-Based Ambiguous Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14833v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition using GCNs has achieved remarkable performance, but recognizing ambiguous actions, such as "waving" and "saluting", remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on a serial combination of GCNs and TCNs, where spatial and temporal features are extracted independently, leading to an unbalanced spatial-temporal information, which hinders accurate action recognition. Moreover, existing methods for ambiguous actions often overemphasize local details, resulting in the loss of crucial global context, which further complicates the task of differentiating ambiguous actions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play module called Synchronized and Fine-grained Head (SF-Head), inserted between GCN and TCN layers. SF-Head first conducts Synchronized Spatial-Temporal Extraction (SSTE) with a Feature Redundancy Loss (F-RL), ensuring a balanced interaction between the two types of features. It then performs Adaptive Cross-dimensional Feature Aggregation (AC-FA), with a Feature Consistency Loss (F-CL), which aligns the aggregated feature with their original spatial-temporal feature. This aggregation step effectively combines both global context and local details. Experimental results on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate significant improvements in distinguishing ambiguous actions. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/HaoHuang2003/SFHead.</p></details> | 20pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Samples for Micro-Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14719v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) has gained increasing attention due to its crucial role as a form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with promising potential for applications in human communication and emotion analysis. However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (\textbf{PCAN}) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. \textbf{Firstly}, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. \textbf{Secondly}, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative ($\mathbb{FN}$) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive ($\mathbb{FP}$) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. \textbf{Finally}, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches.

| **[Activity Recognition on Avatar-Anonymized Datasets with Masked Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17098v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving computer vision is an important emerging problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Prevalent methods tackling this problem use differential privacy (DP) or obfuscation techniques to protect the privacy of individuals. In both cases, the utility of the trained model is sacrificed heavily in this process. In this work, we present an anonymization pipeline that replaces sensitive human subjects in video datasets with synthetic avatars within context, employing a combined rendering and stable diffusion-based strategy. Additionally we propose masked differential privacy ({MaskDP}) to protect non-anonymized but privacy sensitive background information. MaskDP allows for controlling sensitive regions where differential privacy is applied, in contrast to applying DP on the entire input. This combined methodology provides strong privacy protection while minimizing the usual performance penalty of privacy preserving methods. Experiments on multiple challenging action recognition datasets demonstrate that our proposed techniques result in better utility-privacy trade-offs compared to standard differentially private training in the especially demanding $\epsilon<1$ regime.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in real-world scenarios, human actions often fall outside the distribution of training data, requiring a model to both recognize in-distribution (ID) actions and reject out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Despite its importance, there has been limited research on OOD detection in human actions. Existing works on OOD detection mainly focus on image data with RGB structure, and many methods are post-hoc in nature. While these methods are convenient and computationally efficient, they often lack sufficient accuracy, fail to consider the exposure of OOD samples, and ignore the application in skeleton structure data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end skeleton-based model called Skeleton-OOD, which is committed to improving the effectiveness of OOD tasks while ensuring the accuracy of ID recognition. Through extensive experiments conducted on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-400 datasets, Skeleton-OOD demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of classic OOD detection techniques in the context of skeleton-based action recognition tasks, offering promising avenues for future research in this field.

| **[Do Language Models Understand Time?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13845v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.</p></details> | Research report | None |
| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.

Optical flow serves as a fundamental building block for various video-related tasks, such as video restoration, motion estimation, video stabilization, object tracking, action recognition, and video generation. While current state-of-the-art methods prioritize accuracy, they often overlook constraints regarding speed and memory usage. Existing light models typically focus on reducing size but still exhibit high latency, compromise significantly on quality, or are optimized for high-performance GPUs, resulting in sub-optimal performance on mobile devices. This study aims to develop a mobile-optimized optical flow model by proposing a novel mobile device-compatible architecture, as well as enhancements to the training pipeline, which optimize the model for reduced weight, low memory utilization, and increased speed while maintaining minimal error. Our approach demonstrates superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art lightweight models on the challenging KITTI and Sintel benchmarks. Furthermore, it attains a significantly accelerated inference speed, thereby yielding real-time operational efficiency on the iPhone 8, while surpassing real-time performance levels on more advanced mobile devices.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the prevailing methods are predominantly negative-based, necessitating additional momentum encoder and memory bank to get negative samples, which increases the difficulty of model training. Furthermore, these methods primarily concentrate on learning a global representation for recognition and retrieval tasks, while overlooking the rich and detailed local representations that are crucial for dense prediction tasks. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning framework based on feature decorrelation, called USDRL, which employs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains in a multi-grained manner to reduce redundancy among dimensions of the representations to maximize information extraction from features. Additionally, we design a Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE) to capture fine-grained action representations effectively, thereby enhancing the performance of dense prediction tasks. Comprehensive experiments, conducted on the benchmarks NTU-60, NTU-120, PKU-MMD I, and PKU-MMD II, across diverse downstream tasks including action recognition, action retrieval, and action detection, conclusively demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

The reliance on high-energy-consuming continuous floating-point operations inherent in GCN-based methods poses significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained, battery-powered edge devices. To address these limitations, MK-SGN, a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation, is proposed to leverage the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for skeleton-based action recognition for the first time. By integrating the energy-saving properties of SNNs with the graph representation capabilities of GCNs, MK-SGN achieves significant reductions in energy consumption while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy. Firstly, we formulate a Spiking Multimodal Fusion (SMF) module to effectively fuse multimodal skeleton data represented as spike-form features. Secondly, we propose the Self-Attention Spiking Graph Convolution (SA-SGC) module and the Spiking Temporal Convolution (STC) module, to capture spatial relationships and temporal dynamics of spike-form features. Finally, we propose an integrated knowledge distillation strategy to transfer information from the multimodal GCN to the SGN, incorporating both intermediate-layer distillation and soft-label distillation to enhance the performance of the SGN. MK-SGN exhibits substantial advantages, surpassing state-of-the-art GCN frameworks in energy efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art SNN frameworks in recognition accuracy. The proposed method achieves a remarkable reduction in energy consumption, exceeding 98\% compared to conventional GCN-based approaches. This research establishes a robust baseline for developing high-performance, energy-efficient SNN-based models for skeleton-based action recognition</p></details> |  | None |

While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only test for static spatial reasoning, such as categorizing the relative positions of objects. Meanwhile, real-world deployment requires dynamic capabilities like perspective-taking and egocentric action recognition. As a roadmap to improving spatial intelligence, we introduce SAT, Spatial Aptitude Training, which goes beyond static relative object position questions to the more dynamic tasks. SAT contains 218K question-answer pairs for 22K synthetic scenes across a training and testing set. Generated using a photo-realistic physics engine, our dataset can be arbitrarily scaled and easily extended to new actions, scenes, and 3D assets. We find that even MLMs that perform relatively well on static questions struggle to accurately answer dynamic spatial questions. Further, we show that SAT instruction-tuning data improves not only dynamic spatial reasoning on SAT, but also zero-shot performance on existing real-image spatial benchmarks: $23\%$ on CVBench, $8\%$ on the harder BLINK benchmark, and $18\%$ on VSR. When instruction-tuned on SAT, our 13B model matches larger proprietary MLMs like GPT4-V and Gemini-3-1.0 in spatial reasoning.

However, most of the applications deployed generate a lot of false alarms (violations) because they tend to generalize the requirements of PPE across the industry and tasks. The key to resolving this issue is to understand the action being performed by the worker and customize the inference for the specific PPE requirements of that action. In this paper, we propose a system that employs activity recognition models to first understand the action being performed and then use object detection techniques to check for violations. This leads to a 23% improvement in the F1-score compared to the PPE-based approach on our test dataset of 109 videos.</p></details> |  | None |

We envision a future service scenario where wireless sensing service providers distribute sensing models to users. During usage, users might request new sensing capabilities. For example, if someone is away from home on a business trip or vacation for an extended period, they may want a new sensing capability that can detect falls in elderly parents or grandparents and promptly alert them. In this paper, we propose CCS (continuous customized service), enabling model updates on users' local computing resources without data transmission to the service providers. To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in model updates where updating model parameters to implement new capabilities leads to the loss of existing capabilities we design knowledge distillation and weight alignment modules. These modules enable the sensing model to acquire new capabilities while retaining the existing ones. We conducted extensive experiments on the large-scale XRF55 dataset across Wi-Fi, millimeter-wave radar, and RFID modalities to simulate scenarios where four users sequentially introduced new customized demands. The results affirm that CCS excels in continuous model services across all the above wireless modalities, significantly outperforming existing approaches like OneFi.</p></details> | 9 pages,8 figures | None |

However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field is the accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion. Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lack of temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-based models benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations when faced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. This challenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond their training datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in the training data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-video based TempoRally contInuous Occlusion-Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novel Test-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video. This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered during the model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisy initial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during test time, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our framework demonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use any off-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporal consistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where it not only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimation models but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions, achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.

In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.</p></details> |  | None |

OAR must operate under stringent latency constraints, making it an indispensable component for real-time feedback for edge computing. Existing methods, which typically rely on the processing of entire video clips, fall short in scenarios requiring immediate recognition. To address this, we designed EdgeOAR, a novel framework specifically designed for OAR on edge devices. EdgeOAR includes the Early Exit-oriented Task-specific Feature Enhancement Module (TFEM), which comprises lightweight submodules to optimize features in both temporal and spatial dimensions. We design an iterative training method to enable TFEM learning features from the beginning of the video. Additionally, EdgeOAR includes an Inverse Information Entropy (IIE) and Modality Consistency (MC)-driven fusion module to fuse features and make better exit decisions. This design overcomes the two main challenges: robust modeling of spatio-temporal action representations with limited initial frames in online video streams and balancing accuracy and efficiency on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments show that on the UCF-101 dataset, our method EdgeOAR reduces latency by 99.23% and energy consumption by 99.28% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. And achieves an adequate accuracy on edge devices.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures | None |

By implementing a structured, multi-directional scanning strategy within SSMs, our model captures local joint interactions and global motion patterns across multiple anatomical body parts. This anatomically-aware decomposition enhances the ability to identify subtle motion patterns critical in medical diagnosis, such as gait anomalies associated with neurological conditions.

Existing CDFSAR methods mainly focus on joint training of source and target data to mitigate the side effect of domain gap. However, such kind of methods suffer from two limitations: First, pair-wise joint training requires retraining deep models in case of one source data and multiple target ones, which incurs heavy computation cost, especially for large source and small target data. Second, pre-trained models after joint training are adopted to target domain in a straightforward manner, hardly taking full potential of pre-trained models and then limiting recognition performance. To overcome above limitations, this paper proposes a simple yet effective baseline, namely Temporal-Aware Model Tuning (TAMT) for CDFSAR. Specifically, our TAMT involves a decoupled paradigm by performing pre-training on source data and fine-tuning target data, which avoids retraining for multiple target data with single source. To effectively and efficiently explore the potential of pre-trained models in transferring to target domain, our TAMT proposes a Hierarchical Temporal Tuning Network (HTTN), whose core involves local temporal-aware adapters (TAA) and a global temporal-aware moment tuning (GTMT). Particularly, TAA learns few parameters to recalibrate the intermediate features of frozen pre-trained models, enabling efficient adaptation to target domains.

| **[Revealing Key Details to See Differences: A Novel Prototypical Perspective for Skeleton-based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18941v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In skeleton-based action recognition, a key challenge is distinguishing between actions with similar trajectories of joints due to the lack of image-level details in skeletal representations. Recognizing that the differentiation of similar actions relies on subtle motion details in specific body parts, we direct our approach to focus on the fine-grained motion of local skeleton components. To this end, we introduce ProtoGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based model that breaks down the dynamics of entire skeleton sequences into a combination of learnable prototypes representing core motion patterns of action units. By contrasting the reconstruction of prototypes, ProtoGCN can effectively identify and enhance the discriminative representation of similar actions. Without bells and whistles, ProtoGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, and FineGYM, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/firework8/ProtoGCN.</p></details> |  | None |

Current leading EAR solutions typically follow two regimes: project unconstructed event streams into dense constructed event frames and adopt powerful frame-specific networks, or employ lightweight point-specific networks to handle sparse unconstructed event points directly. However, such two regimes are blind to a fundamental issue: failing to accommodate the unique dense temporal and sparse spatial properties of asynchronous event data. In this article, we present a synergy-aware framework, i.e., EventCrab, that adeptly integrates the "lighter" frame-specific networks for dense event frames with the "heavier" point-specific networks for sparse event points, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a joint frame-text-point representation space to bridge distinct event frames and points. In specific, to better exploit the unique spatiotemporal relationships inherent in asynchronous event points, we devise two strategies for the "heavier" point-specific embedding: i) a Spiking-like Context Learner (SCL) that extracts contextualized event points from raw event streams. ii) an Event Point Encoder (EPE) that further explores event-point long spatiotemporal features in a Hilbert-scan way. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the significant performance of our proposed EventCrab, particularly gaining improvements of 5.17% on SeAct and 7.01% on HARDVS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EgoSurgery-Phase: A Dataset of Surgical Phase Recognition from Egocentric Open Surgery Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19644v3)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical phase recognition has gained significant attention due to its potential to offer solutions to numerous demands of the modern operating room. However, most existing methods concentrate on minimally invasive surgery (MIS), leaving surgical phase recognition for open surgery understudied. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the scarcity of publicly available open surgery video datasets for surgical phase recognition. To address this issue, we introduce a new egocentric open surgery video dataset for phase recognition, named EgoSurgery-Phase. This dataset comprises 15 hours of real open surgery videos spanning 9 distinct surgical phases all captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head. In addition to video, the EgoSurgery-Phase offers eye gaze. As far as we know, it is the first real open surgery video dataset for surgical phase recognition publicly available. Furthermore, inspired by the notable success of masked autoencoders (MAEs) in video understanding tasks (e.g., action recognition), we propose a gaze-guided masked autoencoder (GGMAE). Considering the regions where surgeons' gaze focuses are often critical for surgical phase recognition (e.g., surgical field), in our GGMAE, the gaze information acts as an empirical semantic richness prior to guiding the masking process, promoting better attention to semantically rich spatial regions. GGMAE significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art recognition method (6.4% in Jaccard) and the masked autoencoder-based method (3.1% in Jaccard) on EgoSurgery-Phase. The dataset is released at https://github.com/Fujiry0/EgoSurgery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> | None |

Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures | None |

Traditional models using RGB and optical flow streams achieve strong performance but at a high computational cost. To address this, we introduce a representation flow algorithm to replace the optical flow branch in the egocentric action recognition model, enabling end-to-end training while reducing computational cost and prediction time. Our model, designed for egocentric action recognition, uses class activation maps (CAMs) to improve accuracy and ConvLSTM for spatio temporal encoding with spatial attention. When evaluated on the GTEA61, EGTEA GAZE+, and HMDB datasets, our model matches the accuracy of the original model on GTEA61 and exceeds it by 0.65% and 0.84% on EGTEA GAZE+ and HMDB, respectively. Prediction runtimes are significantly reduced to 0.1881s, 0.1503s, and 0.1459s, compared to the original model's 101.6795s, 25.3799s, and 203.9958s.

| **[Pre-training for Action Recognition with Automatically Generated Fractal Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17584v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, interest in synthetic data has grown, particularly in the context of pre-training the image modality to support a range of computer vision tasks, including object classification, medical imaging etc. Previous work has demonstrated that synthetic samples, automatically produced by various generative processes, can replace real counterparts and yield strong visual representations. This approach resolves issues associated with real data such as collection and labeling costs, copyright and privacy. We extend this trend to the video domain applying it to the task of action recognition. Employing fractal geometry, we present methods to automatically produce large-scale datasets of short synthetic video clips, which can be utilized for pre-training neural models. The generated video clips are characterized by notable variety, stemmed by the innate ability of fractals to generate complex multi-scale structures. To narrow the domain gap, we further identify key properties of real videos and carefully emulate them during pre-training. Through thorough ablations, we determine the attributes that strengthen downstream results and offer general guidelines for pre-training with synthetic videos. The proposed approach is evaluated by fine-tuning pre-trained models on established action recognition datasets HMDB51 and UCF101 as well as four other video benchmarks related to group action recognition, fine-grained action recognition and dynamic scenes. Compared to standard Kinetics pre-training, our reported results come close and are even superior on a portion of downstream datasets.

Existing methods typically build the skeleton-semantics interactions by uncontrollable mappings and conspicuous representations, thereby can hardly capture the intricate and fine-grained relationship for effective cross-modal transferability. To address these issues, we propose a novel dyNamically Evolving dUal skeleton-semantic syneRgistic framework with the guidance of cOntext-aware side informatioN (dubbed Neuron), to explore more fine-grained cross-modal correspondence from micro to macro perspectives at both spatial and temporal levels, respectively. Concretely, 1) we first construct the spatial-temporal evolving micro-prototypes and integrate dynamic context-aware side information to capture the intricate and synergistic skeleton-semantic correlations step-by-step, progressively refining cross-model alignment; and 2) we introduce the spatial compression and temporal memory mechanisms to guide the growth of spatial-temporal micro-prototypes, enabling them to absorb structure-related spatial representations and regularity-dependent temporal patterns. Notably, such processes are analogous to the learning and growth of neurons, equipping the framework with the capacity to generalize to novel unseen action categories. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

Many QMIX-based methods introduce monotonicity constraints between the joint action value and individual action values to achieve decentralized execution. However, such constraints limit the representation capacity of value factorization, restricting the joint action values it can represent and hindering the learning of the optimal policy. To address this challenge, we propose the Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighted QMIX (POWQMIX) algorithm, which recognizes the potentially optimal joint actions and assigns higher weights to the corresponding losses of these joint actions during training. We theoretically prove that with such a weighted training approach the optimal policy is guaranteed to be recovered. Experiments in matrix games, difficulty-enhanced predator-prey, and StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge environments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work.

We construct OccludeNet, a large-scale occluded video dataset that includes both real-world and synthetic occlusion scene videos under various natural environments. OccludeNet features dynamic tracking occlusion, static scene occlusion, and multi-view interactive occlusion, addressing existing gaps in data. Our analysis reveals that occlusion impacts action classes differently, with actions involving low scene relevance and partial body visibility experiencing greater accuracy degradation. To overcome the limitations of current occlusion-focused approaches, we propose a structural causal model for occluded scenes and introduce the Causal Action Recognition (CAR) framework, which employs backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning. This framework enhances key actor information, improving model robustness to occlusion. We anticipate that the challenges posed by OccludeNet will stimulate further exploration of causal relations in occlusion scenarios and encourage a reevaluation of class correlations, ultimately promoting sustainable performance improvements. The code and full dataset will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences.To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the motion on each joint in the pose at each time step extracted from 3D pose sequences, we hierarchically pool these joint motions in a bottom-up manner in the encoder, following the kinematic chains in the human body. We also constrain the latent embeddings of the encoder to contain the space of psychologically-motivated affective features underlying the gaits. We train the decoder to reconstruct the motions per joint per time step in a top-down manner from the latent embeddings. For the annotated data, we also train a classifier to map the latent embeddings to emotion labels. Our semi-supervised approach achieves a mean average precision of 0.84 on the Emotion-Gait benchmark dataset, which contains both labeled and unlabeled gaits collected from multiple sources. We outperform current state-of-art algorithms for both emotion recognition and action recognition from 3D gaits by 7%--23% on the absolute.

| **[When Spatial meets Temporal in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15284v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition has made significant strides, but challenges remain in effectively using both spatial and temporal information. While existing methods often focus on either spatial features (e.g., object appearance) or temporal dynamics (e.g., motion), they rarely address the need for a comprehensive integration of both. Capturing the rich temporal evolution of video frames, while preserving their spatial details, is crucial for improving accuracy. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Integration and Motion Enhancement (TIME) layer, a novel preprocessing technique designed to incorporate temporal information. The TIME layer generates new video frames by rearranging the original sequence, preserving temporal order while embedding $N^2$ temporally evolving frames into a single spatial grid of size $N \times N$. This transformation creates new frames that balance both spatial and temporal information, making them compatible with existing video models. When $N=1$, the layer captures rich spatial details, similar to existing methods. As $N$ increases ($N\geq2$), temporal information becomes more prominent, while the spatial information decreases to ensure compatibility with model inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TIME layer by integrating it into popular action recognition models, such as ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, and Video Masked Autoencoders, for both RGB and depth video data. Our experiments show that the TIME layer enhances recognition accuracy, offering valuable insights for video processing tasks.</p></details> | Research report | None |

In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site) |

However, the existing GCNs rely on the binary connection of two neighbouring vertices (joints) formed by an edge (bone), overlooking the potential of constructing multi-vertex convolution structures. In this paper we address this oversight and explore the merits of a hyper-graph convolutional network (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information conveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively optimises multi-scale hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven multi-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets, demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we outperform the existing solutions on NTU-120, achieving 90.2\% and 91.4\% in terms of the top-1 recognition accuracy on X-Sub and X-Set.</p></details> |  | None |

In the WSLR problem, a method designed for action recognition has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy. Indeed, it sounds reasonable for an action recognition method to perform well on WSLR because sign language is regarded as an action. However, a careful evaluation of the tasks reveals that the tasks of action recognition and WSLR are inherently different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel WSLR method that takes into account information specifically useful for the WSLR problem. We realize it as a multi-stream neural network (MSNN), which consist of three streams: 1) base stream, 2) local image stream, and 3) skeleton stream. Each stream is designed to handle different types of information. The base stream deals with quick and detailed movements of the hands and body, the local image stream focuses on handshapes and facial expressions, and the skeleton stream captures the relative positions of the body and both hands. This approach allows us to combine various types of data for more comprehensive gesture analysis. Experimental results on the WLASL and MS-ASL datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method; it achieved an improvement of approximately 10\%--15\% in Top-1 accuracy when compared with conventional methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most of these methods tend to construct complex topology learning mechanisms while neglecting the inherent symmetry of the human body. Additionally, the use of temporal convolutions with certain fixed receptive fields limits their capacity to effectively capture dependencies in time sequences. To address the issues, we (1) propose a novel Topological Symmetry Enhanced Graph Convolution (TSE-GC) to enable distinct topology learning across different channel partitions while incorporating topological symmetry awareness and (2) construct a Multi-Branch Deformable Temporal Convolution (MBDTC) for skeleton-based action recognition. The proposed TSE-GC emphasizes the inherent symmetry of the human body while enabling efficient learning of dynamic topologies. Meanwhile, the design of MBDTC introduces the concept of deformable modeling, leading to more flexible receptive fields and stronger modeling capacity of temporal dependencies. Combining TSE-GC with MBDTC, our final model, TSE-GCN, achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods on three large datasets, NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA. On the cross-subject and cross-set evaluations of NTU RGB+D 120, the accuracies of our model reach 90.0\% and 91.1\%, with 1.1M parameters and 1.38 GFLOPS for one stream.</p></details> |  | None |

Although a wide range of spatial and temporal alignment modules have been proposed, they primarily address spatial or temporal misalignments at the video level, while the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level remain underexplored. Recent studies utilize class prototypes to learn task-specific features but overlook the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level, especially in the spatial dimension, where these relationships provide rich information. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Motion-Guided Attention Learning method (called DMGAL) for few-shot action recognition, aiming to learn the spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific to the task-specific level. To achieve this, we propose a carefully designed Motion-Guided Attention (MGA) method to identify and correlate motion-related region features from the video level to the task level. Specifically, the Self Motion-Guided Attention module (S-MGA) achieves spatio-temporal relation modeling at the video level by identifying and correlating motion-related region features between different frames within a video. The Cross Motion-Guided Attention module (C-MGA) identifies and correlates motion-related region features between frames of different videos within a specific task to achieve spatio-temporal relationships at the task level. This approach enables the model to construct class prototypes that fully incorporate spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific level to the task-specific level. We validate the effectiveness of our DMGAL method by employing both fully fine-tuning and adapter-tuning paradigms. The models developed using these paradigms are termed DMGAL-FT and DMGAL-Adapter, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Within any single domain, actions can often appear quite similar, making it challenging for deep models to distinguish them accurately. To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal foundation models in helping us recognize such actions, we present ActionAtlas v1.0, a multiple-choice video question answering benchmark featuring short videos across various sports. Each video in the dataset is paired with a question and four or five choices. The question pinpoints specific individuals, asking which choice "best" describes their action within a certain temporal context. Overall, the dataset includes 934 videos showcasing 580 unique actions across 56 sports, with a total of 1896 actions within choices. Unlike most existing video question answering benchmarks that only cover simplistic actions, often identifiable from a single frame, ActionAtlas focuses on intricate movements and rigorously tests the model's capability to discern subtle differences between moves that look similar within each domain. We evaluate open and proprietary foundation models on this benchmark, finding that the best model, GPT-4o, achieves a maximum accuracy of 45.52%. Meanwhile, Non-expert crowd workers, provided with action description for each choice, achieve 61.64% accuracy, where random chance is approximately 21%. Our findings with state-of-the-art models indicate that having a high frame sampling rate is important for accurately recognizing actions in ActionAtlas, a feature that some leading proprietary video models, such as Gemini, do not include in their default configuration.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, the proposed linear complexity LCR incorporates a novel Cross RWKV gate to facilitate interaction be tween current frame edge information and past features, enhancing the focus on the subject through edge features and globally aggregating inter-frame features over time. LCR stores long-term mem ory for video processing through an enhanced LSTM recurrent execution mechanism. By leveraging the Cross RWKV gate and recurrent execution, LCR effectively captures both spatial and temporal features. Additionally, the edge information serves as a forgetting gate for LSTM, guiding long-term memory management.Tube masking strategy reduces redundant information in food and reduces overfitting.These advantages enable LSTM CrossRWKV to set a new benchmark in video under standing, offering a scalable and efficient solution for comprehensive video analysis.

We formalize and explore an understudied cross-modal transfer setting we term Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA), where the modality used in testing is not used in supervised training, i.e. zero labeled instances of the test modality are available during training. We develop three methods to perform UMA: Student-Teacher (ST), Contrastive Alignment (CA), and Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T). Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets compare these methods to each other in the UMA setting, and to their empirical upper bound in the supervised setting. The results indicate C3T is the most robust and highest performing by at least a margin of 8%, and nears the supervised setting performance even in the presence of temporal noise. This method introduces a novel mechanism for aligning signals across time-varying latent vectors, extracted from the receptive field of temporal convolutions. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for multi-modal learning in various applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This study uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain the decision-making process of Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) when classifying activities with skeleton data. We employ SHAP to explain two real-world datasets: one for cerebral palsy (CP) classification and the widely used NTU RGB+D 60 action recognition dataset. To test the explanation, we introduce a novel perturbation approach that modifies the model's edge importance matrix, allowing us to evaluate the impact of specific body key points on prediction outcomes. To assess the fidelity of our explanations, we employ informed perturbation, targeting body key points identified as important by SHAP and comparing them against random perturbation as a control condition. This perturbation enables a judgment on whether the body key points are truly influential or non-influential based on the SHAP values. Results on both datasets show that body key points identified as important through SHAP have the largest influence on the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity metrics. Our findings highlight that SHAP can provide granular insights into the input feature contribution to the prediction outcome of GCNs in HAR tasks. This demonstrates the potential for more interpretable and trustworthy models in high-stakes applications like healthcare or rehabilitation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AM Flow: Adapters for Temporal Processing in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02065v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, in particular \textit{image} models, have recently gained generalisability and robustness. %are becoming more general and robust by the day. In this work, we propose to exploit such advances in the realm of \textit{video} classification. Video foundation models suffer from the requirement of extensive pretraining and a large training time. Towards mitigating such limitations, we propose "\textit{Attention Map (AM) Flow}" for image models, a method for identifying pixels relevant to motion in each input video frame. In this context, we propose two methods to compute AM flow, depending on camera motion. AM flow allows the separation of spatial and temporal processing, while providing improved results over combined spatio-temporal processing (as in video models). Adapters, one of the popular techniques in parameter efficient transfer learning, facilitate the incorporation of AM flow into pretrained image models, mitigating the need for full-finetuning. We extend adapters to "\textit{temporal processing adapters}" by incorporating a temporal processing unit into the adapters. Our work achieves faster convergence, therefore reducing the number of epochs needed for training. Moreover, we endow an image model with the ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on popular action recognition datasets. This reduces training time and simplifies pretraining. We present experiments on Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and Toyota Smarthome datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art or comparable results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Badminton Action Recognition with a New Fine-Grained Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12385v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the dynamic and evolving field of computer vision, action recognition has become a key focus, especially with the advent of sophisticated methodologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Convolutional 3D, Transformer, and spatial-temporal feature fusion. These technologies have shown promising results on well-established benchmarks but face unique challenges in real-world applications, particularly in sports analysis, where the precise decomposition of activities and the distinction of subtly different actions are crucial. Existing datasets like UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics have offered a diverse range of video data for various scenarios. However, there's an increasing need for fine-grained video datasets that capture detailed categorizations and nuances within broader action categories. In this paper, we introduce the VideoBadminton dataset derived from high-quality badminton footage. Through an exhaustive evaluation of leading methodologies on this dataset, this study aims to advance the field of action recognition, particularly in badminton sports. The introduction of VideoBadminton could not only serve for badminton action recognition but also provide a dataset for recognizing fine-grained actions. The insights gained from these evaluations are expected to catalyze further research in action comprehension, especially within sports contexts.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we take an inspiration from human perception and explore a compositional approach for egocentric video representation. We introduce HENASY (Hierarchical ENtities ASsemblY), which includes a spatiotemporal token grouping mechanism to explicitly assemble dynamically evolving scene entities through time and model their relationship for video representation. By leveraging compositional structure understanding, HENASY possesses strong interpretability via visual grounding with free-form text queries. We further explore a suite of multi-grained contrastive losses to facilitate entity-centric understandings. This comprises three alignment types: video-narration, noun-entity, verb-entities alignments. Our method demonstrates strong interpretability in both quantitative and qualitative experiments; while maintaining competitive performances on five downstream tasks via zero-shot transfer or as video/text representation, including video/text retrieval, action recognition, multi-choice query, natural language query, and moments query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, to solve the skeleton action generalization problem, we present a recover-and-resample augmentation framework based on a novel complete action prior. We observe that human daily actions are confronted with temporal mismatch across different datasets, as they are usually partial observations of their complete action sequences. By recovering complete actions and resampling from these full sequences, we can generate strong augmentations for unseen domains. At the same time, we discover the nature of general action completeness within large datasets, indicated by the per-frame diversity over time. This allows us to exploit two assets of transferable knowledge that can be shared across action samples and be helpful for action completion: boundary poses for determining the action start, and linear temporal transforms for capturing global action patterns. Therefore, we formulate the recovering stage as a two-step stochastic action completion with boundary pose-conditioned extrapolation followed by smooth linear transforms. Both the boundary poses and linear transforms can be efficiently learned from the whole dataset via clustering. We validate our approach on a cross-dataset setting with three skeleton action datasets, outperforming other domain generalization approaches by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

To mediate the communication between participants, we build an AI-enhanced video analysis system incorporating multiple visual analysis modules like person detection, attribute recognition, and action recognition, to assess the performer's body language quality. A two-week field study involving 27 participants shows significant improvements in their social friendships, as indicated by self-reported questionnaires. Moreover, user experiences are investigated to highlight the potential of public video cameras as a novel communication medium for socializing in public spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as a main track paper by EAI-ArtsIT 2024</p></details> | None |

Given a series of frames as input, our method quickly and accurately extracts time-remaining and quarter values from basketball broadcast scenes. Our work intends to expedite the development of large, multi-modal video datasets to train data-hungry video models in the sports action recognition domain. Our method aligns a pre-labeled corpus of play-by-play annotations containing dense event annotations to video frames, enabling quick retrieval of labeled video segments. Unlike previous methods, we forgo the need to localize game clocks by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box object detector to find semantic text regions directly. Our end-to-end approach improves the generality of our work. Additionally, interpolation and parallelization techniques prepare our pipeline for deployment in a large computing cluster.

While humans excel at these tasks without any prior training, current AI models struggle with poor generalization performance. To close this research gap, we propose the Motion Perceiver (MP). MP solely relies on patch-level optical flows from video clips as inputs. During training, it learns prototypical flow snapshots through a competitive binding mechanism and integrates invariant motion representations to predict action labels for the given video. During inference, we evaluate the generalization ability of all AI models and humans on 62,656 video stimuli spanning 24 BMP conditions using point-light displays in neuroscience. Remarkably, MP outperforms all existing AI models with a maximum improvement of 29% in top-1 action recognition accuracy on these conditions. Moreover, we benchmark all AI models in point-light displays of two standard video datasets in computer vision. MP also demonstrates superior performance in these cases. More interestingly, via psychophysics experiments, we found that MP recognizes biological movements in a way that aligns with human behaviors.

This paper presents a graph convolution network called AtGCN for detecting ataxic gait and identifying its severity using 2D videos. The problem is especially challenging as the deviation of an ataxic gait from a healthy gait is very subtle. The datasets for ataxic gait detection are also quite small, with the largest dataset having only 149 videos. The paper addresses the first problem using special spatiotemporal graph convolution that successfully captures important gait-related features. To handle the small dataset size, a deep spatiotemporal graph convolution network pre-trained on an action recognition dataset is systematically truncated and then fine-tuned on the ataxia dataset to obtain the AtGCN model. The paper also presents an augmentation strategy that segments a video sequence into multiple gait cycles. The proposed AtGCN model then operates on a graph of body part locations belonging to a single gait cycle. The evaluation results support the strength of the proposed AtGCN model, as it outperforms the state-of-the-art in detection and severity prediction with an accuracy of 93.46% and a MAE of 0.4169, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite diverse application scenarios, systems are typically evaluated on traditional classification tasks, e.g., action recognition or temporal action segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel evaluation dataset, ProMQA, to measure system advancements in application-oriented scenarios. ProMQA consists of 401 multimodal procedural QA pairs on user recording of procedural activities coupled with their corresponding instruction. For QA annotation, we take a cost-effective human-LLM collaborative approach, where the existing annotation is augmented with LLM-generated QA pairs that are later verified by humans. We then provide the benchmark results to set the baseline performance on ProMQA. Our experiment reveals a significant gap between human performance and that of current systems, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. We hope our dataset sheds light on new aspects of models' multimodal understanding capabilities.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures | None |

Each teacher is first trained from scratch on its own dataset. Then, the teachers are combined into a joint architecture, which fuses the features of all teachers at multiple representation levels. The joint teacher architecture is fine-tuned on samples from all datasets, thus gathering useful generic information from all data samples. Finally, we employ a multi-level feature distillation procedure to transfer the knowledge to a student model for each of the considered datasets. We conduct image classification experiments on seven benchmarks, and action recognition experiments on three benchmarks. To illustrate the power of our feature distillation procedure, the student architectures are chosen to be identical to those of the individual teachers. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we combine teachers with distinct architectures. We show that our novel Multi-Level Feature Distillation (MLFD) can significantly surpass equivalent architectures that are either trained on individual datasets, or jointly trained on all datasets at once. Furthermore, we confirm that each step of the proposed training procedure is well motivated by a comprehensive ablation study. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/AdrianIordache/MLFD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Action Recognition by Leveraging the Hierarchical Structure of Actions and Textual Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21275v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequential execution of actions and their hierarchical structure consisting of different levels of abstraction, provide features that remain unexplored in the task of action recognition. In this study, we present a novel approach to improve action recognition by exploiting the hierarchical organization of actions and by incorporating contextualized textual information, including location and prior actions to reflect the sequential context. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel transformer architecture tailored for action recognition that utilizes both visual and textual features. Visual features are obtained from RGB and optical flow data, while text embeddings represent contextual information. Furthermore, we define a joint loss function to simultaneously train the model for both coarse and fine-grained action recognition, thereby exploiting the hierarchical nature of actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we extend the Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU) dataset to introduce action hierarchies, introducing the Hierarchical TSU dataset. We also conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of different methods for integrating contextual and hierarchical data on action recognition performance. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms pre-trained SOTA methods when trained with the same hyperparameters. Moreover, they also show a 17.12% improvement in top-1 accuracy over the equivalent fine-grained RGB version when using ground-truth contextual information, and a 5.33% improvement when contextual information is obtained from actual predictions.</p></details> |  | None |

Current AI-based video surveillance systems heavily rely on core computer vision models that require extensive finetuning, which is particularly difficult in surveillance settings due to limited datasets and difficult setting (viewpoint, low quality, etc.). In this work, we propose leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), known for their strong zero and few-shot generalization, to tackle video understanding tasks in surveillance. Specifically, we explore VideoLLaMA2, a state-of-the-art LVLM, and an improved token-level sampling method, Self-Reflective Sampling (Self-ReS). Our experiments on the UCF-Crime dataset show that VideoLLaMA2 represents a significant leap in zero-shot performance, with 20% boost over the baseline. Self-ReS additionally increases zero-shot action recognition performance to 44.6%. These results highlight the potential of LVLMs, paired with improved sampling techniques, for advancing surveillance video analysis in diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Idempotent Unsupervised Representation Learning for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20349v1)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, as a powerful technique for generation, also gradually become a critical tool for recognition tasks. However, in skeleton-based action recognition, the features obtained from existing pre-trained generative methods contain redundant information unrelated to recognition, which contradicts the nature of the skeleton's spatially sparse and temporally consistent properties, leading to undesirable performance. To address this challenge, we make efforts to bridge the gap in theory and methodology and propose a novel skeleton-based idempotent generative model (IGM) for unsupervised representation learning. More specifically, we first theoretically demonstrate the equivalence between generative models and maximum entropy coding, which demonstrates a potential route that makes the features of generative models more compact by introducing contrastive learning. To this end, we introduce the idempotency constraint to form a stronger consistency regularization in the feature space, to push the features only to maintain the critical information of motion semantics for the recognition task. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D and PKUMMD, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. On the NTU 60 xsub dataset, we observe a performance improvement from 84.6$\%$ to 86.2$\%$. Furthermore, in zero-shot adaptation scenarios, our model demonstrates significant efficacy by achieving promising results in cases that were previously unrecognizable.

Furthermore, we jointly profile FMs' efficacy and efficiency when adapting to general video understanding tasks using cost measurements during both training and inference. Our main findings areas follows. First, task-specialized models significantly outperform the seven FMs studied in this work, in sharp contrast to what FMs have achieved in natural language and image understanding. Second, video-native FMs, whose pretraining data mainly contains the video modality, are generally better than image-native FMs in classifying motion-rich videos, localizing actions in time, and understanding a video of more than one action. Third, the video-native FMs can perform well on video tasks under light adaptations to downstream tasks (e.g., freezing the FM backbones), while image-native FMs win in full end-to-end finetuning. The first two observations reveal the need and tremendous opportunities to conduct research on video-focused FMs, and the last confirms that both tasks and adaptation methods matter when it comes to the evaluation of FMs. Our code is released under: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/videoglue.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR | None |

Recent progress in language modeling presents opportunities to advance zero-shot video analysis, but constructing an effective semantic space relating action classes remains challenging. We address this by introducing a novel dataset, Stories, which contains rich textual descriptions for diverse action classes extracted from WikiHow articles. For each class, we extract multi-sentence narratives detailing the necessary steps, scenes, objects, and verbs that characterize the action. This contextual data enables modeling of nuanced relationships between actions, paving the way for zero-shot transfer. We also propose an approach that harnesses Stories to improve feature generation for training zero-shot classification. Without any target dataset fine-tuning, our method achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks, improving top-1 accuracy by up to 6.1%. We believe Stories provides a valuable resource that can catalyze progress in zero-shot action recognition.

Such a scenario, despite its practical relevance, is rarely addressed in existing self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods. To empower models with the capacity to address occlusion, we propose a simple and effective method. We first pre-train using occluded skeleton sequences, then use k-means clustering (KMeans) on sequence embeddings to group semantically similar samples. Next, we propose KNN-Imputation to fill in missing skeleton data based on the closest sample neighbors. Imputing incomplete skeleton sequences to create relatively complete sequences as input provides significant benefits to existing skeleton-based self-supervised methods. Meanwhile, building on the state-of-the-art Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL), we introduce an Occluded Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (OPSTL) framework.

Limited annotations hinder the model's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. While data augmentation can improve generalizability, unsupervised augmentation techniques must be applied carefully to avoid introducing noise. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses domain discrepancies by aligning conditional distributions with labeled target samples, but vanilla pseudo-labeling can lead to error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose $\mu$DAR, a novel joint optimization architecture comprised of three functions: (i) consistency regularizer between augmented samples to improve model classification generalizability, (ii) temporal ensemble for robust pseudo-label generation and (iii) conditional distribution alignment to improve domain generalizability. The temporal ensemble works by aggregating predictions from past epochs to smooth out noisy pseudo-label predictions, which are then used in the conditional distribution alignment module to minimize kernel-based class-wise conditional maximum mean discrepancy ($k$CMMD) between the source and target feature space to learn a domain invariant embedding. The consistency-regularized augmentations ensure that multiple augmentations of the same sample share the same labels; this results in (a) strong generalization with limited source domain samples and (b) consistent pseudo-label generation in target samples. The novel integration of these three modules in $\mu$DAR results in a range of $\approx$ 4-12% average macro-F1 score improvement over six state-of-the-art UDA methods in four benchmark wHAR datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, 2024</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, deep models often suffer from the overfitting effect on small-scale datasets with a limited number of training videos. A common solution is to exploit the existing image augmentation strategies for each frame individually including Mixup, Cutmix, and RandAugment, which are not particularly optimized for video data. In this paper, we propose a novel video augmentation strategy named Selective Volume Mixup (SV-Mix) to improve the generalization ability of deep models with limited training videos. SV-Mix devises a learnable selective module to choose the most informative volumes from two videos and mixes the volumes up to achieve a new training video. Technically, we propose two new modules, i.e., a spatial selective module to select the local patches for each spatial position, and a temporal selective module to mix the entire frames for each timestamp and maintain the spatial pattern. At each time, we randomly choose one of the two modules to expand the diversity of training samples. The selective modules are jointly optimized with the video action recognition framework to find the optimal augmentation strategy. We empirically demonstrate the merits of the SV-Mix augmentation on a wide range of video action recognition benchmarks and consistently boot the performances of both CNN-based and transformer-based models.</p></details> |  | None |

Event cameras offer a promising solution by capturing scene brightness changes sparsely at the pixel level, without capturing full images. Moreover, event cameras have high dynamic ranges that can effectively handle scenarios with complex lighting conditions, such as low light or high contrast environments. However, using event cameras introduces challenges in modeling the spatially sparse and high temporal resolution event data for HAR. To address these issues, we propose the SpikMamba framework, which combines the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks and the long sequence modeling capability of Mamba to efficiently capture global features from spatially sparse and high a temporal resolution event data. Additionally, to improve the locality of modeling, a spiking window-based linear attention mechanism is used. Extensive experiments show that SpikMamba achieves remarkable recognition performance, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.45%, 7.22%, 0.15%, and 3.92% on the PAF, HARDVS, DVS128, and E-FAction datasets, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/Typistchen/SpikMamba.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

In the multi-label atomic activity recognition task, the robustness of visual feature extraction remains a key challenge, which directly affects the model performance and generalization ability. To cope with these issues, our team optimized three aspects: data processing, model and post-processing. Firstly, the appropriate resolution and video sampling strategy are selected, and a fixed sampling strategy is set on the validation and test sets. Secondly, in terms of model training, the team selects a variety of visual backbone networks for feature extraction, and then introduces the action-slot model, which is trained on the training and validation sets, and reasoned on the test set. Finally, for post-processing, the team combined the strengths and weaknesses of different models for weighted fusion, and the final mAP on the test set was 58%, which is 4% higher than the challenge baseline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Storyboard guided Alignment for Fine-grained Video Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14238v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained video action recognition can be conceptualized as a video-text matching problem. Previous approaches often rely on global video semantics to consolidate video embeddings, which can lead to misalignment in video-text pairs due to a lack of understanding of action semantics at an atomic granularity level. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-granularity framework based on two observations: (i) videos with different global semantics may share similar atomic actions or appearances, and (ii) atomic actions within a video can be momentary, slow, or even non-directly related to the global video semantics. Inspired by the concept of storyboarding, which disassembles a script into individual shots, we enhance global video semantics by generating fine-grained descriptions using a pre-trained large language model. These detailed descriptions capture common atomic actions depicted in videos. A filtering metric is proposed to select the descriptions that correspond to the atomic actions present in both the videos and the descriptions. By employing global semantics and fine-grained descriptions, we can identify key frames in videos and utilize them to aggregate embeddings, thereby making the embedding more accurate. Extensive experiments on various video action recognition datasets demonstrate superior performance of our proposed method in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing work has focused on multi-view action recognition in a narrow area with strong labels available, where the onset and offset of each action are labeled at the frame-level. This study focuses on real-world scenarios where cameras are distributed to capture a wide-range area with only weak labels available at the video-level. We propose the method named Multi-view Action Selection Learning (MultiASL), which leverages action selection learning to enhance view fusion by selecting the most useful information from different viewpoints. The proposed method includes a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal Transformer video encoder to extract spatial and temporal features from multi-viewpoint videos. Action Selection Learning is employed at the frame-level, using pseudo ground-truth obtained from weak labels at the video-level, to identify the most relevant frames for action recognition. Experiments in a real-world office environment using the MM-Office dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing methods.

Similarly, continual learning aims to develop models that can generalize effectively and learn new tasks without forgetting the ones previously learned. The generalization goals of zero-shot and continual learning are closely aligned, however techniques from continual learning have not been applied to zero-shot action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on continual learning to address zero-shot action recognition. This model, which we call {\em Generative Iterative Learning} (GIL) uses a memory of synthesized features of past classes, and combines these synthetic features with real ones from novel classes. The memory is used to train a classification model, ensuring a balanced exposure to both old and new classes. Experiments demonstrate that {\em GIL} improves generalization in unseen classes, achieving a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot recognition across multiple benchmarks. Importantly, {\em GIL} also boosts performance in the more challenging generalized zero-shot setting, where models need to retain knowledge about classes seen before fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often fall short in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex, real-time environments where player movements are frequently occluded or involve intricate interactions. To overcome these challenges, we propose the EITNet model, a deep learning framework that combines EfficientDet for object detection, I3D for spatiotemporal feature extraction, and TimeSformer for temporal analysis, all integrated with IoT technology for seamless real-time data collection and processing. Our contributions include developing a robust architecture that improves recognition accuracy to 92\%, surpassing the baseline EfficientDet model's 87\%, and reducing loss to below 5.0 compared to EfficientDet's 9.0 over 50 epochs. Furthermore, the integration of IoT technology enhances real-time data processing, providing adaptive insights into player performance and strategy. The paper details the design and implementation of EITNet, experimental validation, and a comprehensive evaluation against existing models.

Tracking the motion and identifying the action being performed on a real time basis is necessary for critical security systems. In entertainment, especially gaming, the need for immediate responses for actions and gestures are paramount for the success of that system. We show that Motion History image has been a well established framework to capture the temporal and activity information in multi dimensional detail enabling various usecases including classification. We utilize MHI to produce sample data to train a classifier and demonstrate its effectiveness for action classification across six different activities in a single multi-action video. We analyze the classifier performance and identify usecases where MHI struggles to generate the appropriate activity image and discuss mechanisms and future work to overcome those limitations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 9 images | None |

Despite significant improvements brought by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), these models suffer performance declines when trained with discontinuous video frames, which is a frequent scenario in real-world settings. This decline primarily results from the loss of temporal continuity, which is crucial for understanding the semantics of human actions. To overcome this issue, we introduce the 4A (Action Animation-based Augmentation Approach) pipeline, which employs a series of sophisticated techniques: starting with 2D human pose estimation from RGB videos, followed by Quaternion-based Graph Convolution Network for joint orientation and trajectory prediction, and Dynamic Skeletal Interpolation for creating smoother, diversified actions using game engine technology. This innovative approach generates realistic animations in varied game environments, viewed from multiple viewpoints. In this way, our method effectively bridges the domain gap between virtual and real-world data. In experimental evaluations, the 4A pipeline achieves comparable or even superior performance to traditional training approaches using real-world data, while requiring only 10% of the original data volume. Additionally, our approach demonstrates enhanced performance on In-the-wild videos, marking a significant advancement in the field of action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI24, model and code are available at https://github.com/xingyu-song/4A</p></details> | None |

However, the majority of public benchmarks were constructed around activities of daily living and annotated at a rather coarse-grained level, which lacks diversity in domain-specific datasets, especially for rarely seen domains. In this paper, we introduced Human Stone Toolmaking Action Grammar (HSTAG), a meticulously annotated video dataset showcasing previously undocumented stone toolmaking behaviors, which can be used for investigating the applications of advanced artificial intelligence techniques in understanding a rapid succession of complex interactions between two hand-held objects. HSTAG consists of 18,739 video clips that record 4.5 hours of experts' activities in stone toolmaking. Its unique features include (i) brief action durations and frequent transitions, mirroring the rapid changes inherent in many motor behaviors; (ii) multiple angles of view and switches among multiple tools, increasing intra-class variability; (iii) unbalanced class distributions and high similarity among different action sequences, adding difficulty in capturing distinct patterns for each action. Several mainstream action recognition models are used to conduct experimental analysis, which showcases the challenges and uniqueness of HSTAG https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1697.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted by the 11th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)</p></details> | None |

In order to automatically recognize both the label and the temporal structure in sequence of human-object interaction, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN), which employs a pyramidal encoder-decoder architecture consisting of an attention based graph convolution network and a temporal pyramid pooling module for downsampling and upsampling interaction sequence on the temporal axis, respectively. The system represents the 2D or 3D spatial relation of human and objects from the detection results in video data as a graph. To learn the human-object relations, a new attention graph convolutional network is trained to extract condensed information from the graph representation. To segment action into sub-actions, a novel temporal pyramid pooling module is proposed, which upsamples compressed features back to the original time scale and classifies actions per frame. We explore various attention layers, namely spatial attention, temporal attention and channel attention, and combine different upsampling decoders to test the performance on action recognition and segmentation. We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets in the field of human-object interaction recognition, i.e. Bimanual Actions and IKEA Assembly datasets. We demonstrate that our classifier significantly improves both framewise action recognition and segmentation, e.g., F1 micro and F1@50 scores on Bimanual Actions dataset are improved by $4.3\%$ and $8.5\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, IROS 2022 conference</p></details> | None |

They offer promising advantages, namely a high dynamic range, low latency, and minimal motion blur. Modern computer vision algorithms often rely on artificial neural network approaches, which require image-like representations of the data and cannot fully exploit the characteristics of event data. We propose approaches to action recognition based on the Fourier Transform. The approaches are intended to recognize oscillating motion patterns commonly present in nature. In particular, we apply our approaches to a recent dataset of breeding penguins annotated for "ecstatic display", a behavior where the observed penguins flap their wings at a certain frequency. We find that our approaches are both simple and effective, producing slightly lower results than a deep neural network (DNN) while relying just on a tiny fraction of the parameters compared to the DNN (five orders of magnitude fewer parameters). They work well despite the uncontrolled, diverse data present in the dataset. We hope this work opens a new perspective on event-based processing and action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

However, we often fail to fully unleash their potential when adapting them for new concept understanding due to limited information on new classes. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework, AWT (Augment, Weight, then Transport). AWT comprises three key components: augmenting inputs with diverse visual perspectives and enriched class descriptions through image transformations and language models; dynamically weighting inputs based on the prediction entropy; and employing optimal transport to mine semantic correlations in the vision-language space. AWT can be seamlessly integrated into various VLMs, enhancing their zero-shot capabilities without additional training and facilitating few-shot learning through an integrated multimodal adapter module. We verify AWT in multiple challenging scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot image classification, zero-shot video action recognition, and out-of-distribution generalization. AWT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in each setting. In addition, our extensive studies further demonstrate AWT's effectiveness and adaptability across different VLMs, architectures, and scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

While several studies have recognized this advantage, most of them resort to full-parameter fine-tuning to make CLIP's visual encoder adapt to the FSAR data, which not only costs high computations but also overlooks the potential of the visual encoder to engage in temporal modeling and focus on targeted semantics directly. To tackle these issues, we introduce MA-FSAR, a framework that employs the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique to enhance the CLIP visual encoder in terms of action-related temporal and semantic representations. Our solution involves a Fine-grained Multimodal Adaptation, which is different from the previous attempts of PEFT in regular action recognition. Specifically, we first insert a Global Temporal Adaptation that only receives the class token to capture global motion cues efficiently. Then these outputs integrate with visual tokens to enhance local temporal dynamics by a Local Multimodal Adaptation, which incorporates text features unique to the FSAR support set branch to highlight fine-grained semantics related to actions. In addition to these token-level designs, we propose a prototype-level text-guided construction module to further enrich the temporal and semantic characteristics of video prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance in various tasks using minor trainable parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we introduce a novel approach to Human Action Recognition (HAR) based on skeleton and visual cues. Our method leverages a language model to guide the feature extraction process in the skeleton encoder. Specifically, we employ learnable prompts for the language model conditioned on the skeleton modality to optimize feature representation. Furthermore, we propose a fusion mechanism that combines dual-modality features using a salient fusion module, incorporating attention and transformer mechanisms to address the modalities' high dimensionality. This fusion process prioritizes informative video frames and body joints, enhancing the recognition accuracy of human actions. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset tailored for real-world robotic applications in construction sites, featuring visual, skeleton, and depth data modalities, named VolvoConstAct. This dataset serves to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning models to instruct autonomous construction machines for performing necessary tasks in the real world construction zones. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on our dataset as well as three widely used public datasets, NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D120 and NW-UCLA. Results reveal that our proposed method achieves promising performance across all datasets, demonstrating its robustness and potential for various applications.

| **[Sparse Covariance Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01669v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix of tabular data and achieve success in a variety of applications. However, the empirical covariance matrix on which the VNNs operate may contain many spurious correlations, making VNNs' performance inconsistent due to these noisy estimates and decreasing their computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we put forth Sparse coVariance Neural Networks (S-VNNs), a framework that applies sparsification techniques on the sample covariance matrix before convolution. When the true covariance matrix is sparse, we propose hard and soft thresholding to improve covariance estimation and reduce computational cost. Instead, when the true covariance is dense, we propose stochastic sparsification where data correlations are dropped in probability according to principled strategies. We show that S-VNNs are more stable than nominal VNNs as well as sparse principal component analysis. By analyzing the impact of sparsification on their behavior, we provide novel connections between S-VNN stability and data distribution. We support our theoretical findings with experimental results on various application scenarios, ranging from brain data to human action recognition, and show an improved task performance, stability, and computational efficiency of S-VNNs compared with nominal VNNs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Motion meets Attention: Video Motion Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03179v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos contain rich spatio-temporal information. Traditional methods for extracting motion, used in tasks such as action recognition, often rely on visual contents rather than precise motion features. This phenomenon is referred to as 'blind motion extraction' behavior, which proves inefficient in capturing motions of interest due to a lack of motion-guided cues. Recently, attention mechanisms have enhanced many computer vision tasks by effectively highlighting salient visual areas. Inspired by this, we propose a modified Sigmoid function with learnable slope and shift parameters as an attention mechanism to modulate motion signals from frame differencing maps. This approach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of motion-related video content. To ensure temporal continuity and smoothness of the attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation regularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving important ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention maps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of interest over time. These highlighted motions, termed video motion prompts, are subsequently used as inputs to the model instead of the original video frames. We formalize this process as a motion prompt layer and incorporate the regularization term into the loss function to learn better motion prompts. This layer serves as an adapter between the model and the video data, bridging the gap between traditional 'blind motion extraction' and the extraction of relevant motions of interest. We show that our lightweight, plug-and-play motion prompt layer seamlessly integrates into models like SlowFast, X3D, and TimeSformer, enhancing performance on benchmarks such as FineGym and MPII Cooking 2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 16th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2024)</p></details> | None |

To achieve these positive and negative pairs, existing weak/strong data augmentation methods have to randomly change the appearance of skeletons for indirectly pursuing semantic perturbations. However, such approaches have two limitations: i) solely perturbing appearance cannot well capture the intrinsic semantic information of skeletons, and ii) randomly perturbation may change the original positive/negative pairs to soft positive/negative ones. To address the above dilemma, we start the first attempt to explore an attack-based augmentation scheme that additionally brings in direct semantic perturbation, for constructing hard positive pairs and further assisting in constructing hard negative pairs. In particular, we propose a novel Attack-Augmentation Mixing-Contrastive skeletal representation learning (A$^2$MC) to contrast hard positive features and hard negative features for learning more robust skeleton representations. In A$^2$MC, Attack-Augmentation (Att-Aug) is designed to collaboratively perform targeted and untargeted perturbations of skeletons via attack and augmentation respectively, for generating high-quality hard positive features. Meanwhile, Positive-Negative Mixer (PNM) is presented to mix hard positive features and negative features for generating hard negative features, which are adopted for updating the mixed memory banks. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that A$^2$MC is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be accessible on A$^2$MC (https://github.com/1xbq1/A2MC).</p></details> |  | None |

These methods usually use multiple data streams (i.e., joint, motion, and bone) for ensemble learning, meanwhile, how to construct a discriminative feature space within a single stream and effectively aggregate the information from multiple streams remains an open problem. To this end, this paper first applies a new contrastive learning method called BYOL to learn from skeleton data, and then formulate SkeletonBYOL as a simple yet effective baseline for self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. Inspired by SkeletonBYOL, this paper further presents a Cross-Model and Cross-Stream (CMCS) framework. This framework combines Cross-Model Adversarial Learning (CMAL) and Cross-Stream Collaborative Learning (CSCL). Specifically, CMAL learns single-stream representation by cross-model adversarial loss to obtain more discriminative features. To aggregate and interact with multi-stream information, CSCL is designed by generating similarity pseudo label of ensemble learning as supervision and guiding feature generation for individual streams. Extensive experiments on three datasets verify the complementary properties between CMAL and CSCL and also verify that the proposed method can achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods using various evaluation protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Levigty/CMCS .

However, the paradigm of "image pre-training followed by video fine-tuning" for high-dimensional video data inevitably poses significant performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, in the medical domain, many surgical video tasks encounter additional challenges posed by the limited availability of video data and the necessity for comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling. Recently, Parameter-Efficient Image-to-Video Transfer Learning has emerged as an efficient and effective paradigm for video action recognition tasks, which employs image-level pre-trained models with promising feature transferability and involves cross-modality temporal modeling with minimal fine-tuning. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and generalizability of this paradigm within intricate surgical domain remain unexplored. In this paper, we delve into a novel problem of efficiently adapting image-level pre-trained models to specialize in fine-grained surgical phase recognition, termed as Parameter-Efficient Image-to-Surgical-Video Transfer Learning. Firstly, we develop a parameter-efficient transfer learning benchmark SurgPETL for surgical phase recognition, and conduct extensive experiments with three advanced methods based on ViTs of two distinct scales pre-trained on five large-scale natural and medical datasets. Then, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Adaptation module, integrating a standard spatial adapter with a novel temporal adapter to capture detailed spatial features and establish connections across temporal sequences for robust spatial-temporal modeling.

Unlike approaches that learn a fixed representation of the output classes, we generate at inference time a model tailored to a query classification task. To generate task-based zero-shot classifiers, we train a hypernetwork that receives class descriptions and outputs a multi-class model. The hypernetwork is designed to be equivariant with respect to the set of descriptions and the classification layer, thus obeying the symmetries of the problem and improving generalization. Our approach generates non-linear classifiers, handles rich textual descriptions, and may be adapted to produce lightweight models efficient enough for on-device applications. We evaluate this approach in a series of zero-shot classification tasks, for image, point-cloud, and action recognition, using a range of text descriptions: From single words to rich descriptions. Our results demonstrate strong improvements over previous approaches, showing that zero-shot learning can be applied with little training data. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis with foundational vision and language models, demonstrating that they struggle to generalize when describing what attributes the class lacks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, previous works primarily relied on a single masking criterion, resulting in the model overfitting specific features and overlooking other effective information. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchy and attention guided cross-masking framework (HA-CM) that applies masking to skeleton sequences from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, in spatial graphs, we utilize hyperbolic space to maintain joint distinctions and effectively preserve the hierarchical structure of high-dimensional skeletons, employing joint hierarchy as the masking criterion. In temporal flows, we substitute traditional distance metrics with the global attention of joints for masking, addressing the convergence of distances in high-dimensional space and the lack of a global perspective. Additionally, we incorporate cross-contrast loss based on the cross-masking framework into the loss function to enhance the model's learning of instance-level features. HA-CM shows efficiency and universality on three public large-scale datasets, NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD.

| **[Path-adaptive Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for Event-based Recognition with Arbitrary Duration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16953v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution. To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies. To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies. Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences. To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames. On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features. This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies. Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features. Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | First version | None |
| **[How Effective are Self-Supervised Models for Contact Identification in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00498v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of video content via Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models has unveiled a dynamic field of study, emphasizing both the complex challenges and unique opportunities inherent in this area. Despite the growing body of research, the ability of SSL models to detect physical contacts in videos remains largely unexplored, particularly the effectiveness of methods such as downstream supervision with linear probing or full fine-tuning. This work aims to bridge this gap by employing eight different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based video SSL models to identify instances of physical contact within video sequences specifically. The Something-Something v2 (SSv2) and Epic-Kitchen (EK-100) datasets were chosen for evaluating these approaches due to the promising results on UCF101 and HMDB51, coupled with their limited prior assessment on SSv2 and EK-100. Additionally, these datasets feature diverse environments and scenarios, essential for testing the robustness and accuracy of video-based models. This approach not only examines the effectiveness of each model in recognizing physical contacts but also explores the performance in the action recognition downstream task. By doing so, valuable insights into the adaptability of SSL models in interpreting complex, dynamic visual information are contributed.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Dual Visual-Text Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14336v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot action recognition, which addresses the issue of scalability and generalization in action recognition and allows the models to adapt to new and unseen actions dynamically, is an important research topic in computer vision communities. The key to zero-shot action recognition lies in aligning visual features with semantic vectors representing action categories. Most existing methods either directly project visual features onto the semantic space of text category or learn a shared embedding space between the two modalities. However, a direct projection cannot accurately align the two modalities, and learning robust and discriminative embedding space between visual and text representations is often difficult. To address these issues, we introduce Dual Visual-Text Alignment (DVTA) for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition. The DVTA consists of two alignment modules-Direct Alignment (DA) and Augmented Alignment (AA)-along with a designed Semantic Description Enhancement (SDE). The DA module maps the skeleton features to the semantic space through a specially designed visual projector, followed by the SDE, which is based on cross-attention to enhance the connection between skeleton and text, thereby reducing the gap between modalities. The AA module further strengthens the learning of the embedding space by utilizing deep metric learning to learn the similarity between skeleton and text. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances on several popular zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Egocentric zone-aware action recognition across environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14205v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human activities exhibit a strong correlation between actions and the places where these are performed, such as washing something at a sink. More specifically, in daily living environments we may identify particular locations, hereinafter named activity-centric zones, which may afford a set of homogeneous actions. Their knowledge can serve as a prior to favor vision models to recognize human activities. However, the appearance of these zones is scene-specific, limiting the transferability of this prior information to unfamiliar areas and domains. This problem is particularly relevant in egocentric vision, where the environment takes up most of the image, making it even more difficult to separate the action from the context. In this paper, we discuss the importance of decoupling the domain-specific appearance of activity-centric zones from their universal, domain-agnostic representations, and show how the latter can improve the cross-domain transferability of Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR) models. We validate our solution on the EPIC-Kitchens-100 and Argo1M datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://gabrielegoletto.github.io/EgoZAR/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://gabrielegoletto.github.io/EgoZAR) |

The dataset comes with a) full-body ground-truth motion; b) multiple multimodal egocentric data from Project Aria devices with videos, eye tracking, IMUs and etc; and c) a third-person perspective by an additional observer. All devices are precisely synchronized and localized in on metric 3D world. We derive hierarchical protocol to add in-context language descriptions of human motion, from fine-grain motion narration, to simplified atomic action and high-level activity summarization. To the best of our knowledge, Nymeria dataset is the world's largest collection of human motion in the wild; first of its kind to provide synchronized and localized multi-device multimodal egocentric data; and the world's largest motion-language dataset. It provides 300 hours of daily activities from 264 participants across 50 locations, total travelling distance over 399Km. The language descriptions contain 301.5K sentences in 8.64M words from a vocabulary size of 6545. To demonstrate the potential of the dataset, we evaluate several SOTA algorithms for egocentric body tracking, motion synthesis, and action recognition.

| **[Interpretable Action Recognition on Hard to Classify Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13091v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a human-like interpretable model of video understanding. Humans recognise complex activities in video by recognising critical spatio-temporal relations among explicitly recognised objects and parts, for example, an object entering the aperture of a container. To mimic this we build on a model which uses positions of objects and hands, and their motions, to recognise the activity taking place. To improve this model we focussed on three of the most confused classes (for this model) and identified that the lack of 3D information was the major problem. To address this we extended our basic model by adding 3D awareness in two ways: (1) A state-of-the-art object detection model was fine-tuned to determine the difference between "Container" and "NotContainer" in order to integrate object shape information into the existing object features. (2) A state-of-the-art depth estimation model was used to extract depth values for individual objects and calculate depth relations to expand the existing relations used our interpretable model. These 3D extensions to our basic model were evaluated on a subset of three superficially similar "Putting" actions from the Something-Something-v2 dataset. The results showed that the container detector did not improve performance, but the addition of depth relations made a significant improvement to performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, This manuscript has been accepted at the Human-inspired Computer Vision (HCV) ECCV 2024 Workshop. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2107.05319</p></details> | None |
| **[Modelling Spatio-Temporal Interactions For Compositional Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02673v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans have the natural ability to recognize actions even if the objects involved in the action or the background are changed. Humans can abstract away the action from the appearance of the objects which is referred to as compositionality of actions. We focus on this compositional aspect of action recognition to impart human-like generalization abilities to video action-recognition models. First, we propose an interaction model that captures both fine-grained and long-range interactions between hands and objects. Frame-wise hand-object interactions capture fine-grained movements, while long-range interactions capture broader context and disambiguate actions across time. Second, in order to provide additional contextual cues to differentiate similar actions, we infuse the interaction tokens with global motion information from video tokens. The final global motion refined interaction tokens are used for compositional action recognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach on the compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-art result outperforming recent object-centric methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, they struggle with global context modeling due to their data-independent matrices. The Mamba model addressed this with data-dependent variants via the S6 selective-scan algorithm, enhancing context modeling, especially for long sequences. However, Mamba-based architectures are difficult to scale with respect to the number of parameters, which is a major limitation for vision applications. This paper addresses the scalability issue of large SSMs for image classification and action recognition without requiring additional techniques like knowledge distillation. We analyze the distinct characteristics of Mamba-based and Attention-based models, proposing a Mamba-Attention interleaved architecture that enhances scalability, robustness, and performance. We demonstrate that the stable and efficient interleaved architecture resolves the scalability issue of Mamba-based architectures for images and videos and increases robustness to common artifacts like JPEG compression. Our thorough evaluation on the ImageNet-1K, Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2 benchmarks demonstrates that our approach improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art Mamba-based architectures by up to $+1.7$.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Quantifying and Learning Static vs. Dynamic Information in Deep Spatiotemporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01783v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is limited understanding of the information captured by deep spatiotemporal models in their intermediate representations. For example, while evidence suggests that action recognition algorithms are heavily influenced by visual appearance in single frames, no quantitative methodology exists for evaluating such static bias in the latent representation compared to bias toward dynamics. We tackle this challenge by proposing an approach for quantifying the static and dynamic biases of any spatiotemporal model, and apply our approach to three tasks, action recognition, automatic video object segmentation (AVOS) and video instance segmentation (VIS). Our key findings are: (i) Most examined models are biased toward static information. (ii) Some datasets that are assumed to be biased toward dynamics are actually biased toward static information. (iii) Individual channels in an architecture can be biased toward static, dynamic or a combination of the two. (iv) Most models converge to their culminating biases in the first half of training. We then explore how these biases affect performance on dynamically biased datasets. For action recognition, we propose StaticDropout, a semantically guided dropout that debiases a model from static information toward dynamics. For AVOS, we design a better combination of fusion and cross connection layers compared with previous architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>TPAMI...</summary><p>TPAMI 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2206.02846</p></details> | None |

| **[Vision-Language Meets the Skeleton: Progressively Distillation with Cross-Modal Knowledge for 3D Action Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20606v2)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action representation learning aims to interpret and understand human behaviors by encoding the skeleton sequences, which can be categorized into two primary training paradigms: supervised learning and self-supervised learning. However, the former one-hot classification requires labor-intensive predefined action categories annotations, while the latter involves skeleton transformations (e.g., cropping) in the pretext tasks that may impair the skeleton structure. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel skeleton-based training framework (C$^2$VL) based on Cross-modal Contrastive learning that uses the progressive distillation to learn task-agnostic human skeleton action representation from the Vision-Language knowledge prompts. Specifically, we establish the vision-language action concept space through vision-language knowledge prompts generated by pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs), which enrich the fine-grained details that the skeleton action space lacks. Moreover, we propose the intra-modal self-similarity and inter-modal cross-consistency softened targets in the cross-modal representation learning process to progressively control and guide the degree of pulling vision-language knowledge prompts and corresponding skeletons closer. These soft instance discrimination and self-knowledge distillation strategies contribute to the learning of better skeleton-based action representations from the noisy skeleton-vision-language pairs. During the inference phase, our method requires only the skeleton data as the input for action recognition and no longer for vision-language prompts. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.

However, existing point cloud sequence modeling methods cannot adequately balance the precision of limb micro-movements with the integrity of posture macro-structure, leading to the loss of crucial information cues in action inference. To overcome this limitation, we introduce D-Hyperpoint, a novel data type generated through a D-Hyperpoint Embedding module. D-Hyperpoint encapsulates both regional-momentary motion and global-static posture, effectively summarizing the unit human action at each moment. In addition, we present a D-Hyperpoint KANsMixer module, which is recursively applied to nested groupings of D-Hyperpoints to learn the action discrimination information and creatively integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to enhance spatio-temporal interaction within D-Hyperpoints. Finally, we propose KAN-HyperpointNet, a spatio-temporal decoupled network architecture for 3D action recognition. Extensive experiments on two public datasets: MSR Action3D and NTU-RGB+D 60, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, third-person view HOI has received less attention, especially in terms of datasets. Most third-person view datasets are curated for action recognition tasks and feature pre-segmented clips of high-level daily activities, leaving a gap for in-the-wild datasets. To address this gap, we propose ChildPlay-Hand, a novel dataset that includes person and object bounding boxes, as well as manipulation actions. ChildPlay-Hand is unique in: (1) providing per-hand annotations; (2) featuring videos in uncontrolled settings with natural interactions, involving both adults and children; (3) including gaze labels from the ChildPlay-Gaze dataset for joint modeling of manipulations and gaze. The manipulation actions cover the main stages of an HOI cycle, such as grasping, holding or operating, and different types of releasing. To illustrate the interest of the dataset, we study two tasks: object in hand detection (OiH), i.e. if a person has an object in their hand, and manipulation stages (ManiS), which is more fine-grained and targets the main stages of manipulation. We benchmark various spatio-temporal and segmentation networks, exploring body vs. hand-region information and comparing pose and RGB modalities. Our findings suggest that ChildPlay-Hand is a challenging new benchmark for modeling HOI in the wild.</p></details> |  | None |

The robustness of these techniques, however, remains a concern, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks that have been proven to deceive state-of-the-art deep neural networks in many domains. Surprisingly, the robustness of scene flow networks against such attacks has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this problem, the proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing adversarial white-box attacks specifically tailored for scene flow networks. Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples obtain up to 33.7 relative degradation in average end-point error on the KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets. The study also reveals the significant impact that attacks targeting point clouds in only one dimension or color channel have on average end-point error. Analyzing the success and failure of these attacks on the scene flow networks and their 2D optical flow network variants shows a higher vulnerability for the optical flow networks.

| **[Data Collection-free Masked Video Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06665v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training video transformers generally requires a large amount of data, presenting significant challenges in terms of data collection costs and concerns related to privacy, licensing, and inherent biases. Synthesizing data is one of the promising ways to solve these issues, yet pre-training solely on synthetic data has its own challenges. In this paper, we introduce an effective self-supervised learning framework for videos that leverages readily available and less costly static images. Specifically, we define the Pseudo Motion Generator (PMG) module that recursively applies image transformations to generate pseudo-motion videos from images. These pseudo-motion videos are then leveraged in masked video modeling. Our approach is applicable to synthetic images as well, thus entirely freeing video pre-training from data collection costs and other concerns in real data. Through experiments in action recognition tasks, we demonstrate that this framework allows effective learning of spatio-temporal features through pseudo-motion videos, significantly improving over existing methods which also use static images and partially outperforming those using both real and synthetic videos. These results uncover fragments of what video transformers learn through masked video modeling.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |

Therefore, unsupervised representation learning is of prime importance to leverage unlabeled skeleton data. In this work, we investigate unsupervised representation learning for skeleton action recognition. For this purpose, we designed a lightweight convolutional transformer framework, named ReL-SAR, exploiting the complementarity of convolutional and attention layers for jointly modeling spatial and temporal cues in skeleton sequences. We also use a Selection-Permutation strategy for skeleton joints to ensure more informative descriptions from skeletal data. Finally, we capitalize on Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) to learn robust representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data. We achieved very competitive results on limited-size datasets: MCAD, IXMAS, JHMDB, and NW-UCLA, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency.

ViDiDi is a simple and data-efficient strategy, readily applicable to existing self-supervised video representation learning frameworks based on instance discrimination. At its core, ViDiDi observes different aspects of a video through various orders of temporal derivatives of its frame sequence. These derivatives, along with the original frames, support the Taylor series expansion of the underlying continuous dynamics at discrete times, where higher-order derivatives emphasize higher-order motion features. ViDiDi learns a single neural network that encodes a video and its temporal derivatives into consistent embeddings following a balanced alternating learning algorithm. By learning consistent representations for original frames and derivatives, the encoder is steered to emphasize motion features over static backgrounds and uncover the hidden dynamics in original frames. Hence, video representations are better separated by dynamic features. We integrate ViDiDi into existing instance discrimination frameworks (VICReg, BYOL, and SimCLR) for pretraining on UCF101 or Kinetics and test on standard benchmarks including video retrieval, action recognition, and action detection. The performances are enhanced by a significant margin without the need for large models or extensive datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

A powerful model is expected to be capable of capturing region-object correspondences and recognizing scene changes in a video clip, reflecting spatial and temporal granularity, respectively. To strengthen model's understanding into such fine-grained details, we propose a simple yet effective video-language modeling framework, S-ViLM, by exploiting the intrinsic structures of these two modalities. It includes two novel designs, inter-clip spatial grounding and intra-clip temporal grouping, to promote learning region-object alignment and temporal-aware features, simultaneously. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that S-ViLM performs favorably against existing approaches in learning more expressive representations.

Prior works on video alignment have focused on using global temporal ordering across sequence pairs, whereas our loss encourages identifying the best-scoring subsequence alignment. LAC uses the differentiable Smith-Waterman (SW) affine method, which features a flexible parameterization learned through the training phase, enabling the model to adjust the temporal gap penalty length dynamically.

| **[DEVIAS: Learning Disentangled Video Representations of Action and Scene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00826v3)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video recognition models often learn scene-biased action representation due to the spurious correlation between actions and scenes in the training data. Such models show poor performance when the test data consists of videos with unseen action-scene combinations. Although scene-debiased action recognition models might address the issue, they often overlook valuable scene information in the data. To address this challenge, we propose to learn DisEntangled VIdeo representations of Action and Scene (DEVIAS), for more holistic video understanding. We propose an encoder-decoder architecture to learn disentangled action and scene representations with a single model. The architecture consists of a disentangling encoder (DE), an action mask decoder (AMD), and a prediction head. The key to achieving the disentanglement is employing both DE and AMD during training time. The DE uses the slot attention mechanism to learn disentangled action and scene representations. For further disentanglement, an AMD learns to predict action masks, given an action slot. With the resulting disentangled representations, we can achieve robust performance across diverse scenarios, including both seen and unseen action-scene combinations. We rigorously validate the proposed method on the UCF-101, Kinetics-400, and HVU datasets for the seen, and the SCUBA, HAT, and HVU datasets for unseen action-scene combination scenarios.

| **[Boosting Adversarial Transferability for Skeleton-based Action Recognition via Exploring the Model Posterior Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08572v2)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeletal motion plays a pivotal role in human activity recognition (HAR). Recently, attack methods have been proposed to identify the universal vulnerability of skeleton-based HAR(S-HAR). However, the research of adversarial transferability on S-HAR is largely missing. More importantly, existing attacks all struggle in transfer across unknown S-HAR models. We observed that the key reason is that the loss landscape of the action recognizers is rugged and sharp. Given the established correlation in prior studies~\cite{qin2022boosting,wu2020towards} between loss landscape and adversarial transferability, we assume and empirically validate that smoothing the loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability on S-HAR. This is achieved by proposing a new post-train Dual Bayesian strategy, which can effectively explore the model posterior space for a collection of surrogates without the need for re-training. Furthermore, to craft adversarial examples along the motion manifold, we incorporate the attack gradient with information of the motion dynamics in a Bayesian manner. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, e.g. HDM05 and NTU 60, the average transfer success rate can reach as high as 35.9\% and 45.5\% respectively. In comparison, current state-of-the-art skeletal attacks achieve only 3.6\% and 9.8\%. The high adversarial transferability remains consistent across various surrogate, victim, and even defense models. Through a comprehensive analysis of the results, we provide insights on what surrogates are more likely to exhibit transferability, to shed light on future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have submitted a new version of our work at arXiv:2409.02483.

Moreover, handling spatio-temporal data using deep $3$D transformers for this can introduce significant computational complexity. In this paper, our objective is to address video action recognition in a semi-supervised setting by leveraging only a handful of labeled videos along with a collection of unlabeled videos in a compute efficient manner. Specifically, we rearrange multiple frames from the input videos in row-column form to construct super images. Subsequently, we capitalize on the vast pool of unlabeled samples and employ contrastive learning on the encoded super images. Our proposed approach employs two pathways to generate representations for temporally augmented super images originating from the same video. Specifically, we utilize a 2D image-transformer to generate representations and apply a contrastive loss function to minimize the similarity between representations from different videos while maximizing the representations of identical videos. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches for semi-supervised action recognition across various benchmark datasets, all while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> | None |

| **[ReSpike: Residual Frames-based Hybrid Spiking Neural Networks for Efficient Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01564v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a compelling, energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for static image tasks such as image classification and segmentation. However, in the more complex video classification domain, SNN-based methods fall considerably short of ANN-based benchmarks due to the challenges in processing dense frame sequences. To bridge this gap, we propose ReSpike, a hybrid framework that synergizes the strengths of ANNs and SNNs to tackle action recognition tasks with high accuracy and low energy cost. By decomposing film clips into spatial and temporal components, i.e., RGB image Key Frames and event-like Residual Frames, ReSpike leverages ANN for learning spatial information and SNN for learning temporal information. In addition, we propose a multi-scale cross-attention mechanism for effective feature fusion. Compared to state-of-the-art SNN baselines, our ReSpike hybrid architecture demonstrates significant performance improvements (e.g., >30% absolute accuracy improvement on HMDB-51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400). Furthermore, ReSpike achieves comparable performance with prior ANN approaches while bringing better accuracy-energy tradeoff.</p></details> |  | None |

Although fine-grained actions are more costly to annotate, existing semi-supervised action recognition has mainly focused on coarse-grained action recognition. Since fine-grained actions are more challenging due to the absence of scene bias, classifying these actions requires an understanding of action-phases. Hence, existing coarse-grained semi-supervised methods do not work effectively. In this work, we for the first time thoroughly investigate semi-supervised fine-grained action recognition (FGAR). We observe that alignment distances like dynamic time warping (DTW) provide a suitable action-phase-aware measure for comparing fine-grained actions, a concept previously unexploited in FGAR. However, since regular DTW distance is pairwise and assumes strict alignment between pairs, it is not directly suitable for classifying fine-grained actions. To utilize such alignment distances in a limited-label setting, we propose an Alignability-Verification-based Metric learning technique to effectively discriminate between fine-grained action pairs. Our learnable alignability score provides a better phase-aware measure, which we use to refine the pseudo-labels of the primary video encoder. Our collaborative pseudo-labeling-based framework `\textit{FinePseudo}' significantly outperforms prior methods on four fine-grained action recognition datasets: Diving48, FineGym99, FineGym288, and FineDiving, and shows improvement on existing coarse-grained datasets: Kinetics400 and Something-SomethingV2. We also demonstrate the robustness of our collaborative pseudo-labeling in handling novel unlabeled classes in open-world semi-supervised setups.

| **[Event Voxel Set Transformer for Spatiotemporal Representation Learning on Event Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03856v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are neuromorphic vision sensors that record a scene as sparse and asynchronous event streams. Most event-based methods project events into dense frames and process them using conventional vision models, resulting in high computational complexity. A recent trend is to develop point-based networks that achieve efficient event processing by learning sparse representations. However, existing works may lack robust local information aggregators and effective feature interaction operations, thus limiting their modeling capabilities. To this end, we propose an attention-aware model named Event Voxel Set Transformer (EVSTr) for efficient spatiotemporal representation learning on event streams. It first converts the event stream into voxel sets and then hierarchically aggregates voxel features to obtain robust representations. The core of EVSTr is an event voxel transformer encoder that consists of two well-designed components, including the Multi-Scale Neighbor Embedding Layer (MNEL) for local information aggregation and the Voxel Self-Attention Layer (VSAL) for global feature interaction. Enabling the network to incorporate a long-range temporal structure, we introduce a segment modeling strategy (S$^{2}$TM) to learn motion patterns from a sequence of segmented voxel sets. The proposed model is evaluated on two recognition tasks, including object classification and action recognition. To provide a convincing model evaluation, we present a new event-based action recognition dataset (NeuroHAR) recorded in challenging scenarios. Comprehensive experiments show that EVSTr achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low model complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT)</p></details> | None |
| **[Fisher Information guided Purification against Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00863v1)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies on backdoor attacks in recent years suggest that an adversary can compromise the integrity of a deep neural network (DNN) by manipulating a small set of training samples. Our analysis shows that such manipulation can make the backdoor model converge to a bad local minima, i.e., sharper minima as compared to a benign model. Intuitively, the backdoor can be purified by re-optimizing the model to smoother minima. However, a na\"ive adoption of any optimization targeting smoother minima can lead to sub-optimal purification techniques hampering the clean test accuracy. Hence, to effectively obtain such re-optimization, inspired by our novel perspective establishing the connection between backdoor removal and loss smoothness, we propose Fisher Information guided Purification (FIP), a novel backdoor purification framework. Proposed FIP consists of a couple of novel regularizers that aid the model in suppressing the backdoor effects and retaining the acquired knowledge of clean data distribution throughout the backdoor removal procedure through exploiting the knowledge of Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). In addition, we introduce an efficient variant of FIP, dubbed as Fast FIP, which reduces the number of tunable parameters significantly and obtains an impressive runtime gain of almost $5\times$. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on a wide range of backdoor defense benchmarks: 5 different tasks -- Image Recognition, Object Detection, Video Action Recognition, 3D point Cloud, Language Generation; 11 different datasets including ImageNet, PASCAL VOC, UCF101; diverse model architectures spanning both CNN and vision transformer; 14 different backdoor attacks, e.g., Dynamic, WaNet, LIRA, ISSBA, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CCS 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.17441</p></details> | None |

While these models excel in zero-shot image tasks, their application to zero-shot video action recognition (ZSVAR) remains challenging due to the dynamic and temporal nature of actions. Existing methods for ZS-VAR typically require extensive training on specific datasets, which can be resource-intensive and may introduce domain biases. In this work, we propose Text-Enhanced Action Recognition (TEAR), a simple approach to ZS-VAR that is training-free and does not require the availability of training data or extensive computational resources. Drawing inspiration from recent findings in vision and language literature, we utilize action descriptors for decomposition and contextual information to enhance zero-shot action recognition. Through experiments on UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics-600 datasets, we showcase the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed approach in addressing the challenges of ZS-VAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ICPR 2024</p></details> | None |

Our approach is designed to predict the action of each agent by helping the models focus on the descriptions or instructions associated with actions in the input videos for aerial/robot visual perception. Our formulation supports various prompts, including learnable prompts, auxiliary visual information, and large vision models to improve the recognition performance. We present a soft conditional prompt method that learns to dynamically generate prompts from a pool of prompt experts under different video inputs. By sharing the same objective with the task, our proposed SCP can optimize prompts that guide the model's predictions while explicitly learning input-invariant (prompt experts pool) and input-specific (data-dependent) prompt knowledge. In practice, we observe a 3.17-10.2% accuracy improvement on the aerial video datasets (Okutama, NECDrone), which consist of scenes with single-agent and multi-agent actions. We further evaluate our approach on ground camera videos to verify the effectiveness and generalization and achieve a 1.0-3.6% improvement on dataset SSV2. We integrate our method into the ROS2 as well.</p></details> | IROS2024 | None |

With the limitation in the scale of egocentric data collection, learning robust deep learning-based action recognition models remains difficult. Transferring knowledge learned from the large-scale exocentric data to the egocentric data is challenging due to the difference in videos across views. Our work introduces a novel cross-view learning approach to action recognition (CVAR) that effectively transfers knowledge from the exocentric to the selfish view. First, we present a novel geometric-based constraint into the self-attention mechanism in Transformer based on analyzing the camera positions between two views. Then, we propose a new cross-view self-attention loss learned on unpaired cross-view data to enforce the self-attention mechanism learning to transfer knowledge across views. Finally, to further improve the performance of our cross-view learning approach, we present the metrics to measure the correlations in videos and attention maps effectively. Experimental results on standard egocentric action recognition benchmarks, i.e., Charades-Ego, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EPIC-Kitchens-100, have shown our approach's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Different from the image domain, skeleton data possesses sparser spatial structures and diverse representation forms, with the absence of background clues and the additional temporal dimension, presenting new challenges for spatial-temporal motion pretext task design. Recently, many endeavors have been made for skeleton-based SSL, achieving remarkable progress. However, a systematic and thorough review is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct, for the first time, a comprehensive survey on self-supervised skeleton-based action representation learning. Following the taxonomy of context-based, generative learning, and contrastive learning approaches, we make a thorough review and benchmark of existing works and shed light on the future possible directions. Remarkably, our investigation demonstrates that most SSL works rely on the single paradigm, learning representations of a single level, and are evaluated on the action recognition task solely, which leaves the generalization power of skeleton SSL models under-explored. To this end, a novel and effective SSL method for skeleton is further proposed, which integrates versatile representation learning objectives of different granularity, substantially boosting the generalization capacity for multiple skeleton downstream tasks. Extensive experiments under three large-scale datasets demonstrate our method achieves superior generalization performance on various downstream tasks, including recognition, retrieval, detection, and few-shot learning.</p></details> |  | None |

It helps to carry out a series of downstream tasks, like understanding human behaviors. Due to the complexity of human behaviors, many highly valuable behaviors are not yet encompassed within the available datasets for HAR, e.g., human habitual behaviors (HHBs). HHBs hold significant importance for analyzing a person's personality, habits, and psychological changes. To solve these problems, in this work, we build a novel video dataset to demonstrate various HHBs. These behaviors in the proposed dataset are able to reflect internal mental states and specific emotions of the characters, e.g., crossing arms suggests to shield oneself from perceived threats. The dataset contains 30 categories of habitual behaviors including more than 300,000 frames and 6,899 action instances. Since these behaviors usually appear at small local parts of human action videos, it is difficult for existing action recognition methods to handle these local features. Therefore, we also propose a two-stream model using both human skeletons and RGB appearances. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has much better performance in action recognition than the existing methods on the proposed dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike language or image foundation models, many video foundation models are evaluated with differing parameters (such as sampling rate, number of frames, pretraining steps, etc.), making fair and robust comparisons challenging. Therefore, we present a carefully designed evaluation framework for measuring two core capabilities of video comprehension: appearance and motion understanding. Our findings reveal that existing video foundation models, whether text-supervised like UMT or InternVideo2, or self-supervised like V-JEPA, exhibit limitations in at least one of these capabilities. As an alternative, we introduce TWLV-I, a new video foundation model that constructs robust visual representations for both motion- and appearance-based videos. Based on the average top-1 accuracy of linear probing on five action recognition benchmarks, pretrained only on publicly accessible datasets, our model shows a 4.6%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-L) and a 7.7%p improvement compared to UMT (ViT-L). Even when compared to much larger models, our model demonstrates a 7.2%p improvement compared to DFN (ViT-H), a 2.7%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-H) and a 2.8%p improvement compared to InternVideo2 (ViT-g).

Different from the existing fine-tuning approaches that capture temporal information by exploring the relationships among all the frames, our perceiver-based adapter recurrently captures the sequential dynamics alongside the timeline, which could perceive the order change. To obtain the discriminative representations for each class, we extend a textual corpus for each class derived from the large language models (LLMs) and enrich the visual prototypes by integrating the contextual semantic information. Besides, We introduce an unbalanced optimal transport strategy for feature matching that mitigates the impact of class-unrelated features, thereby facilitating more effective decision-making. Experimental results on five FSAR datasets demonstrate that our method set a new benchmark, beating the second-best competitors with large margins.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

This inspires researchers in transferring the knowledge from these large pre-trained models to other task-specific models, e.g., Video Action Recognition (VAR) models, via particularly leveraging side networks to enhance the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, current transferring approaches in VAR tend to directly transfer the frozen knowledge from large pre-trained models to action recognition networks with minimal cost, instead of exploiting the temporal modeling capabilities of the action recognition models themselves. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Temporal Difference Side Network (TDS-CLIP) to balance knowledge transferring and temporal modeling, avoiding backpropagation in frozen parameter models. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Difference Adapter (TD-Adapter), which can effectively capture local temporal differences in motion features to strengthen the model's global temporal modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we designed a Side Motion Enhancement Adapter (SME-Adapter) to guide the proposed side network in efficiently learning the rich motion information in videos, thereby improving the side network's ability to capture and learn motion information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including Something-Something V1\&V2, and Kinetics-400.

The resulting depth maps are then used as segmentation masks for the RGB frames. Experimental results on H2O Dataset confirm the high accuracy of the estimated pose with our method in an action recognition task. The 3D hand pose, together with information from object detection, is processed by a transformer-based action recognition network, resulting in an accuracy of 91.73%, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods. Estimations of 3D hand pose result in competitive performance with existing methods with a mean pose error of 28.66 mm.

However, in real-world applications, RGB cameras encounter numerous challenges, including light conditions, fast motion, and privacy concerns. Consequently, bio-inspired event cameras have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages of low energy consumption, high dynamic range, etc. Nevertheless, most existing event-based HAR datasets are low resolution ($346 \times 260$). In this paper, we propose a large-scale, high-definition ($1280 \times 800$) human action recognition dataset based on the CeleX-V event camera, termed CeleX-HAR. It encompasses 150 commonly occurring action categories, comprising a total of 124,625 video sequences. Various factors such as multi-view, illumination, action speed, and occlusion are considered when recording these data. To build a more comprehensive benchmark dataset, we report over 20 mainstream HAR models for future works to compare. In addition, we also propose a novel Mamba vision backbone network for event stream based HAR, termed EVMamba, which equips the spatial plane multi-directional scanning and novel voxel temporal scanning mechanism. By encoding and mining the spatio-temporal information of event streams, our EVMamba has achieved favorable results across multiple datasets. Both the dataset and source code will be released on \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/CeleX-HAR}</p></details> | In Peer Review | None |
| **[Joint Temporal Pooling for Improving Skeleton-based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09356v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In skeleton-based human action recognition, temporal pooling is a critical step for capturing spatiotemporal relationship of joint dynamics. Conventional pooling methods overlook the preservation of motion information and treat each frame equally. However, in an action sequence, only a few segments of frames carry discriminative information related to the action. This paper presents a novel Joint Motion Adaptive Temporal Pooling (JMAP) method for improving skeleton-based action recognition. Two variants of JMAP, frame-wise pooling and joint-wise pooling, are introduced. The efficacy of JMAP has been validated through experiments on the popular NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this research, we introduce a novel methodology adept at classifying three-dimensional human actions, leveraging them to coordinate on-field with a UAV. Utilizing a stereo camera, we derive both RGB and depth data, subsequently extracting three-dimensional human poses from the continuous video feed. This data is then processed through our proposed k-nearest neighbour classifier, the results of which dictate the behaviour of the UAV. It also includes mechanisms ensuring the robot perpetually maintains the human within its visual purview, adeptly tracking user movements. We subjected our approach to rigorous testing involving multiple tests with real robots. The ensuing results, coupled with comprehensive analysis, underscore the efficacy and inherent advantages of our proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO) 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Flatten: Video Action Recognition is an Image Classification task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09220v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, video action recognition, as a fundamental task in the field of video understanding, has been deeply explored by numerous researchers.Most traditional video action recognition methods typically involve converting videos into three-dimensional data that encapsulates both spatial and temporal information, subsequently leveraging prevalent image understanding models to model and analyze these data. However,these methods have significant drawbacks. Firstly, when delving into video action recognition tasks, image understanding models often need to be adapted accordingly in terms of model architecture and preprocessing for these spatiotemporal tasks; Secondly, dealing with high-dimensional data often poses greater challenges and incurs higher time costs compared to its lower-dimensional counterparts.To bridge the gap between image-understanding and video-understanding tasks while simplifying the complexity of video comprehension, we introduce a novel video representation architecture, Flatten, which serves as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated into any image-understanding network for efficient and effective 3D temporal data modeling.Specifically, by applying specific flattening operations (e.g., row-major transform), 3D spatiotemporal data is transformed into 2D spatial information, and then ordinary image understanding models are used to capture temporal dynamic and spatial semantic information, which in turn accomplishes effective and efficient video action recognition. Extensive experiments on commonly used datasets (Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and HMDB-51) and three classical image classification models (Uniformer, SwinV2, and ResNet), have demonstrated that embedding Flatten provides a significant performance improvements over original model.</p></details> | 13pages, 6figures | None |

Unlike general action recognition, drivers' environments are often challenging, being gloomy and dark, and with the development of sensors, various cameras such as IR and depth cameras have emerged for analyzing drivers' behaviors. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal fusion transformer, named MultiFuser, which identifies cross-modal interrelations and interactions among multimodal car cabin videos and adaptively integrates different modalities for improved representations. Specifically, MultiFuser comprises layers of Bi-decomposed Modules to model spatiotemporal features, with a modality synthesizer for multimodal features integration. Each Bi-decomposed Module includes a Modal Expertise ViT block for extracting modality-specific features and a Patch-wise Adaptive Fusion block for efficient cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted on Drive&Act dataset and the results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Physical World Backdoor Attacks against Skeleton Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08671v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton Action Recognition (SAR) has attracted significant interest for its efficient representation of the human skeletal structure. Despite its advancements, recent studies have raised security concerns in SAR models, particularly their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. However, such strategies are limited to digital scenarios and ineffective in physical attacks, limiting their real-world applicability. To investigate the vulnerabilities of SAR in the physical world, we introduce the Physical Skeleton Backdoor Attacks (PSBA), the first exploration of physical backdoor attacks against SAR. Considering the practicalities of physical execution, we introduce a novel trigger implantation method that integrates infrequent and imperceivable actions as triggers into the original skeleton data. By incorporating a minimal amount of this manipulated data into the training set, PSBA enables the system misclassify any skeleton sequences into the target class when the trigger action is present. We examine the resilience of PSBA in both poisoned and clean-label scenarios, demonstrating its efficacy across a range of datasets, poisoning ratios, and model architectures. Additionally, we introduce a trigger-enhancing strategy to strengthen attack performance in the clean label setting. The robustness of PSBA is tested against three distinct backdoor defenses, and the stealthiness of PSBA is evaluated using two quantitative metrics. Furthermore, by employing a Kinect V2 camera, we compile a dataset of human actions from the real world to mimic physical attack situations, with our findings confirming the effectiveness of our proposed attacks.

| **[Multi-Modality Co-Learning for Efficient Skeleton-based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15706v6)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition has garnered significant attention due to the utilization of concise and resilient skeletons. Nevertheless, the absence of detailed body information in skeletons restricts performance, while other multimodal methods require substantial inference resources and are inefficient when using multimodal data during both training and inference stages. To address this and fully harness the complementary multimodal features, we propose a novel multi-modality co-learning (MMCL) framework by leveraging the multimodal large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary networks for efficient skeleton-based action recognition, which engages in multi-modality co-learning during the training stage and keeps efficiency by employing only concise skeletons in inference. Our MMCL framework primarily consists of two modules. First, the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) extracts rich RGB features from video frames and aligns them with global skeleton features via contrastive learning. Second, the Feature Refinement Module (FRM) uses RGB images with temporal information and text instruction to generate instructive features based on the powerful generalization of multimodal LLMs. These instructive text features will further refine the classification scores and the refined scores will enhance the model's robustness and generalization in a manner similar to soft labels. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA benchmarks consistently verify the effectiveness of our MMCL, which outperforms the existing skeleton-based action recognition methods. Meanwhile, experiments on UTD-MHAD and SYSU-Action datasets demonstrate the commendable generalization of our MMCL in zero-shot and domain-adaptive action recognition. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/liujf69/MMCL-Action.</p></details> |  | None |

Over the past decade, the field of HAR has witnessed substantial progress by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to effectively extract and comprehend intricate information, thereby enhancing the overall performance of HAR systems. Recently, the domain of computer vision has witnessed the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) as a potent solution. The efficacy of transformer architecture has been validated beyond the confines of image analysis, extending their applicability to diverse video-related tasks. Notably, within this landscape, the research community has shown keen interest in HAR, acknowledging its manifold utility and widespread adoption across various domains. This article aims to present an encompassing survey that focuses on CNNs and the evolution of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to ViTs given their importance in the domain of HAR. By conducting a thorough examination of existing literature and exploring emerging trends, this study undertakes a critical analysis and synthesis of the accumulated knowledge in this field. Additionally, it investigates the ongoing efforts to develop hybrid approaches. Following this direction, this article presents a novel hybrid model that seeks to integrate the inherent strengths of CNNs and ViTs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On the Utility of 3D Hand Poses for Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09805v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D hand pose is an underexplored modality for action recognition. Poses are compact yet informative and can greatly benefit applications with limited compute budgets. However, poses alone offer an incomplete understanding of actions, as they cannot fully capture objects and environments with which humans interact. We propose HandFormer, a novel multimodal transformer, to efficiently model hand-object interactions. HandFormer combines 3D hand poses at a high temporal resolution for fine-grained motion modeling with sparsely sampled RGB frames for encoding scene semantics. Observing the unique characteristics of hand poses, we temporally factorize hand modeling and represent each joint by its short-term trajectories. This factorized pose representation combined with sparse RGB samples is remarkably efficient and highly accurate. Unimodal HandFormer with only hand poses outperforms existing skeleton-based methods at 5x fewer FLOPs. With RGB, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on Assembly101 and H2O with significant improvements in egocentric action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024; https://s-shamil.github.io/HandFormer/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://s-shamil.github.io/HandFormer) |

However, there is still a fairly large gap between the exciting prospects and what can actually be achieved in practice today, especially in videos from the wild. With this perspective paper, we want to contribute towards closing this gap, by guiding behavioral scientists in what can be expected from current methods and steering computer vision researchers towards problems that are relevant to advance research in animal behavior. We start with a survey of the state-of-the-art methods for computer vision problems that are directly relevant to the video-based study of animal behavior, including object detection, multi-individual tracking, individual identification, and (inter)action recognition. We then review methods for effort-efficient learning, which is one of the biggest challenges from a practical perspective. Finally, we close with an outlook into the future of the emerging field of computer vision for animal behavior, where we argue that the field should develop approaches to unify detection, tracking, identification and (inter)action recognition in a single, video-based framework.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present an efficient pose-driven attention-guided multimodal network (EPAM-Net) for action recognition in videos. Specifically, we adapted X3D networks for both RGB and pose streams to capture spatio-temporal features from RGB videos and their skeleton sequences. Then skeleton features are utilized to help the visual network stream focusing on key frames and their salient spatial regions using a spatial temporal attention block. Finally, the scores of the two streams of the proposed network are fused for final classification. The experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance on NTU-D 60 and NTU RGB-D 120 benchmark datasets. Moreover, our model provides a 6.2--9.9x reduction in FLOPs (floating-point operation, in number of multiply-adds) and a 9--9.6x reduction in the number of network parameters.

A holistic 3Dunderstanding of such interactions from egocentric views is important for tasks in robotics, AR/VR, action recognition and motion generation. Accurately reconstructing such interactions in 3D is challenging due to heavy occlusion, viewpoint bias, camera distortion, and motion blur from the head movement. To this end, we designed the HANDS23 challenge based on the AssemblyHands and ARCTIC datasets with carefully designed training and testing splits. Based on the results of the top submitted methods and more recent baselines on the leaderboards, we perform a thorough analysis on 3D hand(-object) reconstruction tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of addressing distortion specific to egocentric cameras, adopting high-capacity transformers to learn complex hand-object interactions, and fusing predictions from different views. Our study further reveals challenging scenarios intractable with state-of-the-art methods, such as fast hand motion, object reconstruction from narrow egocentric views, and close contact between two hands and objects. Our efforts will enrich the community's knowledge foundation and facilitate future hand studies on egocentric hand-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition with Noisy Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09975v2)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human actions from body poses is critical for assistive robots sharing space with humans in order to make informed and safe decisions about the next interaction. However, precise temporal localization and annotation of activity sequences is time-consuming and the resulting labels are often noisy. If not effectively addressed, label noise negatively affects the model's training, resulting in lower recognition quality. Despite its importance, addressing label noise for skeleton-based action recognition has been overlooked so far. In this study, we bridge this gap by implementing a framework that augments well-established skeleton-based human action recognition methods with label-denoising strategies from various research areas to serve as the initial benchmark. Observations reveal that these baselines yield only marginal performance when dealing with sparse skeleton data. Consequently, we introduce a novel methodology, NoiseEraSAR, which integrates global sample selection, co-teaching, and Cross-Modal Mixture-of-Experts (CM-MOE) strategies, aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of label noise. Our proposed approach demonstrates better performance on the established benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art standards.

| **[From Recognition to Prediction: Leveraging Sequence Reasoning for Action Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02769v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The action anticipation task refers to predicting what action will happen based on observed videos, which requires the model to have a strong ability to summarize the present and then reason about the future. Experience and common sense suggest that there is a significant correlation between different actions, which provides valuable prior knowledge for the action anticipation task. However, previous methods have not effectively modeled this underlying statistical relationship. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end video modeling architecture that utilizes attention mechanisms, named Anticipation via Recognition and Reasoning (ARR). ARR decomposes the action anticipation task into action recognition and sequence reasoning tasks, and effectively learns the statistical relationship between actions by next action prediction (NAP). In comparison to existing temporal aggregation strategies, ARR is able to extract more effective features from observable videos to make more reasonable predictions. In addition, to address the challenge of relationship modeling that requires extensive training data, we propose an innovative approach for the unsupervised pre-training of the decoder, which leverages the inherent temporal dynamics of video to enhance the reasoning capabilities of the network. Extensive experiments on the Epic-kitchen-100, EGTEA Gaze+, and 50salads datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.

Although advances in action recognition (AR) and temporal action detection (AD), especially transformer-based models and vision foundation models, have achieved high performance on human action datasets, animal videos remain relatively under-researched. This thesis addresses this gap by proposing the model MARINE, which utilizes motion-based frame selection designed for fast animal actions and DINOv2 feature extraction with a trainable classification head for action recognition. MARINE outperforms VideoMAE in identifying predator attacks in videos of fish, both on a small and specific coral reef dataset (81.53\% against 52.64\% accuracy), and on a subset of the more extensive Animal Kingdom dataset (94.86\% against 83.14\% accuracy). In a multi-label setting on a representative sample of Animal Kingdom, MARINE achieves 23.79\% mAP, positioning it mid-field among existing benchmarks. Furthermore, in an AD task on the coral reef dataset, MARINE achieves 80.78\% AP (against VideoMAE's 34.89\%) although at a lowered t-IoU threshold of 25\%. Therefore, despite room for improvement, MARINE offers an effective starter framework to apply to AR and AD tasks on animal recordings and thus contribute to the study of natural ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an MSc thesis by Zsofia Katona, supervised by the two other authors</p></details> | None |
