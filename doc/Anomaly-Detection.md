| **[Machine learning-based identification of Gaia astrometric exoplanet orbits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09350v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170\,000 astrometric orbit solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun. Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several Gaia DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine learning approach that uses only the Gaia DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions. Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 20 best candidates of which two are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. The companion around the Sun-like star G\,15-6 could be confirmed as a genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 15 figures. Published in MNRAS.

| **[Tests for model misspecification in simulation-based inference: from local distortions to global model checks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15100v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model misspecification analysis strategies, such as anomaly detection, model validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Holmes-VAU: Towards Long-term Video Anomaly Understanding at Any Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06171v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we enable models to comprehend video anomalies occurring over varying temporal scales and contexts? Traditional Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) methods focus on frame-level anomaly prediction, often missing the interpretability of complex and diverse real-world anomalies. Recent multimodal approaches leverage visual and textual data but lack hierarchical annotations that capture both short-term and long-term anomalies. To address this challenge, we introduce HIVAU-70k, a large-scale benchmark for hierarchical video anomaly understanding across any granularity. We develop a semi-automated annotation engine that efficiently scales high-quality annotations by combining manual video segmentation with recursive free-text annotation using large language models (LLMs). This results in over 70,000 multi-granular annotations organized at clip-level, event-level, and video-level segments. For efficient anomaly detection in long videos, we propose the Anomaly-focused Temporal Sampler (ATS). ATS integrates an anomaly scorer with a density-aware sampler to adaptively select frames based on anomaly scores, ensuring that the multimodal LLM concentrates on anomaly-rich regions, which significantly enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our hierarchical instruction data markedly improves anomaly comprehension. The integrated ATS and visual-language model outperform traditional methods in processing long videos. Our benchmark and model are publicly available at https://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAU.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAU) |
| **[Federated Koopman-Reservoir Learning for Large-Scale Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11255v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of edge devices has dramatically increased the generation of multivariate time-series (MVTS) data, essential for applications from healthcare to smart cities. Such data streams, however, are vulnerable to anomalies that signal crucial problems like system failures or security incidents. Traditional MVTS anomaly detection methods, encompassing statistical and centralized machine learning approaches, struggle with the heterogeneity, variability, and privacy concerns of large-scale, distributed environments. In response, we introduce FedKO, a novel unsupervised Federated Learning framework that leverages the linear predictive capabilities of Koopman operator theory along with the dynamic adaptability of Reservoir Computing. This enables effective spatiotemporal processing and privacy preservation for MVTS data. FedKO is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, utilizing a specific federated algorithm to explore a shared Reservoir-Koopman model across diverse datasets. Such a model is then deployable on edge devices for efficient detection of anomalies in local MVTS streams. Experimental results across various datasets showcase FedKO's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in MVTS anomaly detection. Moreover, FedKO reduces up to 8x communication size and 2x memory usage, making it highly suitable for large-scale systems.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 | None |
| **[TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[A Novel Decomposed Feature-Oriented Framework for Open-Set Semantic Segmentation on LiDAR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11097v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a key technique that enables mobile robots to understand and navigate surrounding environments autonomously. However, most existing works focus on segmenting known objects, overlooking the identification of unknown classes, which is common in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a feature-oriented framework for open-set semantic segmentation on LiDAR data, capable of identifying unknown objects while retaining the ability to classify known ones. We design a decomposed dual-decoder network to simultaneously perform closed-set semantic segmentation and generate distinctive features for unknown objects. The network is trained with multi-objective loss functions to capture the characteristics of known and unknown objects. Using the extracted features, we introduce an anomaly detection mechanism to identify unknown objects. By integrating the results of close-set semantic segmentation and anomaly detection, we achieve effective feature-driven LiDAR open-set semantic segmentation. Evaluations on both SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Multi-View Industrial Anomaly Detection with Epipolar Constrained Cross-View Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11088v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-camera systems provide richer contextual information for industrial anomaly detection. However, traditional methods process each view independently, disregarding the complementary information across viewpoints. Existing multi-view anomaly detection approaches typically employ data-driven cross-view attention for feature fusion but fail to leverage the unique geometric properties of multi-camera setups. In this work, we introduce an epipolar geometry-constrained attention module to guide cross-view fusion, ensuring more effective information aggregation. To further enhance the potential of cross-view attention, we propose a pretraining strategy inspired by memory bank-based anomaly detection. This approach encourages normal feature representations to form multiple local clusters and incorporate multi-view aware negative sample synthesis to regularize pretraining. We demonstrate that our epipolar guided multi-view anomaly detection framework outperforms existing methods on the state-of-the-art multi-view anomaly detection dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hoi2Anomaly: An Explainable Anomaly Detection Approach Guided by Human-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10508v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of Image Anomaly Detection (IAD), Existing methods frequently exhibit a paucity of fine-grained, interpretable semantic information, resulting in the detection of anomalous entities or activities that are susceptible to machine illusions. This deficiency often leads to the detection of anomalous entities or actions that are susceptible to machine illusions and lack sufficient explanation. In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to anomaly detection, termed Hoi2Anomaly, which aims to achieve precise discrimination and localization of anomalies. The proposed methodology involves the construction of a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset comprising human-object interaction (HOI) pairs in anomalous scenarios. Second, we have trained an HOI extractor in threat scenarios to localize and match anomalous actions and entities. Finally, explanatory content is generated for the detected anomalous HOI by fine-tuning the visual language pretraining (VLP) framework. The experimental results demonstrate that Hoi2Anomaly surpasses existing generative approaches in terms of precision and explainability. We will release Hoi2Anomaly for the advancement of the field of anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[AnomalyDINO: Boosting Patch-based Few-shot Anomaly Detection with DINOv2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14529v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have set new standards in few-shot anomaly detection. This paper explores whether high-quality visual features alone are sufficient to rival existing state-of-the-art vision-language models. We affirm this by adapting DINOv2 for one-shot and few-shot anomaly detection, with a focus on industrial applications. We show that this approach does not only rival existing techniques but can even outmatch them in many settings. Our proposed vision-only approach, AnomalyDINO, follows the well-established patch-level deep nearest neighbor paradigm, and enables both image-level anomaly prediction and pixel-level anomaly segmentation. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. Despite its simplicity, AnomalyDINO achieves state-of-the-art results in one- and few-shot anomaly detection (e.g., pushing the one-shot performance on MVTec-AD from an AUROC of 93.1% to 96.6%). The reduced overhead, coupled with its outstanding few-shot performance, makes AnomalyDINO a strong candidate for fast deployment, e.g., in industrial contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025 (Oral)</p></details> | None |
