| **[RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7 to 89.1 on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> | None |
| **[Memory Efficient Continual Learning for Edge-Based Visual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02691v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a critical task in computer vision with numerous real-world applications. However, deploying these models on edge devices presents significant challenges, such as constrained computational and memory resources. Additionally, dynamic data distributions in real-world settings necessitate continuous model adaptation, further complicating deployment under limited resources. To address these challenges, we present a novel investigation into the problem of Continual Learning for Visual Anomaly Detection (CLAD) on edge devices. We evaluate the STFPM approach, given its low memory footprint on edge devices, which demonstrates good performance when combined with the Replay approach. Furthermore, we propose to study the behavior of a recently proposed approach, PaSTe, specifically designed for the edge but not yet explored in the Continual Learning context. Our results show that PaSTe is not only a lighter version of STPFM, but it also achieves superior anomaly detection performance, improving the f1 pixel performance by 10% with the Replay technique. In particular, the structure of PaSTe allows us to test it using a series of Compressed Replay techniques, reducing memory overhead by a maximum of 91.5% compared to the traditional Replay for STFPM. Our study proves the feasibility of deploying VAD models that adapt and learn incrementally on CLAD scenarios on resource-constrained edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Discovering Antagonists in Networks of Systems: Robot Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20125v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A contextual anomaly detection method is proposed and applied to the physical motions of a robot swarm executing a coverage task. Using simulations of a swarm's normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment. During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antagonistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion correctly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally, the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the detection criterion are increased.</p></details> | reduced file size | None |
| **[Reap the Wild Wind: Detecting Media Storms in Large-Scale News Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09299v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Media Storms, dramatic outbursts of attention to a story, are central components of media dynamics and the attention landscape. Despite their significance, there has been little systematic and empirical research on this concept due to issues of measurement and operationalization. We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in two scenarios: first, supplementing an initial list of media storms within a specific time frame; and second, detecting media storms in new time periods. We make available a media storm dataset compiled using both scenarios. Both the method and dataset offer the basis for comprehensive empirical research into the concept of media storms, including characterizing them and predicting their outbursts and durations, in mainstream media or social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted and published in Findings of EMNLP 2024.

| **[World Models for Anomaly Detection during Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02552v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based controllers are often purposefully kept out of real-world applications due to concerns about their safety and reliability. We explore how state-of-the-art world models in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning can be utilized beyond the training phase to ensure a deployed policy only operates within regions of the state-space it is sufficiently familiar with. This is achieved by continuously monitoring discrepancies between a world model's predictions and observed system behavior during inference. It allows for triggering appropriate measures, such as an emergency stop, once an error threshold is surpassed. This does not require any task-specific knowledge and is thus universally applicable. Simulated experiments on established robot control tasks show the effectiveness of this method, recognizing changes in local robot geometry and global gravitational magnitude. Real-world experiments using an agile quadcopter further demonstrate the benefits of this approach by detecting unexpected forces acting on the vehicle. These results indicate how even in new and adverse conditions, safe and reliable operation of otherwise unpredictable learning-based controllers can be achieved.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UMGAD: Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12556v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a critical task in graph machine learning, with the primary objective of identifying anomalous nodes that deviate significantly from the majority. This task is widely applied in various real-world scenarios, including fraud detection and social network analysis. However, existing GAD methods still face two major challenges: (1) They are often limited to detecting anomalies in single-type interaction graphs and struggle with multiple interaction types in multiplex heterogeneous graphs. (2) In unsupervised scenarios, selecting appropriate anomaly score thresholds remains a significant challenge for accurate anomaly detection. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection method, named UMGAD. We first learn multi-relational correlations among nodes in multiplex heterogeneous graphs and capture anomaly information during node attribute and structure reconstruction through graph-masked autoencoder (GMAE). Then, to further extract abnormal information, we generate attribute-level and subgraph-level augmented-view graphs respectively, and perform attribute and structure reconstruction through GMAE. Finally, we learn to optimize node attributes and structural features through contrastive learning between original-view and augmented-view graphs to improve the model's ability to capture anomalies. Meanwhile, we also propose a new anomaly score threshold selection strategy, which allows the model to be independent of ground truth information in real unsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that our UMGAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 13.48% in AUC and 11.68% in Macro-F1 across all datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Intrinsic Normal Prototypes within a Single Image for Universal Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02424v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-Guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class, and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability.

| **[Fence Theorem: Towards Dual-Objective Semantic-Structure Isolation in Preprocessing Phase for 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01100v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D anomaly detection (AD) is prominent but difficult due to lacking a unified theoretical foundation for preprocessing design. We establish the Fence Theorem, formalizing preprocessing as a dual-objective semantic isolator: (1) mitigating cross-semantic interference to the greatest extent feasible and (2) confining anomaly judgments to aligned semantic spaces wherever viable, thereby establishing intra-semantic comparability. Any preprocessing approach achieves this goal through a two-stage process of Emantic-Division and Spatial-Constraints stage. Through systematic deconstruction, we theoretically and experimentally subsume existing preprocessing methods under this theorem via tripartite evidence: qualitative analyses, quantitative studies, and mathematical proofs. Guided by the Fence Theorem, we implement Patch3D, consisting of Patch-Cutting and Patch-Matching modules, to segment semantic spaces and consolidate similar ones while independently modeling normal features within each space. Experiments on Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD with different settings demonstrate that progressively finer-grained semantic alignment in preprocessing directly enhances point-level AD accuracy, providing inverse validation of the theorem's causal logic.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01150v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks like anomaly detection, unsupervised classification, and similarity searches in high-energy data sets. This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard <10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</p></details> | None |
| **[Robust Anomaly Detection via Tensor Pseudoskeleton Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09926v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection plays a critical role in modern data-driven applications, from identifying fraudulent transactions and safeguarding network infrastructure to monitoring sensor systems for irregular patterns. Traditional approaches, such as distance, density, or cluster-based methods, face significant challenges when applied to high dimensional tensor data, where complex interdependencies across dimensions amplify noise and computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper leverages Tensor Chidori pseudoskeleton decomposition within a tensor-robust principal component analysis framework to extract low Tucker rank structure while isolating sparse anomalies, ensuring robustness to anomaly detection. We establish theoretical results regarding convergence, and estimation error, demonstrating the stability and accuracy of the proposed approach. Numerical experiments on real-world spatiotemporal data from New York City taxi trip records validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting anomalous urban events compared to existing benchmark methods. Our results suggest that tensor pseudoskeleton decomposition may offer potential for enhancing anomaly detection in large-scale, high-dimensional data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Anomaly detection in non-stationary videos using time-recursive differencing network based prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02234v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most videos, including those captured through aerial remote sensing, are usually non-stationary in nature having time-varying feature statistics. Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive, data-driven framework for large-scale airborne infrared inspection of North American solar installations. Leveraging high-resolution thermal imagery, we construct and curate a geographically diverse dataset encompassing thousands of PV sites, enabling machine learning-based detection and localization of defects that are not detectable in the visible spectrum. Our pipeline integrates advanced image processing, georeferencing, and airborne thermal infrared anomaly detection to provide rigorous estimates of performance losses. We highlight practical considerations in aerial data collection, annotation methodologies, and model deployment across a wide range of environmental and operational conditions. Our work delivers new insights into the reliability of large-scale solar assets and serves as a foundation for ongoing research on performance trends, predictive maintenance, and scalable analytics in the renewable energy sector.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Building Machine Learning Challenges for Anomaly Detection in Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02112v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discoveries are often made by finding a pattern or object that was not predicted by the known rules of science. Oftentimes, these anomalous events or objects that do not conform to the norms are an indication that the rules of science governing the data are incomplete, and something new needs to be present to explain these unexpected outliers. The challenge of finding anomalies can be confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge of the known scientific behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on the data to look for deviations. When utilizing machine learning, this presents a particular challenge since we require that the model not only understands scientific data perfectly but also recognizes when the data is inconsistent and out of the scope of its trained behavior. In this paper, we present three datasets aimed at developing machine learning-based anomaly detection for disparate scientific domains covering astrophysics, genomics, and polar science. We present the different datasets along with a scheme to make machine learning challenges around the three datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we present an approach that generalizes to future machine learning challenges, enabling the possibility of large, more compute-intensive challenges that can ultimately lead to scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages 6 figures to be submitted to Nature Communications</p></details> | None |

The IRP enhances defect detection accuracy through a cyclic data refinement strategy, iteratively removing misleading data points to improve model performance and robustness. We validate the IRP's effectiveness using two benchmark datasets, Kolektor SDD2 (KSDD2) and MVTec AD, covering a wide range of industrial products and defect types. Our experimental results demonstrate that the IRP consistently outperforms traditional anomaly detection models, particularly in environments with high noise levels. This study highlights the IRP's potential to significantly enhance anomaly detection processes in industrial settings, effectively managing the challenges of sparse and noisy data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VISAPP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Fairness in Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection through Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00987v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is increasingly crucial in various applications, ranging from financial fraud detection to fake news detection. However, current GAD methods largely overlook the fairness problem, which might result in discriminatory decisions skewed toward certain demographic groups defined on sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.). This greatly limits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios in light of societal and ethical restrictions. To address this critical gap, we make the first attempt to integrate fairness with utility in GAD decision-making. Specifically, we devise a novel DisEntangle-based FairnEss-aware aNomaly Detection framework on the attributed graph, named DEFEND. DEFEND first introduces disentanglement in GNNs to capture informative yet sensitive-irrelevant node representations, effectively reducing societal bias inherent in graph representation learning. Besides, to alleviate discriminatory bias in evaluating anomalous nodes, DEFEND adopts a reconstruction-based anomaly detection, which concentrates solely on node attributes without incorporating any graph structure. Additionally, given the inherent association between input and sensitive attributes, DEFEND constrains the correlation between the reconstruction error and the predicted sensitive attributes. Our empirical evaluations on real-world datasets reveal that DEFEND performs effectively in GAD and significantly enhances fairness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Meta Learning-Driven Iterative Refinement for Robust Anomaly Detection in Industrial Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01569v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the performance of robust anomaly detection models in industrial inspection, focusing particularly on their ability to handle noisy data. We propose to leverage the adaptation ability of meta learning approaches to identify and reject noisy training data to improve the learning process. In our model, we employ Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) and an iterative refinement process through an Inter-Quartile Range rejection scheme to enhance their adaptability and robustness. This approach significantly improves the models capability to distinguish between normal and defective conditions. Our results of experiments conducted on well known MVTec and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only excels in environments with substantial noise but can also contribute in case of a clear training set, isolating those samples that are relatively out of distribution, thus offering significant improvements over traditional models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the VISION workshop at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[AnyECG: Foundational Models for Multitask Cardiac Analysis in Real-World Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17711v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac monitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental results show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6% across four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common ECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each of these tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards a General Time Series Anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15273v4)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.

Traditional approaches often struggle with high false-positive rates, frequently misclassifying normal shadows and surface deformations as defects, an issue that becomes particularly pronounced in products with complex and intricate surface features. To address these challenges, we introduce PA-CLIP, a zero-shot anomaly detection method that reduces background noise and enhances defect detection through a pseudo-anomaly-based framework. The proposed method integrates a multiscale feature aggregation strategy for capturing detailed global and local information, two memory banks for distinguishing background information, including normal patterns and pseudo-anomalies, from true anomaly features, and a decision-making module designed to minimize false positives caused by environmental variations while maintaining high defect sensitivity. Demonstrated on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, PA-CLIP outperforms existing zero-shot methods, providing a robust solution for industrial defect detection.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |
| **[OIPR: Evaluation for Time-series Anomaly Detection Inspired by Operator Interest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01260v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of time-series anomaly detection (TAD) technology, numerous studies have employed deep learning-based detectors for analyzing time-series data in the fields of Internet services, industrial systems, and sensors. The selection and optimization of anomaly detectors strongly rely on the availability of an effective performance evaluation method for TAD. Since anomalies in time-series data often manifest as a sequence of points, conventional metrics that solely consider the detection of individual point are inadequate. Existing evaluation methods for TAD typically employ point-based or event-based metrics to capture the temporal context. However, point-based metrics tend to overestimate detectors that excel only in detecting long anomalies, while event-based metrics are susceptible to being misled by fragmented detection results. To address these limitations, we propose OIPR, a novel set of TAD evaluation metrics. It models the process of operators receiving detector alarms and handling faults, utilizing area under the operator interest curve to evaluate the performance of TAD algorithms. Furthermore, we build a special scenario dataset to compare the characteristics of different evaluation methods. Through experiments conducted on the special scenario dataset and five real-world datasets, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of OIPR in extreme and complex scenarios. It achieves a balance between point and event perspectives, overcoming their primary limitations and offering applicability to broader situations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Language-Assisted Feature Transformation for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01184v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces LAFT, a novel feature transformation method designed to incorporate user knowledge and preferences into anomaly detection using natural language. Accurately modeling the boundary of normality is crucial for distinguishing abnormal data, but this is often challenging due to limited data or the presence of nuisance attributes. While unsupervised methods that rely solely on data without user guidance are common, they may fail to detect anomalies of specific interest. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Assisted Feature Transformation (LAFT), which leverages the shared image-text embedding space of vision-language models to transform visual features according to user-defined requirements. Combined with anomaly detection methods, LAFT effectively aligns visual features with user preferences, allowing anomalies of interest to be detected. Extensive experiments on both toy and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

Traditional health management methods, relying on expert identification or simple rule-based algorithms, struggle to cope with the dynamic heterogeneous networks (DHNs) environment. Moreover, current state-of-the-art distributed anomaly detection methods, which utilize specific machine learning techniques, lack multi-scale adaptivity for heterogeneous device information, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy for DHNs. In this paper, we develop an LLM-assisted end-to-end intelligent network health management framework. The framework first proposes a Multi-Scale Semanticized Anomaly Detection Model (MSADM), incorporating semantic rule trees with an attention mechanism to address the multi-scale anomaly detection problem in DHNs. Secondly, a chain-of-thought-based large language model is embedded in downstream to adaptively analyze the fault detection results and produce an analysis report with detailed fault information and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our proposed MSADM for heterogeneous network entity anomaly detection is as high as 91.31\%.</p></details> |  | None |

How can we identify multiple types of intrusions and capture their characteristic behaviors? The tensor data consists of categorical and continuous attributes and the data distributions of continuous attributes typically exhibit skew. These data properties require handling skewed infinite and finite dimensional spaces simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel streaming method, namely CyberCScope. The method effectively decomposes incoming tensors into major trends while explicitly distinguishing between categorical and skewed continuous attributes. To our knowledge, it is the first to compute hybrid skewed infinite and finite dimensional decomposition. Based on this decomposition, it streamingly finds distinct time-evolving patterns, enabling the detection of multiple types of anomalies. Extensive experiments on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that CyberCScope detects various intrusions with higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while providing meaningful summaries for the intrusions that occur in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 short research paper</p></details> | None |

This paper presents a methodology for non-destructively detecting cracks in UAM propellers using drone propeller sound datasets. Normal operating sounds were recorded, and abnormal sounds (categorized as ripped and broken) were differentiated by varying the microphone-propeller angle and throttle power. Our novel approach integrates FFT and STFT preprocessing techniques to capture both global frequency patterns and local time-frequency variations, thereby enhancing anomaly detection performance. The constructed Acoustic Dataset for Crack of Drone Propeller (ADCP) demonstrates the potential for detecting propeller cracks and lays the groundwork for future UAM maintenance applications.</p></details> | 25 pages | None |
| **[End-to-End Augmentation Hyperparameter Tuning for Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12033v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that presents supervisory signals to real-world problems, bypassing the extensive cost of manual labeling. Consequently, self-supervised anomaly detection (SSAD) has seen a recent surge of interest, since SSL is especially attractive for unsupervised tasks. However, recent works have reported that the choice of a data augmentation function has significant impact on the accuracy of SSAD, posing augmentation search as an essential but nontrivial problem with the lack of labeled validation data. In this paper, we introduce ST-SSAD, the first systematic approach for rigorous augmentation tuning on SSAD. To this end, our work presents two key contributions. The first is a new unsupervised validation loss that quantifies the alignment between augmented training data and unlabeled validation data. The second is new differentiable augmentation functions, allowing data augmentation hyperparameter(s) to be tuned in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two testbeds with semantic class anomalies and subtle industrial defects show that ST-SSAD gives significant performance gains over existing works.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transformer Based Self-Context Aware Prediction for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00670v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in videos is a challenging task as anomalies in different videos are of different kinds. Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

| **[TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

This innovative method revolutionizes healthcare by facilitating early disease detection and tailored care, particularly in chronic disease management, where IoMT automates treatments based on real-time health data collection. Nonetheless, its benefits are countered by significant security challenges that endanger the lives of its users due to the sensitivity and value of the processed data, thereby attracting malicious interests. Moreover, the utilization of wireless communication for data transmission exposes medical data to interception and tampering by cybercriminals. Additionally, anomalies may arise due to human error, network interference, or hardware malfunctions. In this context, anomaly detection based on Machine Learning (ML) is an interesting solution, but it comes up against obstacles in terms of explicability and privacy protection. To address these challenges, a new framework for Intrusion Detection Systems is introduced, leveraging Artificial Neural Networks for intrusion detection while utilizing Federated Learning (FL) for privacy preservation. Additionally, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods are incorporated to enhance model explanation and interpretation. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated and compared with centralized approaches using multiple datasets containing network and medical data, simulating various attack types impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical and physiological data. The results obtained offer compelling evidence that the FL method performs comparably to the centralized method, demonstrating high performance. Additionally, it affords the dual advantage of safeguarding privacy and providing model explanation while adhering to ethical principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures, 15 tables, journal paper</p></details> | None |

Most research assumes ideal closed-set environments. However, in real-world open-set environments, graph learning models face challenges in robustness and reliability due to unseen classes. This highlights the need for Graph Open-Set Recognition (GOSR) methods to address these issues and ensure effective GNN application in practical scenarios. Research in GOSR is in its early stages, with a lack of a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse tasks and datasets to evaluate methods. Moreover, traditional methods, Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection (GOODD), GOSR, and Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) have mostly evolved in isolation, with little exploration of their interconnections or potential applications to GOSR. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textbf{G-OSR}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GOSR methods at both the node and graph levels, using datasets from multiple domains to ensure fair and standardized comparisons of effectiveness and efficiency across traditional, GOODD, GOSR, and GAD methods. The results offer critical insights into the generalizability and limitations of current GOSR methods and provide valuable resources for advancing research in this field through systematic analysis of diverse approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages,2 figures | None |
| **[Value Gradient Sampler: Sampling as Sequential Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13280v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Value Gradient Sampler (VGS), a trainable sampler based on the interpretation of sampling as discrete-time sequential decision-making. VGS generates samples from a given unnormalized density (i.e., energy) by drifting and diffusing randomly initialized particles. In VGS, finding the optimal drift is equivalent to solving an optimal control problem where the cost is the upper bound of the KL divergence between the target density and the samples. We employ value-based dynamic programming to solve this optimal control problem, which gives the gradient of the value function as the optimal drift vector. The connection to sequential decision making allows VGS to leverage extensively studied techniques in reinforcement learning, making VGS a fast, adaptive, and accurate sampler that achieves competitive results in various sampling benchmarks. Furthermore, VGS can replace MCMC in contrastive divergence training of energy-based models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VGS in training accurate energy-based models in industrial anomaly detection applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/swyoon/value-gradient-sampler/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/swyoon/value-gradient-sampler) |

Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> | None |
| **[When Unsupervised Domain Adaptation meets One-class Anomaly Detection: Addressing the Two-fold Unsupervised Curse by Leveraging Anomaly Scarcity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21022v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first fully unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). The performance of UAD techniques degrades significantly in the presence of a domain shift, difficult to avoid in a real-world setting. While UDA has contributed to solving this issue in binary and multi-class classification, such a strategy is ill-posed in UAD. This might be explained by the unsupervised nature of the two tasks, namely, domain adaptation and anomaly detection. Herein, we first formulate this problem that we call the two-fold unsupervised curse. Then, we propose a pioneering solution to this curse, considered intractable so far, by assuming that anomalies are rare. Specifically, we leverage clustering techniques to identify a dominant cluster in the target feature space. Posed as the normal cluster, the latter is aligned with the source normal features. Concretely, given a one-class source set and an unlabeled target set composed mostly of normal data and some anomalies, we fit the source features within a hypersphere while jointly aligning them with the features of the dominant cluster from the target set. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis on common adaptation benchmarks for anomaly detection, demonstrating the relevance of both the newly introduced paradigm and the proposed approach. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

The limited class diversity inherent to one-class classification tasks, combined with distribution biases caused by variations in products across and within clients, poses significant challenges for preserving data privacy with federated UAD. Thus, this article proposes an efficient federated learning method with dynamic memory and memory-reduce for unsupervised image anomaly detection, called FedDyMem. Considering all client data belongs to a single class (i.e., normal sample) in UAD and the distribution of intra-class features demonstrates significant skewness, FedDyMem facilitates knowledge sharing between the client and server through the client's dynamic memory bank instead of model parameters. In the local clients, a memory generator and a metric loss are employed to improve the consistency of the feature distribution for normal samples, leveraging the local model to update the memory bank dynamically. For efficient communication, a memory-reduce method based on weighted averages is proposed to significantly decrease the scale of memory banks. On the server, global memory is constructed and distributed to individual clients through k-means aggregation. Experiments conducted on six industrial and medical datasets, comprising a mixture of six products or health screening types derived from eleven public datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDyMem.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, we propose a Distribution Prototype Diffusion Learning (DPDL) method aimed at enclosing normal samples within a compact and discriminative distribution space. Specifically, we construct multiple learnable Gaussian prototypes to create a latent representation space for abundant and diverse normal samples and learn a Schr\"odinger bridge to facilitate a diffusive transition toward these prototypes for normal samples while steering anomaly samples away. Moreover, to enhance inter-sample separation, we design a dispersion feature learning way in hyperspherical space, which benefits the identification of out-of-distribution anomalies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DPDL, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Generative models can mitigate this issue by synthesizing realistic defect samples, but existing approaches often fail to model the crucial interplay between defects and their background. This oversight leads to unrealistic anomalies, especially in scenarios where contextual consistency is essential (i.e., logical anomaly). To address this, we propose a novel background-aware defect generation framework, where the background influences defect denoising without affecting the background itself by ensuring realistic synthesis while preserving structural integrity. Our method leverages a disentanglement loss to separate the background' s denoising process from the defect, enabling controlled defect synthesis through DDIM Inversion. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach maintains background fidelity while generating contextually accurate defects. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and MVTec Loco benchmarks validate our mehtod's superiority over existing techniques in both defect generation quality and anomaly detection performance.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[One-for-More: Continual Diffusion Model for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19848v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of generative models, there is a growing interest in unifying all tasks within a generative framework. Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and ``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of ``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model. For continual anomaly detection, ours achieves first place in 17/18 settings on MVTec and VisA.

Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem, extending traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan aeroengine degradation. TDC-AE outperforms LSTMs and Transformers while achieving a 200x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust, interpretable signal for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.</p></details> |  | None |

With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  | None |

Another 16.5% of days feature less severe but still significant disruptions focused on certain regions of the NAS, while on the remaining 81.5% of days the NAS operates relatively smoothly. Anomaly detection results show good agreement with cluster results and further distinguish days in the same cluster by severity of disruptions. Results show an increasing trend in frequency of disruptions especially post-COVID.

Consequently, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data has emerged as an essential task to maintain the reliability and robustness of data-driven models, in general, and machine and deep learning models, in particular. In this study, we leveraged the convex hull property of a dataset and the fact that anomalies highly contribute to the increase of the CH's volume to propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm. Our algorithm computes the CH's volume as an increasing number of data points are removed from the dataset to define a decision line between OOD and in-distribution data points. We compared the proposed algorithm to seven widely used anomaly detection algorithms over ten datasets, showing comparable results for state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Moreover, we show that with a computationally cheap and simple check, one can detect datasets that are well-suited for the proposed algorithm which outperforms the SOTA anomaly detection algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by these developments, we investigate the adaptation of such algorithms to the audio domain to address the problem of Audio Anomaly Detection (AAD).

This capability enables a more precise understanding of where and when anomalies occur, making the results more actionable for end users. We evaluate our approach on industrial and environmental benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of VAD techniques in detecting anomalies in audio signals. Moreover, they improve explainability by enabling localized anomaly identification, making audio anomaly detection systems more interpretable and practical.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Signature Isolation Forest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04405v4)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) is a recent state-of-the-art Anomaly Detection (AD) algorithm designed for functional data. It relies on a tree partition procedure where an abnormality score is computed by projecting each curve observation on a drawn dictionary through a linear inner product. Such linear inner product and the dictionary are a priori choices that highly influence the algorithm's performances and might lead to unreliable results, particularly with complex datasets. This work addresses these challenges by introducing \textit{Signature Isolation Forest}, a novel AD algorithm class leveraging the rough path theory's signature transform. Our objective is to remove the constraints imposed by FIF through the proposition of two algorithms which specifically target the linearity of the FIF inner product and the choice of the dictionary. We provide several numerical experiments, including a real-world applications benchmark showing the relevance of our methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Approaches to the design of intrusion detection systems must evolve and go beyond the traditional concept of perimeter control to build on new paradigms that exploit the typical characteristics of future 5G and 6G networks, such as in-network computing and intelligent programmable data planes. The aim of this research is to propose a disruptive paradigm in which devices in a typical data plane of a future programmable network have anomaly detection capabilities and cooperate in a fully distributed fashion to act as an ML-enabled Intrusion Prevention System ``embedded" into the network. The reported proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm allows working effectively and with a good level of precision while occupying overall less CPU and RAM resources of the devices involved.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted and accepted to the IEEE for publication</p></details> | None |

However, there are several issues that must be addressed, such as the fact that their ability to capture long-term dependencies is not completely reliable, their computational complexity levels are high, and the spatiotemporal features of WSN timing data are not sufficiently extracted for detecting the correlation anomalies of multinode WSN timing data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a WSN anomaly detection method that integrates frequency-domain features with dynamic graph neural networks (GNN) under a designed self-encoder reconstruction framework. First, the discrete wavelet transform effectively decomposes trend and seasonal components of time series to solve the poor long-term reliability of transformers. Second, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to make full use of the difference between the amplitude distributions of normal data and anomalous data in this domain. Finally, a multimodal fusion-based dynamic graph convolutional network (MFDGCN) is designed by combining an attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to adaptively extract spatial correlation features. A series of experiments conducted on public datasets and their results demonstrate that the anomaly detection method designed in this paper exhibits superior precision and recall than the existing methods do, with an F1 score of 93.5%, representing an improvement of 2.9% over that of the existing models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mllm-ts/VisualTimeAnomaly to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for the main content; 32 pages for the full paper including the appendix.

Traditional unsupervised methods, which decode encoded latent representations of unlabeled data with a reconstruction focus, often fail to capture critical discriminative content, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection. To address these challenges, we present a Diffusion-based Graph Anomaly Detector (DiffGAD). At the heart of DiffGAD is a novel latent space learning paradigm, meticulously designed to enhance its proficiency by guiding it with discriminative content. This innovative approach leverages diffusion sampling to infuse the latent space with discriminative content and introduces a content-preservation mechanism that retains valuable information across different scales, significantly improving its adeptness at identifying anomalies with limited time and space complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of DiffGAD, conducted on six real-world and large-scale datasets with various metrics, demonstrated its exceptional performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A digital eye-fixation biomarker using a deep anomaly scheme to classify Parkisonian patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17762v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oculomotor alterations constitute a promising biomarker to detect and characterize Parkinson's disease (PD), even in prodromal stages. Currently, only global and simplified eye movement trajectories are employed to approximate the complex and hidden kinematic relationships of the oculomotor function. Recent advances on machine learning and video analysis have encouraged novel characterizations of eye movement patterns to quantify PD. These schemes enable the identification of spatiotemporal segments primarily associated with PD. However, they rely on discriminative models that require large training datasets and depend on balanced class distributions. This work introduces a novel video analysis scheme to quantify Parkinsonian eye fixation patterns with an anomaly detection framework. Contrary to classical deep discriminative schemes that learn differences among labeled classes, the proposed approach is focused on one-class learning, avoiding the necessity of a significant amount of data. The proposed approach focuses only on Parkinson's representation, considering any other class sample as an anomaly of the distribution. This approach was evaluated for an ocular fixation task, in a total of 13 control subjects and 13 patients on different stages of the disease. The proposed digital biomarker achieved an average sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.63, respectively, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.95. A statistical test shows significant differences (p < 0.05) among predicted classes, evidencing a discrimination between patients and control subjects.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 images | None |
| **[MAD-AD: Masked Diffusion for Unsupervised Brain Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16943v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain images is crucial for identifying injuries and pathologies without access to labels. However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies.

Additionally, the lack of interpretability creates key barriers to the adoption of semi-supervised frameworks in practice. Most existing interpretation methods are developed for supervised/unsupervised frameworks or non-security domains and fail to provide reliable interpretations. In this paper, we propose AnomalyAID, a general framework aiming to (1) make the anomaly detection process interpretable and improve the reliability of interpretation results, and (2) assign high-confidence pseudo labels to unlabeled samples for improving the performance of anomaly detection systems with limited supervised data. For (1), we propose a novel interpretation approach that leverages global and local interpreters to provide reliable explanations, while for (2), we design a new two-stage semi-supervised learning framework for network anomaly detection by aligning both stages' model predictions with special constraints. We apply AnomalyAID over two representative network anomaly detection tasks and extensively evaluate AnomalyAID with representative prior works. Experimental results demonstrate that AnomalyAID can provide accurate detection results with reliable interpretations for semi-supervised network anomaly detection systems.

| **[Do Language Models Understand Time?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13845v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.

Current DFL architectures ensure the trustworthiness of the aggregator node upon selection. However, most of these studies overlook the possibility that the aggregating node may turn rogue and act maliciously after being nominated. To address this problem, this paper proposes a DFL structure, called TrustChain, that scores the aggregators before selection based on their past behavior and additionally audits them after the aggregation. To do this, the statistical independence between the client updates and the aggregated model is continuously monitored using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The proposed method relies on several principles, including blockchain, anomaly detection, and concept drift analysis. The designed structure is evaluated on several federated datasets and attack scenarios with different numbers of Byzantine nodes.</p></details> |  | None |

The ability to detect anomalous situations outside of the operational design domain is a key component in self-driving cars, enabling us to mitigate the impact of abnormal ego behaviors and to realize trustworthy driving systems. On-road anomaly detection in egocentric videos remains a challenging problem due to the difficulties introduced by complex and interactive scenarios. We conduct a holistic analysis of common on-road anomaly patterns, from which we propose three unsupervised anomaly detection experts: a scene expert that focuses on frame-level appearances to detect abnormal scenes and unexpected scene motions; an interaction expert that models normal relative motions between two road participants and raises alarms whenever anomalous interactions emerge; and a behavior expert which monitors abnormal behaviors of individual objects by future trajectory prediction. To combine the strengths of all the modules, we propose an expert ensemble (Xen) using a Kalman filter, in which the final anomaly score is absorbed as one of the states and the observations are generated by the experts. Our experiments employ a novel evaluation protocol for realistic model performance, demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance than previous methods, and show that our framework has potential in classifying anomaly types using unsupervised learning on a large-scale on-road anomaly dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> | None |

This approach can achieve satisfactory results in cases where samples of a given deepfake generation technique have been seen during training, but can easily fail with deepfakes generated by other techniques. In this paper, we propose DiffFake, a novel deepfake detector that approaches the detection problem as an anomaly detection task. Specifically, DiffFake learns natural changes that occur between two facial images of the same person by leveraging a differential anomaly detection framework. This is done by combining pairs of deep face embeddings and using them to train an anomaly detection model. We further propose to train a feature extractor on pseudo-deepfakes with global and local artifacts, to extract meaningful and generalizable features that can then be used to train the anomaly detection model. We perform extensive experiments on five different deepfake datasets and show that our method can match and sometimes even exceed the performance of state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025 AI4MFDD Workshop</p></details> | None |

With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects.

In this context, effectively controlling Type I error rates ($\alpha$) without compromising the statistical power ($1-\beta$) of these systems can build trust and reduce costs related to false discoveries. The field of conformal anomaly detection emerges as a promising approach for providing respective statistical guarantees by model calibration. However, the dependency on calibration data poses practical limitations - especially within low-data regimes. In this work, we formally define and evaluate leave-one-out-, bootstrap-, and cross-conformal methods for anomaly detection, incrementing on methods from the field of conformal prediction. Looking beyond the classical inductive conformal anomaly detection, we demonstrate that derived methods for calculating resampling-conformal $p$-values strike a practical compromise between statistical efficiency (full-conformal) and computational efficiency (split-conformal) as they make more efficient use of available data. We validate derived methods and quantify their improvements for a range of one-class classifiers and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Knowledge Graph (ICKG)</p></details> | None |

However, while labeled anomalies are often scarce in emerging applications, existing supervised GAD approaches are either ineffective or not applicable when moved across graph domains due to distribution shifts and heterogeneous feature spaces. To address these challenges, we present AdaGraph-T3, a novel test-time training framework for cross-domain GAD. AdaGraph-T3 combines supervised and self-supervised learning during training while adapting to a new domain during test time using only self-supervised learning by leveraging a homophily-based affinity score that captures domain-invariant properties of anomalies. Our framework introduces four key innovations to cross-domain GAD: an effective self-supervision scheme, an attention-based mechanism that dynamically learns edge importance weights during message passing, domain-specific encoders for handling heterogeneous features, and class-aware regularization to address imbalance. Experiments across multiple cross-domain settings demonstrate that AdaGraph-T3 significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving average improvements of over 6.6% in AUROC and 7.9% in AUPRC compared to the best competing model.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures, accepted by the 103rd Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting, under review by Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board</p></details> | None |

Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative embeddings. These embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures | None |

Generally, it can be trained merely on normal data, without a requirement for abnormal samples, and thereby plays an important role in rare disease recognition and health screening in the medical domain. Despite the emergence of numerous methods for medical AD, the lack of a fair and comprehensive evaluation causes ambiguous conclusions and hinders the development of this field. To address this problem, this paper builds a benchmark with unified comparison. Seven medical datasets with five image modalities, including chest X-rays, brain MRIs, retinal fundus images, dermatoscopic images, and histopathology images, are curated for extensive evaluation. Thirty typical AD methods, including reconstruction and self-supervised learning-based methods, are involved in comparison of image-level anomaly classification and pixel-level anomaly segmentation. Furthermore, for the first time, we systematically investigate the effect of key components in existing methods, revealing unresolved challenges and potential future directions.

Flow-based generative models provide a powerful framework for capturing complex probability distributions, offering exact likelihood estimation, efficient sampling, and deterministic transformations between distributions. These models leverage invertible mappings governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), enabling precise density estimation and likelihood evaluation. This tutorial presents an intuitive mathematical framework for flow-based generative models, formulating them as neural network-based representations of continuous probability densities. We explore key theoretical principles, including the Wasserstein metric, gradient flows, and density evolution governed by ODEs, to establish convergence guarantees and bridge empirical advancements with theoretical insights. By providing a rigorous yet accessible treatment, we aim to equip researchers and practitioners with the necessary tools to effectively apply flow-based generative models in signal processing and machine learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cluster Aware Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09770v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection has gained significant attention across various domains, particularly in critical applications like fraud detection in e-commerce platforms and insider threat detection in cybersecurity. Usually, these data are composed of multiple types (e.g., user information and transaction records for financial data), thus exhibiting view heterogeneity. However, in the era of big data, the heterogeneity of views and the lack of label information pose substantial challenges to traditional approaches. Existing unsupervised graph anomaly detection methods often struggle with high-dimensionality issues, rely on strong assumptions about graph structures or fail to handle complex multi-view graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a cluster aware multi-view graph anomaly detection method, called CARE. Our approach captures both local and global node affinities by augmenting the graph's adjacency matrix with the pseudo-label (i.e., soft membership assignments) without any strong assumption about the graph. To mitigate potential biases from the pseudo-label, we introduce a similarity-guided loss. Theoretically, we show that the proposed similarity-guided loss is a variant of contrastive learning loss, and we present how this loss alleviates the bias introduced by pseudo-label with the connection to graph spectral clustering. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Specifically, CARE outperforms the second-best competitors by more than 39% on the Amazon dataset with respect to AUPRC and 18.7% on the YelpChi dataset with respect to AUROC. The code of our method is available at the GitHub link: https://github.com/zhenglecheng/CARE-demo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhenglecheng/CARE-demo) |
| **[VUS: Effective and Efficient Accuracy Measures for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13318v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task for time-series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. In contrast to other domains where AD mainly focuses on point-based anomalies (i.e., outliers in standalone observations), AD for time series is also concerned with range-based anomalies (i.e., outliers spanning multiple observations). Nevertheless, it is common to use traditional point-based information retrieval measures, such as Precision, Recall, and F-score, to assess the quality of methods by thresholding the anomaly score to mark each point as an anomaly or not. However, mapping discrete labels into continuous data introduces unavoidable shortcomings, complicating the evaluation of range-based anomalies. Notably, the choice of evaluation measure may significantly bias the experimental outcome. Despite over six decades of attention, there has never been a large-scale systematic quantitative and qualitative analysis of time-series AD evaluation measures. This paper extensively evaluates quality measures for time-series AD to assess their robustness under noise, misalignments, and different anomaly cardinality ratios. Our results indicate that measures producing quality values independently of a threshold (i.e., AUC-ROC and AUC-PR) are more suitable for time-series AD. Motivated by this observation, we first extend the AUC-based measures to account for range-based anomalies. Then, we introduce a new family of parameter-free and threshold-independent measures, Volume Under the Surface (VUS), to evaluate methods while varying parameters. We also introduce two optimized implementations for VUS that reduce significantly the execution time of the initial implementation. Our findings demonstrate that our four measures are significantly more robust in assessing the quality of time-series AD methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Survey of Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13256v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our increasingly interconnected world, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a crucial role in industries like healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing by combining physical processes with computing power. These systems, however, face many challenges, especially regarding security and system faults. Anomalies in CPS may indicate unexpected problems, from sensor malfunctions to cyber-attacks, and must be detected to prevent failures that can cause harm or disrupt services. This paper provides an overview of the different ways researchers have approached anomaly detection in CPS. We categorize and compare methods like machine learning, deep learning, mathematical models, invariant, and hybrid techniques. Our goal is to help readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of these methods and how they can be used to create safer, more reliable CPS. By identifying the gaps in current solutions, we aim to encourage future research that will make CPS more secure and adaptive in our increasingly automated world.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we first demonstrate analytically that double descent does not occur in linear unsupervised autoencoders (AEs). In contrast, we show for the first time that both double and triple descent can be observed with nonlinear AEs across various data models and architectural designs. We examine the effects of partial sample and feature noise and highlight the importance of bottleneck size in influencing the double descent curve. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we uncover model-wise, epoch-wise, and sample-wise double descent across several data types and architectures. Our findings indicate that over-parameterized models not only improve reconstruction but also enhance performance in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and domain adaptation, highlighting their practical value in complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This approach aims to leverage better feature relations by considering the data as coming from different modalities. These data are projected into a shared lower-dimensionality subspace which aims to preserve their inner characteristics. To supplement the previous work on this subject, we introduce novel multimodal graph-embedded regularizers that leverage graph information for every modality to enhance the training process, and we consider an improved training equation that allows us to maximize or minimize each modality according to the specified criteria. We apply this regularized graph-embedded model on a 3-modalities dataset after having generalized MS-SVDD algorithms to any number of modalities. To set up our application, we propose a whole preprocessing procedure to extract One-Class Classification training instances from time-bounded event time series that are used to evaluate both the reliability and earliness of our model for Event Detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, supplementary material</p></details> | None |
| **[Statistically Significant $k$NNAD by Selective Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12978v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection using the k-Nearest Neighbor method. The k-Nearest Neighbor Anomaly Detection (kNNAD) is a simple yet effective approach for identifying anomalies across various domains and fields. A critical challenge in anomaly detection, including kNNAD, is appropriately quantifying the reliability of detected anomalies. To address this, we formulate kNNAD as a statistical hypothesis test and quantify the probability of false detection using $p$-values. The main technical challenge lies in performing both anomaly detection and statistical testing on the same data, which hinders correct $p$-value calculation within the conventional statistical testing framework. To resolve this issue, we introduce a statistical hypothesis testing framework called Selective Inference (SI) and propose a method named Statistically Significant NNAD (Stat-kNNAD). By leveraging SI, the Stat-kNNAD method ensures that detected anomalies are statistically significant with theoretical guarantees. The proposed Stat-kNNAD method is applicable to anomaly detection in both the original feature space and latent feature spaces derived from deep learning models. Through numerical experiments on synthetic data and applications to industrial product anomaly detection, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the Stat-kNNAD method.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures | None |

| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection through Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12793v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in datasets is a longstanding problem in machine learning. In this context, anomalies are defined as a sample that significantly deviates from the remaining data. Meanwhile, optimal transport (OT) is a field of mathematics concerned with the transportation, between two probability measures, at least effort. In classical OT, the optimal transportation strategy of a measure to itself is the identity. In this paper, we tackle anomaly detection by forcing samples to displace its mass, while keeping the least effort objective. We call this new transportation problem Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport (MROT). Naturally, samples lying in low density regions of space will be forced to displace mass very far, incurring a higher transportation cost. We use these concepts to design a new anomaly score. Through a series of experiments in existing benchmarks, and fault detection problems, we show that our algorithm improves over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, under review</p></details> | None |

| **[Unifying Explainable Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12086v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems, prevalent in various scientific and engineering domains, are susceptible to anomalies that can significantly impact their performance and reliability. This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> | None |

Unlike traditional approaches, which address these problems using parameter-sharing, we consider an alternative methodology based on irreducible representations and Schur's lemma. Using this methodology, we obtain an alternative derivation for existing models like DeepSets, 2-IGN graph equivariant networks, and Deep Weight Space (DWS) networks. The derivation for DWS networks is significantly simpler than that of previous results. Next, we extend our approach to unaligned symmetric sets, where equivariance to the wreath product of groups is required. Previous works have addressed this problem in a rather restrictive setting, in which almost all wreath equivariant layers are Siamese. In contrast, we give a full characterization of layers in this case and show that there is a vast number of additional non-Siamese layers in some settings. We also show empirically that these additional non-Siamese layers can improve performance in tasks like graph anomaly detection, weight space alignment, and learning Wasserstein distances.

The scarcity of anomalous samples limits traditional detection methods, making anomaly generation essential for expanding the data repository. However, recent generative models often produce unrealistic anomalies increasing false positives, or require real-world anomaly samples for training. In this work, we treat anomaly generation as a compositional problem and propose ComGEN, a component-aware and unsupervised framework that addresses the gap in logical anomaly generation. Our method comprises a multi-component learning strategy to disentangle visual components, followed by subsequent generation editing procedures. Disentangled text-to-component pairs, revealing intrinsic logical constraints, conduct attention-guided residual mapping and model training with iteratively matched references across multiple scales. Experiments on the MVTecLOCO dataset confirm the efficacy of ComGEN, achieving the best AUROC score of 91.2%. Additional experiments on the real-world scenario of Diesel Engine and widely-used MVTecAD dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements when integrating simulated anomalies generated by ComGEN into automated production workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite CLIP's strong multi-modal data capabilities, it remains limited in specialized environments, such as medical applications. For this purpose, many CLIP variants-i.e., BioMedCLIP, and MedCLIP-SAMv2-have emerged, but false positives related to normal regions persist. Thus, we aim to present a simple yet important goal of reducing false positives in medical anomaly detection. We introduce a Contrastive LAnguage Prompting (CLAP) method that leverages both positive and negative text prompts. This straightforward approach identifies potential lesion regions by visual attention to the positive prompts in the given image. To reduce false positives, we attenuate attention on normal regions using negative prompts. Extensive experiments with the BMAD dataset, including six biomedical benchmarks, demonstrate that CLAP method enhances anomaly detection performance. Our future plans include developing an automated fine prompting method for more practical usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards a Trustworthy Anomaly Detection for Critical Applications through Approximated Partial AUC Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11570v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly Detection is a crucial step for critical applications such in the industrial, medical or cybersecurity domains. These sectors share the same requirement of handling differently the different types of classification errors. Indeed, even if false positives are acceptable, false negatives are not, because it would reflect a missed detection of a quality issue, a disease or a cyber threat. To fulfill this requirement, we propose a method that dynamically applies a trustworthy approximated partial AUC ROC loss (tapAUC). A binary classifier is trained to optimize the specific range of the AUC ROC curve that prevents the True Positive Rate (TPR) to reach 100% while minimizing the False Positive Rate (FPR). The optimal threshold that does not trigger any false negative is then kept and used at the test step. The results show a TPR of 92.52% at a 20.43% FPR for an average across 6 datasets, representing a TPR improvement of 4.3% for a FPR cost of 12.2% against other state-of-the-art methods.
