| **[RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> | None |
| **[A systematic literature review of unsupervised learning algorithms for anomalous traffic detection based on flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08293v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The constant increase of devices connected to the Internet, and therefore of cyber-attacks, makes it necessary to analyze network traffic in order to recognize malicious activity. Traditional packet-based analysis methods are insufficient because in large networks the amount of traffic is so high that it is unfeasible to review all communications. For this reason, flows is a suitable approach for this situation, which in future 5G networks will have to be used, as the number of packets will increase dramatically. If this is also combined with unsupervised learning models, it can detect new threats for which it has not been trained. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on unsupervised learning algorithms for detecting anomalies in network flows, following the PRISMA guideline. A total of 63 scientific articles have been reviewed, analyzing 13 of them in depth. The results obtained show that autoencoder is the most used option, followed by SVM, ALAD, or SOM. On the other hand, all the datasets used for anomaly detection have been collected, including some specialised in IoT or with real data collected from honeypots.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in Logic Journal of the IGPL Published by Oxford University Press</p></details> | None |
| **[Adapting Large Language Models for Parameter-Efficient Log Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08045v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log Anomaly Detection (LAD) seeks to identify atypical patterns in log data that are crucial to assessing the security and condition of systems. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in various fields, the use of LLMs in enabling the detection of log anomalies is largely unexplored. This work aims to fill this gap. Due to the prohibitive costs involved in fully fine-tuning LLMs, we explore the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) for adapting LLMs to LAD. To have an in-depth exploration of the potential of LLM-driven LAD, we present a comprehensive investigation of leveraging two of the most popular PEFTs -- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) -- to tap into three prominent LLMs of varying size, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, and Llama-3, for parameter-efficient LAD. Comprehensive experiments on four public log datasets are performed to reveal important insights into effective LLM-driven LAD in several key perspectives, including the efficacy of these PEFT-based LLM-driven LAD methods, their stability, sample efficiency, robustness w.r.t. unstable logs, and cross-dataset generalization.

| **[What Information Contributes to Log-based Anomaly Detection? Insights from a Configurable Transformer-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20503v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log data are generated from logging statements in the source code, providing insights into the execution processes of software applications and systems. State-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection approaches typically leverage deep learning models to capture the semantic or sequential information in the log data and detect anomalous runtime behaviors. However, the impacts of these different types of information are not clear. In addition, most existing approaches ignore the timestamps in log data, which can potentially provide fine-grained sequential and temporal information. In this work, we propose a configurable Transformer-based anomaly detection model that can capture the semantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data and allows us to configure the different types of information as the model's features. Additionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log sequences of different lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing methods that rely on fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs. With the proposed model, we conduct a series of experiments with different combinations of input features to evaluate the roles of different types of information in anomaly detection. The model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance compared to the baselines when presented with log sequences of varying lengths. The results indicate that the event occurrence information plays a key role in identifying anomalies, while the impact of the sequential and temporal information is not significant for anomaly detection on the studied public datasets. On the other hand, the findings also reveal the simplicity of the studied public datasets and highlight the importance of constructing new datasets that contain different types of anomalies to better evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |
| **[STEAD: Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection for Time and Compute Sensitive Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07942v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new method for anomaly detection in automated systems with time and compute sensitive requirements, such as autonomous driving, with unparalleled efficiency. As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

| **[Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</p></details> |  | None |

Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception~(ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine~(SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 3.2\% and 13.1\%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</p></details> | AAAI2025 Poster | None |
| **[ECNN: A Low-complex, Adjustable CNN for Industrial Pump Monitoring Using Vibration Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07401v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial pumps are essential components in various sectors, such as manufacturing, energy production, and water treatment, where their failures can cause significant financial and safety risks. Anomaly detection can be used to reduce those risks and increase reliability. In this work, we propose a novel enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) to predict the failure of an industrial pump based on the vibration data captured by an acceleration sensor. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed with a focus on low complexity to enable its implementation on edge devices with limited computational resources. Therefore, a detailed design space exploration is performed to find a topology satisfying the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Moreover, to allow for adaptation to unknown pumps, our algorithm features a pump-specific parameter that can be determined by a small set of normal data samples. Finally, we combine the ECNN with a threshold approach to further increase the performance and satisfy the application requirements. As a result, our combined approach significantly outperforms a traditional statistical approach and a classical CNN in terms of accuracy. To summarize, this work provides a novel, low-complex, CNN-based algorithm that is enhanced by classical methods to offer high accuracy for anomaly detection of industrial pumps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and to be presented as a poster at the 2025 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)</p></details> | None |
| **[Probabilistic Segmentation for Robust Field of View Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07375v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attacks on sensing and perception threaten the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Security-aware sensor fusion helps mitigate threats but requires accurate field of view (FOV) estimation which has not been evaluated autonomy. To address this gap, we adapt classical computer graphics algorithms to develop the first autonomy-relevant FOV estimators and create the first datasets with ground truth FOV labels. Unfortunately, we find that these approaches are themselves highly vulnerable to attacks on sensing. To improve robustness of FOV estimation against attacks, we propose a learning-based segmentation model that captures FOV features, integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) for uncertainty quantification, and performs anomaly detection on confidence maps. We illustrate through comprehensive evaluations attack resistance and strong generalization across environments. Architecture trade studies demonstrate the model is feasible for real-time deployment in multiple applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[State Frequency Estimation for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03442v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many works have studied the efficacy of state machines for detecting anomalies within NetFlows. These works typically learn a model from unlabeled data and compute anomaly scores for arbitrary traces based on their likelihood of occurrence or how well they fit within the model. However, these methods do not dynamically adapt their scores based on the traces seen at test time. This becomes a problem when an adversary produces seemingly common traces in their attack, causing the model to miss the detection by assigning low anomaly scores. We propose SEQUENT, a new unsupervised approach that uses the state visit frequency of a state machine to adapt its scoring dynamically for anomaly detection. SEQUENT subsequently uses the scores to generate root causes for anomalies. These allow the grouping of alarms and simplify the analysis of anomalies. We evaluate SEQUENT's effectiveness in detecting network anomalies on three publicly available NetFlow datasets and compare its performance against various existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Our evaluation shows promising results for using the state visit frequency of a state machine to detect network anomalies.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |
| **[TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[A Time Series Multitask Framework Integrating a Large Language Model, Pre-Trained Time Series Model, and Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07682v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is crucial in fields like finance, transportation, and industry. However, traditional models often focus solely on temporal features, limiting their ability to capture underlying information. This paper proposes a novel time series multitask framework, called LTM, which integrates temporal features with textual descriptions to enhance analytical and predictive capabilities. LTM combines pre-trained time series model, large language model (LLM), and knowledge graph to tackle time series tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. LTM achieves improved performance with a few trainable parameters. It is very efficient and practical. LTM encodes time series data into patches and enriches user-provided prompts using knowledge graphs to generate enhanced prompts. A novel feature fusion method embeds prompts into each patch encoding, which is processed by a frozen LLM, followed by a feature enhancement module and a time decoder module. During fine-tuning stage, cosine similarity between prompts and temporal patches is integrated into the loss function to boost performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that LTM significantly outperforms existing methods. It provides a robust and versatile solution for time series tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniVAD: A Training-free Unified Model for Few-shot Visual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03342v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify abnormal samples in images that deviate from normal patterns, covering multiple domains, including industrial, logical, and medical fields. Due to the domain gaps between these fields, existing VAD methods are typically tailored to each domain, with specialized detection techniques and model architectures that are difficult to generalize across different domains. Moreover, even within the same domain, current VAD approaches often follow a "one-category-one-model" paradigm, requiring large amounts of normal samples to train class-specific models, resulting in poor generalizability and hindering unified evaluation across domains. To address this issue, we propose a generalized few-shot VAD method, UniVAD, capable of detecting anomalies across various domains, such as industrial, logical, and medical anomalies, with a training-free unified model. UniVAD only needs few normal samples as references during testing to detect anomalies in previously unseen objects, without training on the specific domain. Specifically, UniVAD employs a Contextual Component Clustering ($C^3$) module based on clustering and vision foundation models to segment components within the image accurately, and leverages Component-Aware Patch Matching (CAPM) and Graph-Enhanced Component Modeling (GECM) modules to detect anomalies at different semantic levels, which are aggregated to produce the final detection result. We conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning industrial, logical, and medical fields, and the results demonstrate that UniVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot anomaly detection tasks across multiple domains, outperforming domain-specific anomaly detection models.

This paper introduces a real-world, multivariate time series dataset collected exclusively from a single anonymized engine component (Component X) across a fleet of SCANIA trucks. The dataset includes operational data, repair records, and specifications related to Component X, while maintaining confidentiality through anonymization. It is well-suited for a range of machine learning applications, including classification, regression, survival analysis, and anomaly detection, particularly in predictive maintenance scenarios. The dataset's large population size, diverse features (in the form of histograms and numerical counters), and temporal information make it a unique resource in the field. The objective of releasing this dataset is to give a broad range of researchers the possibility of working with real-world data from an internationally well-known company and introduce a standard benchmark to the predictive maintenance field, fostering reproducible research.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Learning Decision Trees as Amortized Structure Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06985v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building predictive models for tabular data presents fundamental challenges, notably in scaling consistently, i.e., more resources translating to better performance, and generalizing systematically beyond the training data distribution. Designing decision tree models remains especially challenging given the intractably large search space, and most existing methods rely on greedy heuristics, while deep learning inductive biases expect a temporal or spatial structure not naturally present in tabular data. We propose a hybrid amortized structure inference approach to learn predictive decision tree ensembles given data, formulating decision tree construction as a sequential planning problem. We train a deep reinforcement learning (GFlowNet) policy to solve this problem, yielding a generative model that samples decision trees from the Bayesian posterior. We show that our approach, DT-GFN, outperforms state-of-the-art decision tree and deep learning methods on standard classification benchmarks derived from real-world data, robustness to distribution shifts, and anomaly detection, all while yielding interpretable models with shorter description lengths. Samples from the trained DT-GFN model can be ensembled to construct a random forest, and we further show that the performance of scales consistently in ensemble size, yielding ensembles of predictors that continue to generalize systematically.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: $\href{https://github.com/GFNOrg/dt-gfn}{https://github.com/GFNOrg/dt-gfn}$</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/GFNOrg/dt-gfn) |
| **[Task-Oriented Connectivity for Networked Robotics with Generative AI and Semantic Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06771v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of robotics, advanced communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) holds the promise of transforming industries through fully automated and intelligent operations. In this work, we introduce a novel co-working framework for robots that unifies goal-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) with a Generative AI (GenAI)-agent under a semantic-aware network. SemCom prioritizes the exchange of meaningful information among robots and the network, thereby reducing overhead and latency. Meanwhile, the GenAI-agent leverages generative AI models to interpret high-level task instructions, allocate resources, and adapt to dynamic changes in both network and robotic environments. This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification. Simulation results confirm that SemCom significantly reduces data traffic while preserving critical semantic details, and the GenAI-agent ensures task coordination and network adaptation. This synergy provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for modern industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Mamba-based models, with their superior long-range modeling and linear efficiency, have garnered substantial attention. This study pioneers the application of Mamba to multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, presenting MambaAD, which consists of a pre-trained encoder and a Mamba decoder featuring (Locality-Enhanced State Space) LSS modules at multi-scales. The proposed LSS module, integrating parallel cascaded (Hybrid State Space) HSS blocks and multi-kernel convolutions operations, effectively captures both long-range and local information. The HSS block, utilizing (Hybrid Scanning) HS encoders, encodes feature maps into five scanning methods and eight directions, thereby strengthening global connections through the (State Space Model) SSM. The use of Hilbert scanning and eight directions significantly improves feature sequence modeling. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse anomaly detection datasets and seven metrics demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, substantiating the method's effectiveness.

While CLIP shows promise for zero-shot AD tasks due to its strong generalization capabilities, its inherent Anomaly-Unawareness leads to limited discrimination between normal and abnormal features. To address this problem, we propose Anomaly-Aware CLIP (AA-CLIP), which enhances CLIP's anomaly discrimination ability in both text and visual spaces while preserving its generalization capability. AA-CLIP is achieved through a straightforward yet effective two-stage approach: it first creates anomaly-aware text anchors to differentiate normal and abnormal semantics clearly, then aligns patch-level visual features with these anchors for precise anomaly localization. This two-stage strategy, with the help of residual adapters, gradually adapts CLIP in a controlled manner, achieving effective AD while maintaining CLIP's class knowledge. Extensive experiments validate AA-CLIP as a resource-efficient solution for zero-shot AD tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in industrial and medical applications.

| **["Stones from Other Hills can Polish Jade": Zero-shot Anomaly Image Synthesis via Cross-domain Anomaly Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15211v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial image anomaly detection (IAD) is a pivotal topic with huge value. Due to anomaly's nature, real anomalies in a specific modern industrial domain (i.e. domain-specific anomalies) are usually too rare to collect, which severely hinders IAD. Thus, zero-shot anomaly synthesis (ZSAS), which synthesizes pseudo anomaly images without any domain-specific anomaly, emerges as a vital technique for IAD. However, existing solutions are either unable to synthesize authentic pseudo anomalies, or require cumbersome training. Thus, we focus on ZSAS and propose a brand-new paradigm that can realize both authentic and training-free ZSAS. It is based on a chronically-ignored fact: Although domain-specific anomalies are rare, real anomalies from other domains (i.e. cross-domain anomalies) are actually abundant and directly applicable to ZSAS. Specifically, our new ZSAS paradigm makes three-fold contributions: First, we propose a novel method named Cross-domain Anomaly Injection (CAI), which directly exploits cross-domain anomalies to enable highly authentic ZSAS in a training-free manner. Second, to supply CAI with sufficient cross-domain anomalies, we build the first Domain-agnostic Anomaly Dataset within our best knowledge, which provides ZSAS with abundant real anomaly patterns. Third, we propose a CAI-guided Diffusion Mechanism, which further breaks the quantity limit of real anomalies and enable unlimited anomaly synthesis. Our head-to-head comparison with existing ZSAS solutions justifies our paradigm's superior performance for IAD and demonstrates it as an effective and pragmatic ZSAS solution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[When Unsupervised Domain Adaptation meets One-class Anomaly Detection: Addressing the Two-fold Unsupervised Curse by Leveraging Anomaly Scarcity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21022v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first fully unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). The performance of UAD techniques degrades significantly in the presence of a domain shift, difficult to avoid in a real-world setting. While UDA has contributed to solving this issue in binary and multi-class classification, such a strategy is ill-posed in UAD. This might be explained by the unsupervised nature of the two tasks, namely, domain adaptation and anomaly detection. Herein, we first formulate this problem that we call the two-fold unsupervised curse. Then, we propose a pioneering solution to this curse, considered intractable so far, by assuming that anomalies are rare. Specifically, we leverage clustering techniques to identify a dominant cluster in the target feature space. Posed as the normal cluster, the latter is aligned with the source normal features. Concretely, given a one-class source set and an unlabeled target set composed mostly of normal data and some anomalies, we fit the source features within a hypersphere while jointly aligning them with the features of the dominant cluster from the target set. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis on common adaptation benchmarks for anomaly detection, demonstrating the relevance of both the newly introduced paradigm and the proposed approach. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Swift Hydra: Self-Reinforcing Generative Framework for Anomaly Detection with Multiple Mamba Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06413v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite a plethora of anomaly detection models developed over the years, their ability to generalize to unseen anomalies remains an issue, particularly in critical systems. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing Swift Hydra, a new framework for training an anomaly detection method based on generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL). Through featuring an RL policy that operates on the latent variables of a generative model, the framework synthesizes novel and diverse anomaly samples that are capable of bypassing a detection model. These generated synthetic samples are, in turn, used to augment the detection model, further improving its ability to handle challenging anomalies. Swift Hydra also incorporates Mamba models structured as a Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enable scalable adaptation of the number of Mamba experts based on data complexity, effectively capturing diverse feature distributions without increasing the model's inference time. Empirical evaluations on ADBench benchmark demonstrate that Swift Hydra outperforms other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models while maintaining a relatively short inference time. From these results, our research highlights a new and auspicious paradigm of integrating RL and generative AI for advancing anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accurate and Efficient Two-Stage Gun Detection in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06317v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in videos plays a crucial role in advancing applications such as public safety and anomaly detection. Existing methods have explored different techniques, including CNN, deep learning, and Transformers, for object detection and video classification. However, detecting tiny objects, e.g., guns, in videos remains challenging due to their small scale and varying appearances in complex scenes. Moreover, existing video analysis models for classification or detection often perform poorly in real-world gun detection scenarios due to limited labeled video datasets for training. Thus, developing efficient methods for effectively capturing tiny object features and designing models capable of accurate gun detection in real-world videos is imperative. To address these challenges, we make three original contributions in this paper. First, we conduct an empirical study of several existing video classification and object detection methods to identify guns in videos. Our extensive analysis shows that these methods may not accurately detect guns in videos. Second, we propose a novel two-stage gun detection method. In stage 1, we train an image-augmented model to effectively classify ``Gun'' videos. To make the detection more precise and efficient, stage 2 employs an object detection model to locate the exact region of the gun within video frames for videos classified as ``Gun'' by stage 1. Third, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific method achieves significant performance improvements and enhances efficiency compared with existing techniques.

Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main) |

In practice training data lack those anomalous samples; hence state-of-the-art methods are trained to discriminate between normal and synthetically-generated pseudo-anomalous data. Most methods use data augmentation techniques on normal images to simulate anomalies. However the best-performing ones implicitly leverage a geometric bias present in the benchmarking datasets. This limits their usability in more general conditions. Others are relying on basic noising schemes that may be suboptimal in capturing the underlying structure of normal data. In addition most still favour the image domain to generate pseudo-anomalies training models end-to-end from only the normal class and overlooking richer representations of the information. To overcome these limitations we consider frozen yet rich feature spaces given by pretrained models and create pseudo-anomalous features with a novel adaptive linear feature perturbation technique. It adapts the noise distribution to each sample applies decaying linear perturbations to feature vectors and further guides the classification process using a contrastive learning objective. Experimental evaluation conducted on both standard and geometric bias-free datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach with respect to comparable baselines. The codebase is accessible via our public repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in WACV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Spectral-Spatial Extraction through Layered Tensor Decomposition for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05183v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low rank tensor representation (LRTR) methods are very useful for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD). To overcome the limitations that they often overlook spectral anomaly and rely on large-scale matrix singular value decomposition, we first apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to alleviate spectral dimensionality redundancy and extract spectral anomaly and then employ LRTR to extract spatial anomaly while mitigating spatial redundancy, yielding a highly efffcient layered tensor decomposition (LTD) framework for HAD. An iterative algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization is developed to solve the proposed LTD model, with convergence guarantees provided. Moreover, we introduce a rank reduction strategy with validation mechanism that adaptively reduces data size while preventing excessive reduction. Theoretically, we rigorously establish the equivalence between the tensor tubal rank and tensor group sparsity regularization (TGSR) and, under mild conditions, demonstrate that the relaxed formulation of TGSR shares the same global minimizers and optimal values as its original counterpart. Experimental results on the Airport-Beach-Urban and MVTec datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the HAD task.</p></details> |  | None |

Research on anomaly detection approaches is constrained by the availability of datasets that represent complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical to industrial processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of the methods' applicability to real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. In addition to the evaluation of defect detection performance of recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training approach, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Even small amounts of injected real defects prove beneficial for model generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Research findings indicate that supervision by means of both synthetic and accumulated real defects can complement each other, meeting demanded industrial inspection requirements such as low false positive rates and high recall. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures, this preprint has been submitted to the Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing</p></details> | None |

Confiscated seashells, cannot be returned to their ecosystems due to the lack of origin recognition. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically for seashell identification. We built a dataset from scratch, consisting of approximately 19000 images from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Using this dataset, the model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding 85%. The model has been integrated into a user-friendly application, which has classified over 36,000 seashells to date, delivering real-time results within 3 seconds per image. To further enhance the system's accuracy, an anomaly detection mechanism was incorporated to filter out irrelevant or anomalous inputs, ensuring only valid seashell images are processed.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets.

Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We apply it to create a background data template for weakly-supervised searches at the LHC. The method smoothly transforms sideband events to match signal region mass distributions. We demonstrate the performance of TRANSIT using the LHC Olympics R\&D dataset. The model captures non-linear mass correlations of features and produces a template that offers a competitive anomaly sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art transport-based template generators. Moreover, the computational training time required for TRANSIT is an order of magnitude lower than that of competing deep learning methods. This makes it ideal for analyses that iterate over many signal regions and signal models. Unlike generative models, which must learn a full probability density distribution, i.e., the correlations between all the variables, the proposed transport model only has to learn a smooth conditional shift of the distribution. This allows for a simpler, more efficient residual architecture, enabling mass uncorrelated features to pass the network unchanged while the mass correlated features are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, we show that the latent space of the model provides a set of mass decorrelated features useful for anomaly detection without background sculpting.</p></details> | 34 pages, 14 figures | None |

This imbalance, rooted in logic and the theory of recursive modelling frameworks, cannot be solved directly. We propose a computational framework, $\aleph$-IPOMDP, augmenting model-based RL agents' Bayesian inference with an anomaly detection algorithm and an out-of-belief policy. Our mechanism allows agents to realize they are being deceived, even if they cannot understand how, and to deter opponents via a credible threat. We test this framework in both a mixed-motive and zero-sum game. Our results show the $\aleph$ mechanism's effectiveness, leading to more equitable outcomes and less exploitation by more sophisticated agents. We discuss implications for AI safety, cybersecurity, cognitive science, and psychiatry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

The number of information security events generated by information security tools grows up with the development of the IT infrastructure. At the same time, the cyber threat landscape does not remain constant, and monitoring should take into account both already known attack indicators and those for which there are no signature rules in information security products of various classes yet. Detecting anomalies in large cybersecurity data streams is a complex task that, if properly addressed, can allow for timely response to atypical and previously unknown cyber threats. The possibilities of using of offline algorithms may be limited for a number of reasons related to the time of training and the frequency of retraining. Using stream learning algorithms for solving this task is capable of providing near-real-time data processing. This article examines the results of ten algorithms from three Python stream machine-learning libraries on BETH dataset with cybersecurity events, which contains information about the creation, cloning, and destruction of operating system processes collected using extended eBPF. ROC-AUC metric and total processing time of processing with these algorithms are presented. Several combinations of features and the order of events are considered. In conclusion, some mentions are given about the most promising algorithms and possible directions for further research are outlined.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional approaches, which address these problems using parameter-sharing, we consider an alternative methodology based on irreducible representations and Schur's lemma. Using this methodology, we obtain an alternative derivation for existing models like DeepSets, 2-IGN graph equivariant networks, and Deep Weight Space (DWS) networks. The derivation for DWS networks is significantly simpler than that of previous results. Next, we extend our approach to unaligned symmetric sets, where equivariance to the wreath product of groups is required. Previous works have addressed this problem in a rather restrictive setting, in which almost all wreath equivariant layers are Siamese. In contrast, we give a full characterization of layers in this case and show that there is a vast number of additional non-Siamese layers in some settings. We also show empirically that these additional non-Siamese layers can improve performance in tasks like graph anomaly detection, weight space alignment, and learning Wasserstein distances.

Existing machine learning models often rely only on a single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore, task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and security tasks. To address these gaps, we propose UniNet, a unified framework that introduces a novel multi-granular traffic representation (T-Matrix), integrating session, flow, and packet-level features to provide comprehensive contextual information. Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks. Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification, and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and improved scalability. By addressing the limitations of single-level models and unifying traffic analysis paradigms, UniNet sets a new benchmark for modern network security.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures,15 tables</p></details> | None |

The long-term goal of Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is to enable machines to autonomously replicate this skill. However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality. We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies. Additionally, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Explanation (PAEval) metric, designed to assess the ability of visual-language foundation models to not only detect anomalies but also provide accurate explanations for their underlying physical causes.

In air disc brake manufacturing, ensuring the precision of laser-engraved nameplates is crucial for accurate product identification and quality control.

However, the heterogeneous nature of IoT data and the lack of human-comprehensible insights from anomaly detection models remain significant challenges. This paper presents a hybrid framework that combines numerical anomaly detection using Autoencoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced preprocessing and interpretability. Two preprocessing approaches are implemented: a traditional method utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and an LLM-assisted method where GPT-4 dynamically recommends feature selection, transformation, and encoding strategies. Experimental results on the KDDCup99 10% corrected dataset demonstrate that the LLM-assisted preprocessing pipeline significantly improves anomaly detection performance. The macro-average F1 score increased from 0.49 in the traditional PCA-based approach to 0.98 with LLM-driven insights. Additionally, the LLM generates natural language explanations for detected anomalies, providing contextual insights into their causes and implications. This framework highlights the synergy between numerical AI models and LLMs, delivering an accurate, interpretable, and efficient solution for IoT cybersecurity in critical infrastructure.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they remain vulnerable due to the absence of robust security mechanisms in the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. In order to mitigate the security issue, many machine learning models and strategies have been proposed, which primarily focus on a subset of dominant patterns of anomalies and lack rigorous evaluation in terms of reliability and robustness. Therefore, to address the limitations of previous works and mitigate the security vulnerability in CAN bus, the current study develops a model based on the intrinsic nature of the problem to cover all dominant patterns of anomalies. To achieve this, a cascade feature-level fusion strategy optimized by a two-parameter genetic algorithm is proposed to combine temporal and spatial information. Subsequently, the model is evaluated using a paired t-test to ensure reliability and robustness. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis conducted on two widely used datasets advocates that the proposed model outperforms other models and achieves superior accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating the best performance among all models presented to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: u...</summary><p>v2: updated the text and graphs</p></details> | None |

However, deploying these models on edge devices presents significant challenges, such as constrained computational and memory resources. Additionally, dynamic data distributions in real-world settings necessitate continuous model adaptation, further complicating deployment under limited resources. To address these challenges, we present a novel investigation into the problem of Continual Learning for Visual Anomaly Detection (CLAD) on edge devices. We evaluate the STFPM approach, given its low memory footprint on edge devices, which demonstrates good performance when combined with the Replay approach. Furthermore, we propose to study the behavior of a recently proposed approach, PaSTe, specifically designed for the edge but not yet explored in the Continual Learning context. Our results show that PaSTe is not only a lighter version of STPFM, but it also achieves superior anomaly detection performance, improving the f1 pixel performance by 10% with the Replay technique. In particular, the structure of PaSTe allows us to test it using a series of Compressed Replay techniques, reducing memory overhead by a maximum of 91.5% compared to the traditional Replay for STFPM. Our study proves the feasibility of deploying VAD models that adapt and learn incrementally on CLAD scenarios on resource-constrained edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |

Using simulations of a swarm's normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment. During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antagonistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion correctly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally, the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the detection criterion are increased.</p></details> | reduced file size | None |

Despite their significance, there has been little systematic and empirical research on this concept due to issues of measurement and operationalization. We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in two scenarios: first, supplementing an initial list of media storms within a specific time frame; and second, detecting media storms in new time periods. We make available a media storm dataset compiled using both scenarios. Both the method and dataset offer the basis for comprehensive empirical research into the concept of media storms, including characterizing them and predicting their outbursts and durations, in mainstream media or social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted and published in Findings of EMNLP 2024.

We explore how state-of-the-art world models in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning can be utilized beyond the training phase to ensure a deployed policy only operates within regions of the state-space it is sufficiently familiar with. This is achieved by continuously monitoring discrepancies between a world model's predictions and observed system behavior during inference. It allows for triggering appropriate measures, such as an emergency stop, once an error threshold is surpassed. This does not require any task-specific knowledge and is thus universally applicable. Simulated experiments on established robot control tasks show the effectiveness of this method, recognizing changes in local robot geometry and global gravitational magnitude. Real-world experiments using an agile quadcopter further demonstrate the benefits of this approach by detecting unexpected forces acting on the vehicle. These results indicate how even in new and adverse conditions, safe and reliable operation of otherwise unpredictable learning-based controllers can be achieved.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UMGAD: Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12556v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a critical task in graph machine learning, with the primary objective of identifying anomalous nodes that deviate significantly from the majority. This task is widely applied in various real-world scenarios, including fraud detection and social network analysis. However, existing GAD methods still face two major challenges: (1) They are often limited to detecting anomalies in single-type interaction graphs and struggle with multiple interaction types in multiplex heterogeneous graphs. (2) In unsupervised scenarios, selecting appropriate anomaly score thresholds remains a significant challenge for accurate anomaly detection. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection method, named UMGAD. We first learn multi-relational correlations among nodes in multiplex heterogeneous graphs and capture anomaly information during node attribute and structure reconstruction through graph-masked autoencoder (GMAE). Then, to further extract abnormal information, we generate attribute-level and subgraph-level augmented-view graphs respectively, and perform attribute and structure reconstruction through GMAE. Finally, we learn to optimize node attributes and structural features through contrastive learning between original-view and augmented-view graphs to improve the model's ability to capture anomalies. Meanwhile, we also propose a new anomaly score threshold selection strategy, which allows the model to be independent of ground truth information in real unsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that our UMGAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 13.48% in AUC and 11.68% in Macro-F1 across all datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Intrinsic Normal Prototypes within a Single Image for Universal Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02424v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-Guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class, and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability.

We establish the Fence Theorem, formalizing preprocessing as a dual-objective semantic isolator: (1) mitigating cross-semantic interference to the greatest extent feasible and (2) confining anomaly judgments to aligned semantic spaces wherever viable, thereby establishing intra-semantic comparability. Any preprocessing approach achieves this goal through a two-stage process of Emantic-Division and Spatial-Constraints stage. Through systematic deconstruction, we theoretically and experimentally subsume existing preprocessing methods under this theorem via tripartite evidence: qualitative analyses, quantitative studies, and mathematical proofs. Guided by the Fence Theorem, we implement Patch3D, consisting of Patch-Cutting and Patch-Matching modules, to segment semantic spaces and consolidate similar ones while independently modeling normal features within each space. Experiments on Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD with different settings demonstrate that progressively finer-grained semantic alignment in preprocessing directly enhances point-level AD accuracy, providing inverse validation of the theorem's causal logic.</p></details> |  | None |

This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard <10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches, such as distance, density, or cluster-based methods, face significant challenges when applied to high dimensional tensor data, where complex interdependencies across dimensions amplify noise and computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper leverages Tensor Chidori pseudoskeleton decomposition within a tensor-robust principal component analysis framework to extract low Tucker rank structure while isolating sparse anomalies, ensuring robustness to anomaly detection. We establish theoretical results regarding convergence, and estimation error, demonstrating the stability and accuracy of the proposed approach. Numerical experiments on real-world spatiotemporal data from New York City taxi trip records validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting anomalous urban events compared to existing benchmark methods. Our results suggest that tensor pseudoskeleton decomposition may offer potential for enhancing anomaly detection in large-scale, high-dimensional data.</p></details> |  | None |

Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

| **[Building Machine Learning Challenges for Anomaly Detection in Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02112v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discoveries are often made by finding a pattern or object that was not predicted by the known rules of science. Oftentimes, these anomalous events or objects that do not conform to the norms are an indication that the rules of science governing the data are incomplete, and something new needs to be present to explain these unexpected outliers. The challenge of finding anomalies can be confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge of the known scientific behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on the data to look for deviations. When utilizing machine learning, this presents a particular challenge since we require that the model not only understands scientific data perfectly but also recognizes when the data is inconsistent and out of the scope of its trained behavior. In this paper, we present three datasets aimed at developing machine learning-based anomaly detection for disparate scientific domains covering astrophysics, genomics, and polar science. We present the different datasets along with a scheme to make machine learning challenges around the three datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we present an approach that generalizes to future machine learning challenges, enabling the possibility of large, more compute-intensive challenges that can ultimately lead to scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages 6 figures to be submitted to Nature Communications</p></details> | None |

However, current GAD methods largely overlook the fairness problem, which might result in discriminatory decisions skewed toward certain demographic groups defined on sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.). This greatly limits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios in light of societal and ethical restrictions. To address this critical gap, we make the first attempt to integrate fairness with utility in GAD decision-making. Specifically, we devise a novel DisEntangle-based FairnEss-aware aNomaly Detection framework on the attributed graph, named DEFEND. DEFEND first introduces disentanglement in GNNs to capture informative yet sensitive-irrelevant node representations, effectively reducing societal bias inherent in graph representation learning. Besides, to alleviate discriminatory bias in evaluating anomalous nodes, DEFEND adopts a reconstruction-based anomaly detection, which concentrates solely on node attributes without incorporating any graph structure. Additionally, given the inherent association between input and sensitive attributes, DEFEND constrains the correlation between the reconstruction error and the predicted sensitive attributes. Our empirical evaluations on real-world datasets reveal that DEFEND performs effectively in GAD and significantly enhances fairness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

This approach significantly improves the models capability to distinguish between normal and defective conditions. Our results of experiments conducted on well known MVTec and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only excels in environments with substantial noise but can also contribute in case of a clear training set, isolating those samples that are relatively out of distribution, thus offering significant improvements over traditional models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the VISION workshop at ECCV 2024</p></details> | None |

However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental results show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6% across four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common ECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each of these tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards a General Time Series Anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15273v4)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.

Traditional approaches often struggle with high false-positive rates, frequently misclassifying normal shadows and surface deformations as defects, an issue that becomes particularly pronounced in products with complex and intricate surface features. To address these challenges, we introduce PA-CLIP, a zero-shot anomaly detection method that reduces background noise and enhances defect detection through a pseudo-anomaly-based framework. The proposed method integrates a multiscale feature aggregation strategy for capturing detailed global and local information, two memory banks for distinguishing background information, including normal patterns and pseudo-anomalies, from true anomaly features, and a decision-making module designed to minimize false positives caused by environmental variations while maintaining high defect sensitivity. Demonstrated on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, PA-CLIP outperforms existing zero-shot methods, providing a robust solution for industrial defect detection.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |
| **[OIPR: Evaluation for Time-series Anomaly Detection Inspired by Operator Interest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01260v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of time-series anomaly detection (TAD) technology, numerous studies have employed deep learning-based detectors for analyzing time-series data in the fields of Internet services, industrial systems, and sensors. The selection and optimization of anomaly detectors strongly rely on the availability of an effective performance evaluation method for TAD. Since anomalies in time-series data often manifest as a sequence of points, conventional metrics that solely consider the detection of individual point are inadequate. Existing evaluation methods for TAD typically employ point-based or event-based metrics to capture the temporal context. However, point-based metrics tend to overestimate detectors that excel only in detecting long anomalies, while event-based metrics are susceptible to being misled by fragmented detection results. To address these limitations, we propose OIPR, a novel set of TAD evaluation metrics. It models the process of operators receiving detector alarms and handling faults, utilizing area under the operator interest curve to evaluate the performance of TAD algorithms. Furthermore, we build a special scenario dataset to compare the characteristics of different evaluation methods. Through experiments conducted on the special scenario dataset and five real-world datasets, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of OIPR in extreme and complex scenarios. It achieves a balance between point and event perspectives, overcoming their primary limitations and offering applicability to broader situations.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurately modeling the boundary of normality is crucial for distinguishing abnormal data, but this is often challenging due to limited data or the presence of nuisance attributes. While unsupervised methods that rely solely on data without user guidance are common, they may fail to detect anomalies of specific interest. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Assisted Feature Transformation (LAFT), which leverages the shared image-text embedding space of vision-language models to transform visual features according to user-defined requirements. Combined with anomaly detection methods, LAFT effectively aligns visual features with user preferences, allowing anomalies of interest to be detected. Extensive experiments on both toy and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

Traditional health management methods, relying on expert identification or simple rule-based algorithms, struggle to cope with the dynamic heterogeneous networks (DHNs) environment. Moreover, current state-of-the-art distributed anomaly detection methods, which utilize specific machine learning techniques, lack multi-scale adaptivity for heterogeneous device information, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy for DHNs. In this paper, we develop an LLM-assisted end-to-end intelligent network health management framework. The framework first proposes a Multi-Scale Semanticized Anomaly Detection Model (MSADM), incorporating semantic rule trees with an attention mechanism to address the multi-scale anomaly detection problem in DHNs. Secondly, a chain-of-thought-based large language model is embedded in downstream to adaptively analyze the fault detection results and produce an analysis report with detailed fault information and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our proposed MSADM for heterogeneous network entity anomaly detection is as high as 91.31\%.</p></details> |  | None |

How can we identify multiple types of intrusions and capture their characteristic behaviors? The tensor data consists of categorical and continuous attributes and the data distributions of continuous attributes typically exhibit skew. These data properties require handling skewed infinite and finite dimensional spaces simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel streaming method, namely CyberCScope. The method effectively decomposes incoming tensors into major trends while explicitly distinguishing between categorical and skewed continuous attributes. To our knowledge, it is the first to compute hybrid skewed infinite and finite dimensional decomposition. Based on this decomposition, it streamingly finds distinct time-evolving patterns, enabling the detection of multiple types of anomalies. Extensive experiments on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that CyberCScope detects various intrusions with higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while providing meaningful summaries for the intrusions that occur in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 short research paper</p></details> | None |

Consequently, self-supervised anomaly detection (SSAD) has seen a recent surge of interest, since SSL is especially attractive for unsupervised tasks. However, recent works have reported that the choice of a data augmentation function has significant impact on the accuracy of SSAD, posing augmentation search as an essential but nontrivial problem with the lack of labeled validation data. In this paper, we introduce ST-SSAD, the first systematic approach for rigorous augmentation tuning on SSAD. To this end, our work presents two key contributions. The first is a new unsupervised validation loss that quantifies the alignment between augmented training data and unlabeled validation data. The second is new differentiable augmentation functions, allowing data augmentation hyperparameter(s) to be tuned in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two testbeds with semantic class anomalies and subtle industrial defects show that ST-SSAD gives significant performance gains over existing works.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

This innovative method revolutionizes healthcare by facilitating early disease detection and tailored care, particularly in chronic disease management, where IoMT automates treatments based on real-time health data collection. Nonetheless, its benefits are countered by significant security challenges that endanger the lives of its users due to the sensitivity and value of the processed data, thereby attracting malicious interests. Moreover, the utilization of wireless communication for data transmission exposes medical data to interception and tampering by cybercriminals. Additionally, anomalies may arise due to human error, network interference, or hardware malfunctions. In this context, anomaly detection based on Machine Learning (ML) is an interesting solution, but it comes up against obstacles in terms of explicability and privacy protection. To address these challenges, a new framework for Intrusion Detection Systems is introduced, leveraging Artificial Neural Networks for intrusion detection while utilizing Federated Learning (FL) for privacy preservation. Additionally, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods are incorporated to enhance model explanation and interpretation. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated and compared with centralized approaches using multiple datasets containing network and medical data, simulating various attack types impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical and physiological data. The results obtained offer compelling evidence that the FL method performs comparably to the centralized method, demonstrating high performance.

Most research assumes ideal closed-set environments. However, in real-world open-set environments, graph learning models face challenges in robustness and reliability due to unseen classes. This highlights the need for Graph Open-Set Recognition (GOSR) methods to address these issues and ensure effective GNN application in practical scenarios. Research in GOSR is in its early stages, with a lack of a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse tasks and datasets to evaluate methods. Moreover, traditional methods, Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection (GOODD), GOSR, and Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) have mostly evolved in isolation, with little exploration of their interconnections or potential applications to GOSR. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textbf{G-OSR}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GOSR methods at both the node and graph levels, using datasets from multiple domains to ensure fair and standardized comparisons of effectiveness and efficiency across traditional, GOODD, GOSR, and GAD methods. The results offer critical insights into the generalizability and limitations of current GOSR methods and provide valuable resources for advancing research in this field through systematic analysis of diverse approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages,2 figures | None |

VGS generates samples from a given unnormalized density (i.e., energy) by drifting and diffusing randomly initialized particles. In VGS, finding the optimal drift is equivalent to solving an optimal control problem where the cost is the upper bound of the KL divergence between the target density and the samples. We employ value-based dynamic programming to solve this optimal control problem, which gives the gradient of the value function as the optimal drift vector. The connection to sequential decision making allows VGS to leverage extensively studied techniques in reinforcement learning, making VGS a fast, adaptive, and accurate sampler that achieves competitive results in various sampling benchmarks. Furthermore, VGS can replace MCMC in contrastive divergence training of energy-based models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VGS in training accurate energy-based models in industrial anomaly detection applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/swyoon/value-gradient-sampler/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/swyoon/value-gradient-sampler) |

Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> | None |
| **[FedDyMem: Efficient Federated Learning with Dynamic Memory and Memory-Reduce for Unsupervised Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21012v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised image anomaly detection (UAD) has become a critical process in industrial and medical applications, but it faces growing challenges due to increasing concerns over data privacy. The limited class diversity inherent to one-class classification tasks, combined with distribution biases caused by variations in products across and within clients, poses significant challenges for preserving data privacy with federated UAD. Thus, this article proposes an efficient federated learning method with dynamic memory and memory-reduce for unsupervised image anomaly detection, called FedDyMem. Considering all client data belongs to a single class (i.e., normal sample) in UAD and the distribution of intra-class features demonstrates significant skewness, FedDyMem facilitates knowledge sharing between the client and server through the client's dynamic memory bank instead of model parameters. In the local clients, a memory generator and a metric loss are employed to improve the consistency of the feature distribution for normal samples, leveraging the local model to update the memory bank dynamically. For efficient communication, a memory-reduce method based on weighted averages is proposed to significantly decrease the scale of memory banks. On the server, global memory is constructed and distributed to individual clients through k-means aggregation. Experiments conducted on six industrial and medical datasets, comprising a mixture of six products or health screening types derived from eleven public datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDyMem.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, we propose a Distribution Prototype Diffusion Learning (DPDL) method aimed at enclosing normal samples within a compact and discriminative distribution space. Specifically, we construct multiple learnable Gaussian prototypes to create a latent representation space for abundant and diverse normal samples and learn a Schr\"odinger bridge to facilitate a diffusive transition toward these prototypes for normal samples while steering anomaly samples away. Moreover, to enhance inter-sample separation, we design a dispersion feature learning way in hyperspherical space, which benefits the identification of out-of-distribution anomalies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DPDL, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Background-Aware Defect Generation for Robust Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16767v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in industrial settings is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled anomalous data. Generative models can mitigate this issue by synthesizing realistic defect samples, but existing approaches often fail to model the crucial interplay between defects and their background. This oversight leads to unrealistic anomalies, especially in scenarios where contextual consistency is essential (i.e., logical anomaly). To address this, we propose a novel background-aware defect generation framework, where the background influences defect denoising without affecting the background itself by ensuring realistic synthesis while preserving structural integrity. Our method leverages a disentanglement loss to separate the background' s denoising process from the defect, enabling controlled defect synthesis through DDIM Inversion. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach maintains background fidelity while generating contextually accurate defects. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and MVTec Loco benchmarks validate our mehtod's superiority over existing techniques in both defect generation quality and anomaly detection performance.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[One-for-More: Continual Diffusion Model for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19848v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of generative models, there is a growing interest in unifying all tasks within a generative framework. Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and ``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of ``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model. For continual anomaly detection, ours achieves first place in 17/18 settings on MVTec and VisA.

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations.

Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem, extending traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan aeroengine degradation. TDC-AE outperforms LSTMs and Transformers while achieving a 200x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust, interpretable signal for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HDM: Hybrid Diffusion Model for Unified Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19200v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image anomaly detection plays a vital role in applications such as industrial quality inspection and medical imaging, where it directly contributes to improving product quality and system reliability. However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data. The complete TSQA dataset, models, executable codes, user study questionnaires for evaluation, and results have all been open-sourced.</p></details> |  | None |

Initially introduced to define a center-outward ordering of points in the support of a multivariate distribution, depth functions permit to generalize the notions of quantiles and (signed) ranks for observations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d>1$, as well as statistical procedures based on such quantities. Here we develop a general theoretical framework for evaluating the depth of a Markov sample path and recovering it statistically from an estimate of its transition probability with (non-) asymptotic guarantees. We also detail some of its applications, focusing particularly on unsupervised anomaly detection. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, numerical experiments are displayed, providing empirical evidence of the relevance of the novel concept we introduce here to quantify the degree of abnormality of Markov paths of variable length.</p></details> |  | None |

With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  | None |

We apply two methods, cluster analysis and anomaly detection models, to identify operational disruptions with geographical patterns in the NAS since 2010. We identify four types and twelve categories of days of operations, distinguished according to air traffic system operational performance and geographical patterns of disruptions. Two clusters--NAS Disruption and East Super Disruption, accounting for 0.8% and 1.2% of the days respectively, represent the most disrupted days of operations in U.S. air traffic system. Another 16.5% of days feature less severe but still significant disruptions focused on certain regions of the NAS, while on the remaining 81.5% of days the NAS operates relatively smoothly. Anomaly detection results show good agreement with cluster results and further distinguish days in the same cluster by severity of disruptions. Results show an increasing trend in frequency of disruptions especially post-COVID. Additionally, disruptions happen most frequently in the summer and winter.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 13 Figures, submitted to ATRDS</p></details> | None |

Consequently, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data has emerged as an essential task to maintain the reliability and robustness of data-driven models, in general, and machine and deep learning models, in particular. In this study, we leveraged the convex hull property of a dataset and the fact that anomalies highly contribute to the increase of the CH's volume to propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm. Our algorithm computes the CH's volume as an increasing number of data points are removed from the dataset to define a decision line between OOD and in-distribution data points. We compared the proposed algorithm to seven widely used anomaly detection algorithms over ten datasets, showing comparable results for state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Moreover, we show that with a computationally cheap and simple check, one can detect datasets that are well-suited for the proposed algorithm which outperforms the SOTA anomaly detection algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there are several issues that must be addressed, such as the fact that their ability to capture long-term dependencies is not completely reliable, their computational complexity levels are high, and the spatiotemporal features of WSN timing data are not sufficiently extracted for detecting the correlation anomalies of multinode WSN timing data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a WSN anomaly detection method that integrates frequency-domain features with dynamic graph neural networks (GNN) under a designed self-encoder reconstruction framework. First, the discrete wavelet transform effectively decomposes trend and seasonal components of time series to solve the poor long-term reliability of transformers. Second, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to make full use of the difference between the amplitude distributions of normal data and anomalous data in this domain. Finally, a multimodal fusion-based dynamic graph convolutional network (MFDGCN) is designed by combining an attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to adaptively extract spatial correlation features. A series of experiments conducted on public datasets and their results demonstrate that the anomaly detection method designed in this paper exhibits superior precision and recall than the existing methods do, with an F1 score of 93.5%, representing an improvement of 2.9% over that of the existing models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios.

Currently, only global and simplified eye movement trajectories are employed to approximate the complex and hidden kinematic relationships of the oculomotor function. Recent advances on machine learning and video analysis have encouraged novel characterizations of eye movement patterns to quantify PD. These schemes enable the identification of spatiotemporal segments primarily associated with PD. However, they rely on discriminative models that require large training datasets and depend on balanced class distributions. This work introduces a novel video analysis scheme to quantify Parkinsonian eye fixation patterns with an anomaly detection framework. Contrary to classical deep discriminative schemes that learn differences among labeled classes, the proposed approach is focused on one-class learning, avoiding the necessity of a significant amount of data. The proposed approach focuses only on Parkinson's representation, considering any other class sample as an anomaly of the distribution. This approach was evaluated for an ocular fixation task, in a total of 13 control subjects and 13 patients on different stages of the disease. The proposed digital biomarker achieved an average sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.63, respectively, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.95.

However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies.
