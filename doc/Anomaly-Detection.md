| **[APT-LLM: Embedding-Based Anomaly Detection of Cyber Advanced Persistent Threats Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09385v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth and ability to mimic normal system behavior, making detection particularly difficult in highly imbalanced datasets. Traditional anomaly detection methods struggle to effectively differentiate APT-related activities from benign processes, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces APT-LLM, a novel embedding-based anomaly detection framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) -- BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa -- with autoencoder architectures to detect APTs. Unlike prior approaches, which rely on manually engineered features or conventional anomaly detection models, APT-LLM leverages LLMs to encode process-action provenance traces into semantically rich embeddings, capturing nuanced behavioral patterns. These embeddings are analyzed using three autoencoder architectures -- Baseline Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) -- to model normal process behavior and identify anomalies. The best-performing model is selected for comparison against traditional methods. The framework is evaluated on real-world, highly imbalanced provenance trace datasets from the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data across multiple operating systems (Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows) and attack scenarios. Results demonstrate that APT-LLM significantly improves detection performance under extreme imbalance conditions, outperforming existing anomaly detection methods and highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based feature extraction in cybersecurity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09254v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

In the realm of open radio access networks (O-RAN), characterized by their disaggregated architecture and heterogeneous components from multiple vendors, the deployment of generative models offers significant advantages for network management such as traffic analysis, traffic forecasting and anomaly detection. However, the complex and dynamic nature of O-RAN introduces challenges that necessitate not only accurate detection mechanisms but also reduced complexity, scalability, and most importantly interpretability to facilitate effective network management. In this study, we introduce the XAInomaly framework, an explainable and interpretable Semi-supervised (SS) Deep Contractive Autoencoder (DeepCAE) design for anomaly detection in O-RAN. Our approach leverages the generative modeling capabilities of our SS-DeepCAE model to learn compressed, robust representations of normal network behavior, which captures essential features, enabling the identification of deviations indicative of anomalies. To address the black-box nature of deep learning models, we propose reactive Explainable AI (XAI) technique called fastshap-C.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 Figures, Submitted to Journal (First revision completed)</p></details> | None |
| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Implicit Shape representations for Sarcopenia Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09088v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcopenia is an age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and strength that significantly impacts daily life. A commonly studied criterion for characterizing the muscle mass has been the combination of 3D imaging and manual segmentations. In this paper, we instead study the muscles' shape. We rely on an implicit neural representation (INR) to model normal muscle shapes. We then introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection method to identify sarcopenic muscles based on the reconstruction error of the implicit model. Relying on a conditional INR with an auto-decoding strategy, we also learn a latent representation of the muscles that clearly separates normal from abnormal muscles in an unsupervised fashion. Experimental results on a dataset of 103 segmented volumes indicate that our double anomaly detection strategy effectively discriminates sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic muscles.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive NAD: Online and Self-adaptive Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22967v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

| **[Privacy-Preserving Hybrid Ensemble Model for Network Anomaly Detection: Balancing Security and Data Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09001v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving network anomaly detection has become an essential area of research due to growing concerns over the protection of sensitive data. Traditional anomaly de- tection models often prioritize accuracy while neglecting the critical aspect of privacy. In this work, we propose a hybrid ensemble model that incorporates privacy-preserving techniques to address both detection accuracy and data protection. Our model combines the strengths of several machine learning algo- rithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to create a robust system capable of identifying network anomalies while ensuring privacy. The proposed approach in- tegrates advanced preprocessing techniques that enhance data quality and address the challenges of small sample sizes and imbalanced datasets. By embedding privacy measures into the model design, our solution offers a significant advancement over existing methods, ensuring both enhanced detection performance and strong privacy safeguards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 5th International Conference on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things Engineering(ICBAIE 2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[Hierarchical Entropy Disruption for Ransomware Detection: A Computationally-Driven Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08843v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of encryption-based threats has rendered conventional detection mechanisms increasingly ineffective against sophisticated attack strategies. Monitoring entropy variations across hierarchical system levels offers an alternative approach to identifying unauthorized data modifications without relying on static signatures. A framework leveraging hierarchical entropy disruption was introduced to analyze deviations in entropy distributions, capturing behavioral anomalies indicative of malicious encryption operations. Evaluating the framework across multiple ransomware variants demonstrated its capability to achieve high detection accuracy while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Entropy distributions across different system directories revealed that encryption activities predominantly targeted user-accessible files, aligning with observed attacker strategies. Detection latency analysis indicated that early-stage identification was feasible, mitigating potential data loss before critical system impact occurred. The framework's ability to operate efficiently in real-time environments was validated through an assessment of resource utilization, confirming a balanced trade-off between detection precision and computational efficiency. Comparative benchmarking against established detection methods highlighted the limitations of conventional approaches in identifying novel ransomware variants, whereas entropy-based anomaly detection provided resilience against obfuscation techniques.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CurvGAD: Leveraging Curvature for Enhanced Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08605v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does the intrinsic curvature of complex networks hold the key to unveiling graph anomalies that conventional approaches overlook? Reconstruction-based graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods overlook such geometric outliers, focusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies. To this end, we propose CurvGAD - a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder that introduces the notion of curvature-based geometric anomalies. CurvGAD introduces two parallel pipelines for enhanced anomaly interpretability: (1) Curvature-equivariant geometry reconstruction, which focuses exclusively on reconstructing the edge curvatures using a mixed-curvature, Riemannian encoder and Gaussian kernel-based decoder; and (2) Curvature-invariant structure and attribute reconstruction, which decouples structural and attribute anomalies from geometric irregularities by regularizing graph curvature under discrete Ollivier-Ricci flow, thereby isolating the non-geometric anomalies. By leveraging curvature, CurvGAD refines the existing anomaly classifications and identifies new curvature-driven anomalies. Extensive experimentation over 10 real-world datasets (both homophilic and heterophilic) demonstrates an improvement of up to 6.5% over state-of-the-art GAD methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GenIAS: Generator for Instantiating Anomalies in time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08262v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent and promising approach for building time series anomaly detection (TSAD) models is to inject synthetic samples of anomalies within real data sets. The existing injection mechanisms have significant limitations - most of them rely on ad hoc, hand-crafted strategies which fail to capture the natural diversity of anomalous patterns, or are restricted to univariate time series settings. To address these challenges, we design a generative model for TSAD using a variational autoencoder, which is referred to as a Generator for Instantiating Anomalies in Time Series (GenIAS). GenIAS is designed to produce diverse and realistic synthetic anomalies for TSAD tasks. By employing a novel learned perturbation mechanism in the latent space and injecting the perturbed patterns in different segments of time series, GenIAS can generate anomalies with greater diversity and varying scales. Further, guided by a new triplet loss function, which uses a min-max margin and a new variance-scaling approach to further enforce the learning of compact normal patterns, GenIAS ensures that anomalies are distinct from normal samples while remaining realistic. The approach is effective for both univariate and multivariate time series. We demonstrate the diversity and realism of the generated anomalies. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GenIAS - when integrated into a TSAD task - consistently outperforms seventeen traditional and deep anomaly detection models, thereby highlighting the potential of generative models for time series anomaly generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection on Graphs: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08105v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning has witnessed rapid growth, driving advancements across diverse domains. However, the in-distribution assumption, where training and testing data share the same distribution, often breaks in real-world scenarios, leading to degraded model performance under distribution shifts. This challenge has catalyzed interest in graph out-of-distribution (GOOD) detection, which focuses on identifying graph data that deviates from the distribution seen during training, thereby enhancing model robustness. In this paper, we provide a rigorous definition of GOOD detection and systematically categorize existing methods into four types: enhancement-based, reconstruction-based, information propagation-based, and classification-based approaches. We analyze the principles and mechanisms of each approach and clarify the distinctions between GOOD detection and related fields, such as graph anomaly detection, outlier detection, and GOOD generalization. Beyond methodology, we discuss practical applications and theoretical foundations, highlighting the unique challenges posed by graph data. Finally, we discuss the primary challenges and propose future directions to advance this emerging field.

| **[Advancing climate model interpretability: Feature attribution for Arctic melt anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07741v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus of our work is improving the interpretability of anomalies in climate models and advancing our understanding of Arctic melt dynamics. The Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets are experiencing rapid surface melting and increased freshwater runoff, contributing significantly to global sea level rise. Understanding the mechanisms driving snowmelt in these regions is crucial. ERA5, a widely used reanalysis dataset in polar climate studies, offers extensive climate variables and global data assimilation. However, its snowmelt model employs an energy imbalance approach that may oversimplify the complexity of surface melt. In contrast, the Glacier Energy and Mass Balance (GEMB) model incorporates additional physical processes, such as snow accumulation, firn densification, and meltwater percolation/refreezing, providing a more detailed representation of surface melt dynamics. In this research, we focus on analyzing surface snowmelt dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet using feature attribution for anomalous melt events in ERA5 and GEMB models. We present a novel unsupervised attribution method leveraging counterfactual explanation method to analyze detected anomalies in ERA5 and GEMB. Our anomaly detection results are validated using MEaSUREs ground-truth data, and the attributions are evaluated against established feature ranking methods, including XGBoost, Shapley values, and Random Forest. Our attribution framework identifies the physics behind each model and the climate features driving melt anomalies. These findings demonstrate the utility of our attribution method in enhancing the interpretability of anomalies in climate models and advancing our understanding of Arctic melt dynamics.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |
| **[MAAT: Mamba Adaptive Anomaly Transformer with association discrepancy for time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07858v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in time series is essential for industrial monitoring and environmental sensing, yet distinguishing anomalies from complex patterns remains challenging. Existing methods like the Anomaly Transformer and DCdetector have progressed, but they face limitations such as sensitivity to short-term contexts and inefficiency in noisy, non-stationary environments. To overcome these issues, we introduce MAAT, an improved architecture that enhances association discrepancy modeling and reconstruction quality. MAAT features Sparse Attention, efficiently capturing long-range dependencies by focusing on relevant time steps, thereby reducing computational redundancy. Additionally, a Mamba-Selective State Space Model is incorporated into the reconstruction module, utilizing a skip connection and Gated Attention to improve anomaly localization and detection performance. Extensive experiments show that MAAT significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving better anomaly distinguishability and generalization across various time series applications, setting a new standard for unsupervised time series anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection and Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07601v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study.

| **[FADE: Forecasting for Anomaly Detection on ECG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07389v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular diseases, a leading cause of noncommunicable disease-related deaths, require early and accurate detection to improve patient outcomes. Taking advantage of advances in machine learning and deep learning, multiple approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the challenge of detecting ECG anomalies. Typically, these methods are based on the manual interpretation of ECG signals, which is time consuming and depends on the expertise of healthcare professionals. The objective of this work is to propose a deep learning system, FADE, designed for normal ECG forecasting and anomaly detection, which reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets and manual interpretation. FADE has been trained in a self-supervised manner with a novel morphological inspired loss function. Unlike conventional models that learn from labeled anomalous ECG waveforms, our approach predicts the future of normal ECG signals, thus avoiding the need for extensive labeled datasets. Using a novel distance function to compare forecasted ECG signals with actual sensor data, our method effectively identifies cardiac anomalies. Additionally, this approach can be adapted to new contexts through domain adaptation techniques. To evaluate our proposal, we performed a set of experiments using two publicly available datasets: MIT-BIH NSR and MIT-BIH Arrythmia. The results demonstrate that our system achieves an average accuracy of 83.84% in anomaly detection, while correctly classifying normal ECG signals with an accuracy of 85.46%. Our proposed approach exhibited superior performance in the early detection of cardiac anomalies in ECG signals, surpassing previous methods that predominantly identify a limited range of anomalies. FADE effectively detects both abnormal heartbeats and arrhythmias, offering significant advantages in healthcare through cost reduction or processing of large-scale ECG data.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce TimeDiT, a diffusion transformer model that synergistically combines transformer-based temporal dependency learning with diffusion-based probabilistic sampling. TimeDiT employs a unified masking mechanism to harmonize the training and inference process across diverse tasks while introducing a theoretically grounded, finetuning-free model editing strategy that enables flexible integration of external knowledge during sampling. Acknowledging the challenges of unifying multiple downstream tasks under a single model, our systematic evaluation demonstrates TimeDiT's effectiveness both in fundamental tasks, i.e., forecasting and imputation, through zero-shot/fine-tuning; and in domain tasks, i.e., multi-resolution forecasting, anomaly detection, and data generation, establishing it as a \textit{proto-foundation model} that bridges the gap between general-purpose and domain-specific models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 11 Figures, 22 Tables.

Machine Learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) offer advanced detection capabilities but rely on labeled attack data, which limits their ability to identify unknown threats. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) presents a promising solution by using only normal data to detect patterns and anomalies. This paper introduces SAFE, a novel framework that transforms tabular network intrusion data into an image-like format, enabling Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) to learn robust representations of network behavior. The features extracted by the MAEs are then incorporated into a lightweight novelty detector, enhancing the effectiveness of anomaly detection. Experimental results demonstrate that SAFE outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection method, Scale Learning-based Deep Anomaly Detection method (SLAD), by up to 26.2% and surpasses the state-of-the-art SSL-based network intrusion detection approach, Anomal-E, by up to 23.5% in F1-score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> | None |

In our study, we developed a GPT-4o-based tool capable of transforming event logs into a structured format and identifying reworked activities within business event logs. The analysis was performed on a synthetic dataset designed to contain rework anomalies but free of loops. To evaluate the anomaly detection capabilities of GPT 4o-2024-08-06, we used three prompting techniques: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot. These techniques were tested on different anomaly distributions, namely normal, uniform, and exponential, to identify the most effective approach for each case. The results demonstrate the strong performance of GPT-4o-2024-08-06. On our dataset, the model achieved 96.14% accuracy with one-shot prompting for the normal distribution, 97.94% accuracy with few-shot prompting for the uniform distribution, and 74.21% accuracy with few-shot prompting for the exponential distribution. These results highlight the model's potential as a reliable tool for detecting rework anomalies in event logs and how anomaly distribution and prompting strategy influence the model's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 images, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication and presentation at the 2025 IEEE International systems Conference (SysCon)</p></details> | None |

Unlike supervised models, unsupervised scenarios lack prior information, making it difficult to effectively distinguish redundant and complementary multimodal features. To address this, we propose the Multimodal Task Representation Memory Bank (MTRMB) method through two key technical innovations: A Key-Prompt-Multimodal Knowledge (KPMK) mechanism that uses concise key prompts to guide cross-modal feature interaction between BERT and ViT. Refined Structure-based Contrastive Learning (RSCL) leveraging Grounding DINO and SAM to generate precise segmentation masks, pulling features of the same structural region closer while pushing different structural regions apart. Experiments on MVtec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate MTRMB's superiority, achieving an average detection accuracy of 0.921 at the lowest forgetting rate, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

This survey presents the first comprehensive review of recent advancements in FM-based anomaly detection. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies FMs into three categories based on their roles in anomaly detection tasks, i.e., as encoders, detectors, or interpreters. We provide a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art methods and discuss key challenges in leveraging FMs for improved anomaly detection.

| **[LogLLM: Log-based Anomaly Detection Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08561v4)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems often record important runtime information in logs to help with troubleshooting. Log-based anomaly detection has become a key research area that aims to identify system issues through log data, ultimately enhancing the reliability of software systems. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle to capture the semantic information embedded in log data, which is typically organized in natural language. In this paper, we propose LogLLM, a log-based anomaly detection framework that leverages large language models (LLMs). LogLLM employs BERT for extracting semantic vectors from log messages, while utilizing Llama, a transformer decoder-based model, for classifying log sequences. Additionally, we introduce a projector to align the vector representation spaces of BERT and Llama, ensuring a cohesive understanding of log semantics. Unlike conventional methods that require log parsers to extract templates, LogLLM preprocesses log messages with regular expressions, streamlining the entire process. Our framework is trained through a novel three-stage procedure designed to enhance performance and adaptability. Experimental results across four public datasets demonstrate that LogLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Even when handling unstable logs, it effectively captures the semantic meaning of log messages and detects anomalies accurately.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A 3D Multimodal Feature for Infrastructure Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05779v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ageing structures require periodic inspections to identify structural defects. Previous work has used geometric distortions to locate cracks in synthetic masonry bridge point clouds but has struggled to detect small cracks. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel 3D multimodal feature, 3DMulti-FPFHI, that combines a customized Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) with an intensity feature. This feature is integrated into the PatchCore anomaly detection algorithm and evaluated through statistical and parametric analyses. The method is further evaluated using point clouds of a real masonry arch bridge and a full-scale experimental model of a concrete tunnel. Results show that the 3D intensity feature enhances inspection quality by improving crack detection; it also enables the identification of water ingress which introduces intensity anomalies. The 3DMulti-FPFHI outperforms FPFH and a state-of-the-art multimodal anomaly detection method. The potential of the method to address diverse infrastructure anomaly detection scenarios is highlighted by the minimal requirements for data compared to learning-based methods.

However, they suf- fer from limitations in terms of the number of defect sam- ples, types of defects, and availability of real-world scenes. These constraints inhibit researchers from further exploring the performance of industrial detection with higher accuracy. To this end, we propose a new large-scale anomaly detection dataset called 3CAD, which is derived from real 3C produc- tion lines. Specifically, the proposed 3CAD includes eight different types of manufactured parts, totaling 27,039 high- resolution images labeled with pixel-level anomalies. The key features of 3CAD are that it covers anomalous regions of different sizes, multiple anomaly types, and the possibility of multiple anomalous regions and multiple anomaly types per anomaly image. This is the largest and first anomaly de- tection dataset dedicated to 3C product quality control for community exploration and development. Meanwhile, we in- troduce a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised anomaly detection: a Coarse-to-Fine detection paradigm with Recovery Guidance (CFRG). To detect small defect anoma- lies, the proposed CFRG utilizes a coarse-to-fine detection paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a heterogeneous distilla- tion model for coarse localization and then fine localiza- tion through a segmentation model. In addition, to better capture normal patterns, we introduce recovery features as guidance. Finally, we report the results of our CFRG frame- work and popular anomaly detection methods on the 3CAD dataset, demonstrating strong competitiveness and providing a highly challenging benchmark to promote the development of the anomaly detection field.

In this paper, we propose the Extended Histogram-Based Outlier Score (EHBOS), which enhances HBOS by incorporating two-dimensional histograms to capture dependencies between feature pairs. This extension allows EHBOS to identify contextual and dependency-driven anomalies that HBOS fails to detect. We evaluate EHBOS on 17 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse anomaly detection scenarios. EHBOS outperforms HBOS on several datasets, particularly those where feature interactions are critical in defining the anomaly structure, achieving notable improvements in ROC AUC. These results highlight that EHBOS can be a valuable extension to HBOS, with the ability to model complex feature dependencies. EHBOS offers a powerful new tool for anomaly detection, particularly in datasets where contextual or relational anomalies play a significant role.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Learning with Reservoir State Analysis for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05679v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With a growing data privacy concern, federated learning has emerged as a promising framework to train machine learning models without sharing locally distributed data. In federated learning, local model training by multiple clients and model integration by a server are repeated only through model parameter sharing. Most existing federated learning methods assume training deep learning models, which are often computationally demanding. To deal with this issue, we propose federated learning methods with reservoir state analysis to seek computational efficiency and data privacy protection simultaneously. Specifically, our method relies on Mahalanobis Distance of Reservoir States (MD-RS) method targeting time series anomaly detection, which learns a distribution of reservoir states for normal inputs and detects anomalies based on a deviation from the learned distribution. Iterative updating of statistical parameters in the MD-RS enables incremental federated learning (IncFed MD-RS). We evaluate the performance of IncFed MD-RS using benchmark datasets for time series anomaly detection. The results show that IncFed MD-RS outperforms other federated learning methods with deep learning and reservoir computing models particularly when clients' data are relatively short and heterogeneous. We demonstrate that IncFed MD-RS is robust against reduced sample data compared to other methods. We also show that the computational cost of IncFed MD-RS can be reduced by subsampling from the reservoir states without performance degradation. The proposed method is beneficial especially in anomaly detection applications where computational efficiency, algorithm simplicity, and low communication cost are required.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 16 figures, submitted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Dual Defense: Enhancing Privacy and Mitigating Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05547v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is inherently susceptible to privacy breaches and poisoning attacks. To tackle these challenges, researchers have separately devised secure aggregation mechanisms to protect data privacy and robust aggregation methods that withstand poisoning attacks. However, simultaneously addressing both concerns is challenging; secure aggregation facilitates poisoning attacks as most anomaly detection techniques require access to unencrypted local model updates, which are obscured by secure aggregation. Few recent efforts to simultaneously tackle both challenges offen depend on impractical assumption of non-colluding two-server setups that disrupt FL's topology, or three-party computation which introduces scalability issues, complicating deployment and application. To overcome this dilemma, this paper introduce a Dual Defense Federated learning (DDFed) framework. DDFed simultaneously boosts privacy protection and mitigates poisoning attacks, without introducing new participant roles or disrupting the existing FL topology. DDFed initially leverages cutting-edge fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to securely aggregate model updates, without the impractical requirement for non-colluding two-server setups and ensures strong privacy protection. Additionally, we proposes a unique two-phase anomaly detection mechanism for encrypted model updates, featuring secure similarity computation and feedback-driven collaborative selection, with additional measures to prevent potential privacy breaches from Byzantine clients incorporated into the detection process. We conducted extensive experiments on various model poisoning attacks and FL scenarios, including both cross-device and cross-silo FL. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DDFed successfully protects model privacy and effectively defends against model poisoning threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> | None |

Existing semi-supervised approaches assume that most unlabeled data are normal, and train anomaly detectors by minimizing the anomaly scores for the unlabeled data while maximizing those for the labeled anomaly data. However, in practice, the unlabeled data are often contaminated with anomalies. This weakens the effect of maximizing the anomaly scores for anomalies, and prevents us from improving the detection performance. To solve this problem, we propose the deep positive-unlabeled anomaly detection framework, which integrates positive-unlabeled learning with deep anomaly detection models such as autoencoders and deep support vector data descriptions. Our approach enables the approximation of anomaly scores for normal data using the unlabeled data and the labeled anomaly data. Therefore, without labeled normal data, our approach can train anomaly detectors by minimizing the anomaly scores for normal data while maximizing those for the labeled anomaly data. Experiments on various datasets show that our approach achieves better detection performance than existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revirew.

We propose Multi-scale Masked Autoencoder for ECG anomaly detection (MMAE-ECG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively captures both global and local dependencies in ECG data. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that rely on heartbeat segmentation or R-peak detection, MMAE-ECG eliminates the need for such pre-processing steps, enhancing its suitability for clinical deployment. MMAE-ECG partitions ECG signals into non-overlapping segments, with each segment assigned learnable positional embeddings. A novel multi-scale masking strategy and multi-scale attention mechanism, along with distinct positional embeddings, enable a lightweight Transformer encoder to effectively capture both local and global dependencies. The masked segments are then reconstructed using a single-layer Transformer block, with an aggregation strategy employed during inference to refine the outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly reducing computational complexity-approximately 1/78 of the floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for inference. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the potential of multi-scale masked autoencoders for anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in a journal</p></details> | None |

Current un-/weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks trained only on healthy data; however GAN-based networks are more challenging to train due to issues with simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, etc. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised Implicitly guided COuNterfactual diffusion model for Detecting Anomalies in PET images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases containing both local and public datasets. The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUVmax thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies.

This research explores the application of the Fisher autoencoder as an unsupervised deep learning method for detecting anomalies in aero-engine multivariate sensor data, using a Gaussian mixture as the prior distribution of the latent space. The proposed method aims to minimize the Fisher divergence between the true and the modeled data distribution in order to train an autoencoder that can capture the normal patterns of aero-engine behavior. The Fisher divergence is robust to model uncertainty, meaning it can handle noisy or incomplete data. The Fisher autoencoder also has well-defined latent space regions, which makes it more generalizable and regularized for various types of aero-engines as well as facilitates diagnostic purposes. The proposed approach improves the accuracy of anomaly detection and reduces false alarms. Simulations using the CMAPSS dataset demonstrate the model's efficacy in achieving timely anomaly detection, even in the case of an unbalanced dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication and presentation at the 63rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> | None |

We first introduce a method for detecting driver reactions through speed and sound anomaly detection, leveraging unsupervised learning techniques. For hazard detection, we employ a set of heuristic rules as weak classifiers, which are combined using an ensemble method. This ensemble approach is further refined with differential privacy to mitigate overconfidence, ensuring robustness despite the lack of labeled data. Lastly, we use state-of-the-art vision-language models for hazard captioning, generating descriptive labels for the detected hazards. Our method achieved the highest scores in the Challenge on Out-of-Label in Autonomous Driving, demonstrating its effectiveness across all three tasks.

Machine learning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are typically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which raises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining popularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data. However, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions. While adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain largely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain. Moreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly unknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in energy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in an FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data. The results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks, attributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10% even with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks than centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12th ...</summary><p>12th IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability</p></details> | None |

In this paper we analyse unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) from the perspective of the manifold created in DR. We present an idealised illustration, "Finding Pegasus", and a novel formal framework with which we categorise AD methods and their results into "on manifold" and "off manifold". We define these terms and show how they differ. We then use this insight to develop an approach of combining AD methods which significantly boosts AD recall without sacrificing precision in situations employing high DR. When tested on MNIST data, our approach of combining AD methods improves recall by as much as 16 percent compared with simply combining with the best standalone AD method (Isolation Forest), a result which shows great promise for its application to real-world data.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures | None |

Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion (HED) introduces a structured entropy-based anomaly classification mechanism that systematically tracks fluctuations in entropy evolution to differentiate between benign cryptographic processes and unauthorized encryption attempts. The integration of hierarchical clustering, entropy profiling, and probabilistic diffusion modeling refines detection granularity, ensuring that encryption anomalies are identified despite obfuscation strategies or incremental execution methodologies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that HED maintained high classification accuracy across diverse ransomware families, outperforming traditional heuristic-based and signature-driven approaches while reducing false positive occurrences. Comparative analysis highlighted that entropy-driven anomaly segmentation improved detection efficiency under variable system workload conditions, ensuring real-time classification feasibility. The computational overhead associated with entropy anomaly detection remained within operational constraints, reinforcing the suitability of entropy-driven classification for large-scale deployment. The ability to identify adversarial entropy manipulations before encryption completion contributes to broader cybersecurity defenses, offering a structured methodology for isolating unauthorized cryptographic activities within heterogeneous computing environments. The results further emphasized that entropy evolution modeling facilitates predictive anomaly detection, enhancing resilience against encryption evasion techniques designed to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms.</p></details> |  | None |

Untrained anomaly detection based on only one sample is an emerging research problem motivated by real manufacturing industries such as personalized manufacturing that only one sample can be collected without any additional labels. How to accurately identify anomalies based on one 3D point cloud sample is a critical challenge in both industrial applications and the field of machine learning. This paper aims to provide a formal definition of untrained anomaly detection problem based on 3D point cloud data, discuss the differences between untrained anomaly detection and current unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Unlike unsupervised learning, untrained methods do not rely on any data, including unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage prior knowledge about the manufacturing surfaces and anomalies. Examples are used to illustrate these prior knowledge and untrained machine learning model. Afterwards, literature review on untrained anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is also provided, and the potential of untrained deep neural networks for anomaly detection is also discussed as outlooks.</p></details> | 6 pages,0 figure | None |

This paper investigates this problem from the first principle and it makes four folds of contributions. First, a new empirical finding is revealed: time series with different time granularities (or corresponding frequency resolutions) exhibit distinct joint distributions in the frequency domain. This implies a crucial aspect of learning universal knowledge, one that has been overlooked by previous studies. Second, a novel Fourier knowledge attention mechanism is proposed to enable learning time granularity-aware representations from both the temporal and frequency domains. Third, an autoregressive blank infilling pre-training framework is incorporated to time series analysis for the first time, leading to a generative tasks agnostic pre-training strategy. To this end, we develop the General Time-series Model (GTM), a unified MTS foundation model that addresses the limitation of contemporary time series models, which often require token, pre-training, or model-level customizations for downstream tasks adaption. Fourth, extensive experiments show that GTM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all generative tasks, including long-term forecasting, anomaly detection, and imputation.</p></details> |  | None |

Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

Existing NAD methods primarily embed graphs within a single Euclidean space, while overlooking the potential of non-Euclidean spaces. Besides, to address the prevalent issue of limited supervision in real NAD tasks, previous methods tend to leverage synthetic data to collect auxiliary information, which is not an effective solution as shown in our experiments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel SpaceGNN model designed for NAD tasks with extremely limited labels. Specifically, we provide deeper insights into a task-relevant framework by empirically analyzing the benefits of different spaces for node representations, based on which, we design a Learnable Space Projection function that effectively encodes nodes into suitable spaces. Besides, we introduce the concept of weighted homogeneity, which we empirically and theoretically validate as an effective coefficient during information propagation. This concept inspires the design of the Distance Aware Propagation module. Furthermore, we propose the Multiple Space Ensemble module, which extracts comprehensive information for NAD under conditions of extremely limited supervision. Our findings indicate that this module is more beneficial than data augmentation techniques for NAD. Extensive experiments conducted on 9 real datasets confirm the superiority of SpaceGNN, which outperforms the best rival by an average of 8.55% in AUC and 4.31% in F1 scores.

This paper extends recent advancements in statistically significant CP detection, based on Selective Inference (SI), to the frequency domain. The proposed SI method quantifies the statistical significance of detected CPs in the frequency domain using $p$-values, ensuring that the detected changes reflect genuine structural shifts in the target system. We address two major technical challenges to achieve this. First, we extend the existing SI framework to the frequency domain by appropriately utilizing the properties of discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Second, we develop an SI method that provides valid $p$-values for CPs where changes occur across multiple frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reliably identifies genuine CPs with strong statistical guarantees, enabling more accurate root-cause analysis in the frequency domain of complex systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has been actively explored to tackle time series representation. However, a key challenge is that the data augmentation process in CL can distort seasonal patterns or temporal dependencies, inevitably leading to a loss of semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose Topological Contrastive Learning for time series (TopoCL). TopoCL mitigates such information loss by incorporating persistent homology, which captures the topological characteristics of data that remain invariant under transformations. In this paper, we treat the temporal and topological properties of time series data as distinct modalities. Specifically, we compute persistent homology to construct topological features of time series data, representing them in persistence diagrams. We then design a neural network to encode these persistent diagrams. Our approach jointly optimizes CL within the time modality and time-topology correspondence, promoting a comprehensive understanding of both temporal semantics and topological properties of time series. We conduct extensive experiments on four downstream tasks-classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and transfer learning. The results demonstrate that TopoCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TNNLS (under review)</p></details> | None |

The arrival of photons as a function of time follows a Poisson process and can vary by orders-of-magnitude, presenting obstacles for common tasks such as source classification, physical property derivation, and anomaly detection. Previous work has either failed to directly capture the Poisson nature of the data or only focuses on Poisson rate function reconstruction. In this work, we present Poisson Process AutoDecoder (PPAD). PPAD is a neural field decoder that maps fixed-length latent features to continuous Poisson rate functions across energy band and time via unsupervised learning. PPAD reconstructs the rate function and yields a representation at the same time. We demonstrate the efficacy of PPAD via reconstruction, regression, classification and anomaly detection experiments using the Chandra Source Catalog.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures | None |

Given their persistence, significant effort is required to detect them and respond effectively. Existing provenance-based attack detection methods often lack interpretability and suffer from high false positive rates, while investigation approaches are either supervised or limited to known attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SHIELD, a novel approach that combines statistical anomaly detection and graph-based analysis with the contextual analysis capabilities of large language models (LLMs). SHIELD leverages the implicit knowledge of LLMs to uncover hidden attack patterns in provenance data, while reducing false positives and providing clear, interpretable attack descriptions. This reduces analysts' alert fatigue and makes it easier for them to understand the threat landscape. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates SHIELD's effectiveness and computational efficiency in real-world scenarios. SHIELD was shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher precision and recall. SHIELD's integration of anomaly detection, LLM-driven contextual analysis, and advanced graph-based correlation establishes a new benchmark for APT detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Compact and Robust Representations for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05130v4)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distance-based anomaly detection methods rely on compact and separable in-distribution (ID) embeddings to effectively delineate anomaly boundaries. Single-positive contrastive formulations suffer from class collision, promoting unnecessary intra-class variance within ID samples. While multi-positive formulations can improve inlier compactness, they fail to preserve the diversity among synthetic outliers. We address these limitations by proposing a contrastive pretext task for anomaly detection that enforces three key properties: (1) compact ID clustering to reduce intra-class variance, (2) inlier-outlier separation to enhance inter-class separation, and (3) outlier-outlier separation to maintain diversity among synthetic outliers and prevent representation collapse. These properties work together to ensure a more robust and discriminative feature space for anomaly detection. Our approach achieves approximately 12x faster convergence than NT-Xent and 7x faster than Rot-SupCon, with superior performance. On CIFAR-10, it delivers an average performance boost of 6.2% over NT-Xent and 2% over Rot-SupCon, with class-specific improvements of up to 16.9%.

This allows us to extend the scope of asynchronous time series analysis beyond forecasting to include tasks like anomaly detection and data imputation. We further introduce Stochastic Soft Prompting, a novel prompt-tuning mechanism that significantly improves model performance, outperforming existing fine-tuning methods such as QLoRA.

Autoencoders (AEs) or generative models are often employed to model the data distribution of normal inputs and subsequently identify anomalous, out-of-distribution inputs by high reconstruction error or low likelihood, respectively. However, AEs may generalize and achieve small reconstruction errors on abnormal inputs. We propose a decoupled training approach for anomaly detection that both an AE and a likelihood model trained with noise contrastive estimation (NCE). After training the AE, NCE estimates a probability density function, to serve as the anomaly score, on the joint space of the AE's latent representation combined with features of the reconstruction quality. To further reduce the false negative rate in NCE we systematically varying the reconstruction features to augment the training and optimize the contrastive Gaussian noise distribution. Experimental assessments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach matches the performance of prevalent state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rule-Based Error Detection and Correction to Operationalize Movement Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14250v4)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of movement trajectories has many applications in transportation and is a key component for large-scale movement trajectory generation and anomaly detection which has key safety applications in the aftermath of a disaster or other external shock. However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised anomaly detection in large-scale estuarine acoustic telemetry data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01543v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acoustic telemetry data plays a vital role in understanding the behaviour and movement of aquatic animals. However, these datasets, which often consist of millions of individual data points, frequently contain anomalous movements that pose significant challenges. Traditionally, anomalous movements are identified either manually or through basic statistical methods, approaches that are time-consuming and prone to high rates of unidentified anomalies in large datasets. This study focuses on the development of automated classifiers for a large telemetry dataset comprising detections from fifty acoustically tagged dusky kob monitored in the Breede Estuary, South Africa. Using an array of 16 acoustic receivers deployed throughout the estuary between 2016 and 2021, we collected over three million individual data points. We present detailed guidelines for data pre-processing, resampling strategies, labelling process, feature engineering, data splitting methodologies, and the selection and interpretation of machine learning and deep learning models for anomaly detection. Among the evaluated models, neural networks autoencoder (NN-AE) demonstrated superior performance, aided by our proposed threshold-finding algorithm. NN-AE achieved a high recall with no false normal (i.e., no misclassifications of anomalous movements as normal patterns), a critical factor in ensuring that no true anomalies are overlooked. In contrast, other models exhibited false normal fractions exceeding 0.9, indicating they failed to detect the majority of true anomalies; a significant limitation for telemetry studies where undetected anomalies can distort interpretations of movement patterns. While the NN-AE's performance highlights its reliability and robustness in detecting anomalies, it faced challenges in accurately learning normal movement patterns when these patterns gradually deviated from anomalous ones.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dense Subgraph Discovery Meets Strong Triadic Closure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01435v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding dense subgraphs is a core problem with numerous graph mining applications such as community detection in social networks and anomaly detection. However, in many real-world networks connections are not equal. One way to label edges as either strong or weak is to use strong triadic closure~(STC). Here, if one node connects strongly with two other nodes, then those two nodes should be connected at least with a weak edge. STC-labelings are not unique and finding the maximum number of strong edges is NP-hard. In this paper, we apply STC to dense subgraph discovery. More formally, our score for a given subgraph is the ratio between the sum of the number of strong edges and weak edges, weighted by a user parameter $\lambda$, and the number of nodes of the subgraph. Our goal is to find a subgraph and an STC-labeling maximizing the score. We show that for $\lambda = 1$, our problem is equivalent to finding the densest subgraph, while for $\lambda = 0$, our problem is equivalent to finding the largest clique, making our problem NP-hard. We propose an exact algorithm based on integer linear programming and four practical polynomial-time heuristics. We present an extensive experimental study that shows that our algorithms can find the ground truth in synthetic datasets and run efficiently in real-world datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In critical systems like manufacturing, malfunctioning outlier detection can be costly and safety-critical. Therefore, there is a significant need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) when deploying opaque models in such environments. This study focuses on manufacturing time series data from a German automotive supply industry. We utilize autoencoders to compress the entire time series and then apply anomaly detection techniques to its latent features. For outlier interpretation, we (i) adopt widely used XAI techniques to the autoencoder's encoder. Additionally, (ii) we propose AEE, Aggregated Explanatory Ensemble, a novel approach that fuses explanations of multiple XAI techniques into a single, more expressive interpretation.

| **[One-to-Normal: Anomaly Personalization for Few-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01201v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Anomaly Detection (AD) methods have predominantly relied on unsupervised learning from extensive normal data. Recent AD methods have evolved with the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing few-shot anomaly detection capabilities. However, these latest AD methods still exhibit limitations in accuracy improvement. One contributing factor is their direct comparison of a query image's features with those of few-shot normal images. This direct comparison often leads to a loss of precision and complicates the extension of these techniques to more complex domains--an area that remains underexplored in a more refined and comprehensive manner. To address these limitations, we introduce the anomaly personalization method, which performs a personalized one-to-normal transformation of query images using an anomaly-free customized generation model, ensuring close alignment with the normal manifold. Moreover, to further enhance the stability and robustness of prediction results, we propose a triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy, which incorporates a comprehensive comparison between the query and generated anomaly-free data pool and prompt information. Extensive evaluations across eleven datasets in three domains demonstrate our model's effectiveness compared to the latest AD methods. Additionally, our method has been proven to transfer flexibly to other AD methods, with the generated image data effectively improving the performance of other AD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Th...</summary><p>In The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS2024)</p></details> | None |

This motivates us to develop the online generalized method of moments (OGMM), an explicitly updated estimation and inference framework in the time series setting. The OGMM inherits many properties of offline GMM, such as its broad applicability to many problems in econometrics and statistics, natural accommodation for over-identification, and achievement of semiparametric efficiency under temporal dependence. As an online method, the key gain relative to offline GMM is the vast improvement in time complexity and memory requirement. Building on the OGMM framework, we propose improved versions of online Sargan--Hansen and structural stability tests following recent work in econometrics and statistics. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we observe encouraging finite-sample performance in online instrumental variables regression, online over-identifying restrictions test, online quantile regression, and online anomaly detection. Interesting applications of OGMM to stochastic volatility modelling and inertial sensor calibration are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of OGMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages (26 main), 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality</p></details> | None |

Traditional WUM methods often rely on web server logs, which limit data diversity and quality. Integrating application logs with web analytics, the CAWAL framework creates comprehensive session and page view datasets, providing a more detailed view of user interactions and effectively addressing these limitations. This integration enhances data diversity and quality while eliminating the preprocessing stage required in conventional WUM, leading to greater process efficiency. The enriched datasets, created by cross-integrating session and page view data, were applied to advanced machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting and Random Forest, which are known for their effectiveness in capturing complex patterns and modeling non-linear relationships. These models achieved over 92% accuracy in predicting user behavior and significantly improved anomaly detection capabilities. The results show that this approach offers detailed insights into user behavior and system performance metrics, making it a reliable solution for improving large-scale web portals' efficiency, reliability, and scalability.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures | None |

This paper introduces KoopAGRU, a new deep learning model designed to tackle this problem by combining Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Deep Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DeepDMD), and Koopman theory. FFT allows KoopAGRU to decompose temporal data into time-variant and time-invariant components providing precise modeling of complex patterns. To better control these two components, KoopAGRU utilizes Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) encoders to learn Koopman observables, enhancing the detection capability across multiple temporal scales. KoopAGRU is trained in a single process and offers fast inference times. Extensive tests on various benchmark datasets show that KoopAGRU outperforms other leading methods, achieving a new average F1-score of 90.88\% on the well-known anomalies detection task of times series datasets, and proves to be efficient and reliable in detecting anomalies in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Currently, most smart home security solutions, such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction models, are trained using fixed datasets that are precollected. However, the process of dataset collection is time-consuming and lacks the flexibility needed to adapt to the constantly evolving smart home environment. Additionally, the collection of personal data raises significant privacy concerns for users. Lately, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks across diverse application domains, thanks to their strong capabilities in natural language processing, reasoning, and problem-solving. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based synthetic dataset generation IoTGen framework to enhance the generalization of downstream smart home intelligent models. By generating new synthetic datasets that reflect changes in the environment, smart home intelligent models can be retrained to overcome the limitations of fixed and outdated data, allowing them to better align with the dynamic nature of real-world home environments. Specifically, we first propose a Structure Pattern Perception Compression (SPPC) method tailored for IoT behavior data, which preserves the most informative content in the data while significantly reducing token consumption. Then, we propose a systematic approach to create prompts and implement data generation to automatically generate IoT synthetic data with normative and reasonable properties, assisting task models in adaptive training to improve generalization and real-world performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they remain vulnerable due to the absence of robust security mechanisms in the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. In order to mitigate the security issue, many machine learning models and strategies have been proposed, which primarily focus on a subset of dominant patterns of anomalies and lack rigorous evaluation in terms of reliability and robustness. Therefore, to address the limitations of previous works and mitigate the security vulnerability in CAN bus, the current study develops a model based on the intrinsic nature of the problem to cover all dominant patterns of anomalies. To achieve this, a cascade feature-level fusion strategy optimized by a two-parameter genetic algorithm is proposed to combine temporal and spatial information. Subsequently, the model is evaluated using a paired t-test to ensure reliability and robustness. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis conducted on two widely used datasets advocates that the proposed model outperforms other models and achieves superior accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating the best performance among all models presented to date.</p></details> |  | None |

Measurement of the deep feature PDF is a valuable problem for several reasons. Notably, a. Understanding the deep feature PDF yields new insight into deep representations. b. Feature density methods are important for tasks such as anomaly detection which can improve the robustness of deep learning models in the wild. Interpretable measurement of the deep feature PDF is challenging due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD), and the Spatial intuition Limitation. Our novel measurement technique combines copula analysis with the Method of Orthogonal Moments (MOM), in order to directly measure the Generalized Characteristic Function (GCF) of the multivariate deep feature PDF. We find that, surprisingly, the one-dimensional marginals of non-negative deep CNN features after major blocks are not well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, and that these features increasingly approximate an exponential distribution with increasing network depth. Furthermore, we observe that deep features become increasingly independent with increasing network depth within their typical ranges. However, we surprisingly also observe that many deep features exhibit strong dependence (either correlation or anti-correlation) with other extremely strong detections, even if these features are independent within typical ranges. We elaborate on these findings in our discussion, where we propose a new hypothesis that exponentially infrequent large valued features correspond to strong computer vision detections of semantic targets, which would imply that these large-valued features are not outliers but rather an important detection signal.</p></details> |  | None |

The existing methods are mainly based on reconstruction error or association divergence, which are both confined to isolated subsequences with limited horizons, hardly promising unified series-level criterion. In this paper, we propose the Global Dictionary-enhanced Transformer (GDformer) with a renovated dictionary-based cross attention mechanism to cultivate the global representations shared by all normal points in the entire series. Accordingly, the cross-attention maps reflect the correlation weights between the point and global representations, which naturally leads to the representation-wise similarity-based detection criterion.

However, recent research by Hariri, Kind, and Brunner, published in TKDE 2021, has revealed issues with iForest. They identified the presence of axis-aligned ghost clusters that can be misidentified as normal clusters, leading to biased anomaly scores and inaccurate predictions. In response, they developed the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), which effectively solves these issues by eliminating the ghost clusters introduced by iForest. This enhancement results in improved consistency of anomaly scores and superior performance. We reveal a previously overlooked problem in the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), showing that it is vulnerable to ghost inter-clusters between normal clusters of data points. In this paper, we introduce the Rotated Isolation Forest (RIF) algorithm which effectively addresses both the axis-aligned ghost clusters observed in iForest and the ghost inter-clusters seen in EIF. RIF accomplishes this by randomly rotating the dataset (using random rotation matrices and QR decomposition) before feeding it into the iForest construction, thereby increasing dataset variation and eliminating ghost clusters. Our experiments conclusively demonstrate that the RIF algorithm outperforms iForest and EIF, as evidenced by the results obtained from both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Enhancing Web Service Anomaly Detection via Fine-grained Multi-modal Association and Frequency Domain Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16875v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of web service systems. Logs and metrics contain multiple information that can reflect the system's operational state and potential anomalies. Thus, existing anomaly detection methods use logs and metrics to detect web service systems' anomalies through data fusion approaches. They associate logs and metrics using coarse-grained time window alignment and capture the normal patterns of system operation through reconstruction. However, these methods have two issues that limit their performance in anomaly detection. First, due to asynchrony between logs and metrics, coarse-grained time window alignment cannot achieve a precise association between the two modalities. Second, reconstruction-based methods suffer from severe overgeneralization problems, resulting in anomalies being accurately reconstructed. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection method named FFAD to address these two issues. On the one hand, FFAD employs graph-based alignment to mine and extract associations between the modalities from the constructed log-metric relation graph, achieving precise associations between logs and metrics. On the other hand, we improve the model's fit to normal data distributions through Fourier Frequency Focus, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of anomaly detection. We validated the effectiveness of our model on two real-world industrial datasets and one open-source dataset. The results show that our method achieves an average anomaly detection F1-score of 93.6%, representing an 8.8% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW' 25 | None |

While federated learning (FL) provides a foundation for distributed model training, existing approaches often lack mechanisms to address these CPS-specific challenges. This paper introduces an enhanced FL framework with three key innovations: adaptive model aggregation based on sensor reliability, dynamic node selection for resource optimization, and Weibull-based checkpointing for fault tolerance. The proposed framework ensures reliable condition monitoring while tackling the computational and reliability challenges of industrial CPS deployments. Experiments on the NASA Bearing and Hydraulic System datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods, achieving 99.5% AUC-ROC in anomaly detection and maintaining accuracy even under node failures. Statistical validation using the Mann-Whitney U test confirms significant improvements, with a p-value less than 0.05, in both detection accuracy and computational efficiency across various operational scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Large Models in Dialogue for Active Perception and Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16300v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous aerial monitoring is an important task aimed at gathering information from areas that may not be easily accessible by humans. At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference of Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[Can Multimodal Large Language Models be Guided to Improve Industrial Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15795v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In industrial settings, the accurate detection of anomalies is essential for maintaining product quality and ensuring operational safety. Traditional industrial anomaly detection (IAD) models often struggle with flexibility and adaptability, especially in dynamic production environments where new defect types and operational changes frequently arise. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for overcoming these limitations by combining visual and textual information processing capabilities. MLLMs excel in general visual understanding due to their training on large, diverse datasets, but they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as industry-specific defect tolerance levels, which limits their effectiveness in IAD tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Echo, a novel multi-expert framework designed to enhance MLLM performance for IAD. Echo integrates four expert modules: Reference Extractor which provides a contextual baseline by retrieving similar normal images, Knowledge Guide which supplies domain-specific insights, Reasoning Expert which enables structured, stepwise reasoning for complex queries, and Decision Maker which synthesizes information from all modules to deliver precise, context-aware responses. Evaluated on the MMAD benchmark, Echo demonstrates significant improvements in adaptability, precision, and robustness, moving closer to meeting the demands of real-world industrial anomaly detection.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, existing methods for detecting community structures in mobility networks often overlook potential overlaps between communities. In this study, we conceptualize shared micro-mobility in urban spaces as a process of information exchange, where locations are connected through e-scooters, facilitating the interaction and propagation of community affiliations. As a result, similar locations are assigned the same label. Based on this concept, we developed a Geospatial Interaction Propagation model (GIP) by designing a Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA) that accounts for geographic distance decay, incorporating anomaly detection to ensure the derived community structures reflect meaningful spatial patterns. We applied this model to detect overlapping communities within the e-scooter system in Washington, D.C. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing model of overlapping community detection in both efficiency and modularity.

Surprisingly, this simple representation is sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in ShanghaiTech, the most commonly used VAD dataset.

| **[Mitigating Spurious Negative Pairs for Robust Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15434v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in Anomaly Detection (AD), the robustness of existing detection methods against adversarial attacks remains a challenge, compromising their reliability in critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving. This issue primarily arises from the AD setup, which assumes that training data is limited to a group of unlabeled normal samples, making the detectors vulnerable to adversarial anomaly samples during testing. Additionally, implementing adversarial training as a safeguard encounters difficulties, such as formulating an effective objective function without access to labels. An ideal objective function for adversarial training in AD should promote strong perturbations both within and between the normal and anomaly groups to maximize margin between normal and anomaly distribution. To address these issues, we first propose crafting a pseudo-anomaly group derived from normal group samples. Then, we demonstrate that adversarial training with contrastive loss could serve as an ideal objective function, as it creates both inter- and intra-group perturbations. However, we notice that spurious negative pairs compromise the conventional contrastive loss to achieve robust AD. Spurious negative pairs are those that should be closely mapped but are erroneously separated. These pairs introduce noise and misguide the direction of inter-group adversarial perturbations. To overcome the effect of spurious negative pairs, we define opposite pairs and adversarially pull them apart to strengthen inter-group perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance in both clean and adversarial scenarios, with a 26.1% improvement in robust detection across various challenging benchmark datasets.

| **[A Transfer Learning Framework for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Traffic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15365v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, rapid technological advancements and expanded Internet access have led to a significant rise in anomalies within network traffic and time-series data. Prompt detection of these irregularities is crucial for ensuring service quality, preventing financial losses, and maintaining robust security standards. While machine learning algorithms have shown promise in achieving high accuracy for anomaly detection, their performance is often constrained by the specific conditions of their training data. A persistent challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled data for anomaly detection in time-series datasets. This limitation hampers the training efficacy of both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning models. To address this, unsupervised transfer learning emerges as a viable solution, leveraging unlabeled data from a source domain to identify anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, many existing approaches still depend on a small amount of labeled data from the target domain. To overcome these constraints, we propose a transfer learning-based model for anomaly detection in multivariate time-series datasets. Unlike conventional methods, our approach does not require labeled data in either the source or target domains. Empirical evaluations on novel intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing techniques in accurately identifying anomalies within an entirely unlabeled target domain.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Cross-System Software Log-based Anomaly Detection Using Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15445v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems produce vast amounts of logs, serving as an essential resource for anomaly detection. Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) tools have been developed to automate the process of log-based anomaly detection for software systems. Three practical challenges are widely recognized in this field: high data labeling costs, evolving logs in dynamic systems, and adaptability across different systems. In this paper, we propose CroSysLog, an AIOps tool for log-event level anomaly detection, specifically designed in response to these challenges. Following prior approaches, CroSysLog uses a neural representation approach to gain a nuanced understanding of logs and generate representations for individual log events accordingly. CroSysLog can be trained on source systems with sufficient labeled logs from open datasets to achieve robustness, and then efficiently adapt to target systems with a few labeled log events for effective anomaly detection. We evaluate CroSysLog using open datasets of four large-scale distributed supercomputing systems: BGL, Thunderbird, Liberty, and Spirit. We used random log splits, maintaining the chronological order of consecutive log events, from these systems to train and evaluate CroSysLog. These splits were widely distributed across a one/two-year span of each system's log collection duration, thereby capturing the evolving nature of the logs in each system. Our results show that, after training CroSysLog on Liberty and BGL as source systems, CroSysLog can efficiently adapt to target systems Thunderbird and Spirit using a few labeled log events from each target system, effectively performing anomaly detection for these target systems. The results demonstrate that CroSysLog is a practical, scalable, and adaptable tool for log-event level anomaly detection in operational and maintenance contexts of software systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and networking technology, we develop a physics-based AI foundation model with high-resolution synchro-waveform measurement technology to enhance grid resilience and reduce economic losses from outages. Methods and Results:The proposed framework adopts the AI Foundation Model paradigm, where a generative and pre-trained (GPT) foundation model extracts physical features from power system measurements, enabling adaptation to a wide range of grid operation tasks. Replacing the large language models used in popular AI foundation models, this approach is based on the Wiener-Kallianpur-Rosenblatt innovation model for power system time series, trained to capture the physical laws of power flows and sinusoidal characteristics of grid measurements. The pre-trained foundation model causally extracts sufficient statistics from grid measurement time series for various downstream applications, including anomaly detection, over-current protection, probabilistic forecasting, and data compression for streaming synchro-waveform data. Numerical simulations using field-collected data demonstrate significantly improved fault detection accuracy and detection speed. Conclusion:The future grid will be rich in inverter-based resources, making it highly dynamic, stochastic, and low inertia. This work underscores the limitations of existing Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition and Phasor-Measurement-Unit monitoring systems and advocates for AI-enabled monitoring and control with high-resolution synchro-waveform technology to provide accurate situational awareness, rapid response to faults, and robust network protection.</p></details> |  | None |

The GH distribution, known for its flexibility in modeling skewness, heavy tails, and kurtosis, helps to capture complex patterns in data that deviate from Gaussian assumptions. We propose a GH-based kernel function and utilize it within Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) to develop anomaly detection frameworks. Theoretical results confirmed the positive semi-definiteness and consistency of the GH-based kernel, ensuring its suitability for machine learning applications.

| **["Stones from Other Hills can Polish Jade": Zero-shot Anomaly Image Synthesis via Cross-domain Anomaly Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15211v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial image anomaly detection (IAD) is a pivotal topic with huge value. Due to anomaly's nature, real anomalies in a specific modern industrial domain (i.e. domain-specific anomalies) are usually too rare to collect, which severely hinders IAD. Thus, zero-shot anomaly synthesis (ZSAS), which synthesizes pseudo anomaly images without any domain-specific anomaly, emerges as a vital technique for IAD. However, existing solutions are either unable to synthesize authentic pseudo anomalies, or require cumbersome training. Thus, we focus on ZSAS and propose a brand-new paradigm that can realize both authentic and training-free ZSAS. It is based on a chronically-ignored fact: Although domain-specific anomalies are rare, real anomalies from other domains (i.e. cross-domain anomalies) are actually abundant and directly applicable to ZSAS. Specifically, our new ZSAS paradigm makes three-fold contributions: First, we propose a novel method named Cross-domain Anomaly Injection (CAI), which directly exploits cross-domain anomalies to enable highly authentic ZSAS in a training-free manner. Second, to supply CAI with sufficient cross-domain anomalies, we build the first domain-agnostic anomaly dataset within our best knowledge, which provides ZSAS with abundant real anomaly patterns. Third, we propose a CAI-guided Diffusion Mechanism, which further breaks the quantity limit of real anomalies and enable unlimited anomaly synthesis. Our head-to-head comparison with existing ZSAS solutions justifies our paradigm's superior performance for IAD and demonstrates it as an effective and pragmatic ZSAS solution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[GAD-NR: Graph Anomaly Detection via Neighborhood Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01951v8)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is a technique used to identify abnormal nodes within graphs, finding applications in network security, fraud detection, social media spam detection, and various other domains. A common method for GAD is Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs), which encode graph data into node representations and identify anomalies by assessing the reconstruction quality of the graphs based on these representations. However, existing GAE models are primarily optimized for direct link reconstruction, resulting in nodes connected in the graph being clustered in the latent space. As a result, they excel at detecting cluster-type structural anomalies but struggle with more complex structural anomalies that do not conform to clusters. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution called GAD-NR, a new variant of GAE that incorporates neighborhood reconstruction for graph anomaly detection. GAD-NR aims to reconstruct the entire neighborhood of a node, encompassing the local structure, self-attributes, and neighbor attributes, based on the corresponding node representation. By comparing the neighborhood reconstruction loss between anomalous nodes and normal nodes, GAD-NR can effectively detect any anomalies. Extensive experimentation conducted on six real-world datasets validates the effectiveness of GAD-NR, showcasing significant improvements (by up to 30% in AUC) over state-of-the-art competitors. The source code for GAD-NR is openly available. Importantly, the comparative analysis reveals that the existing methods perform well only in detecting one or two types of anomalies out of the three types studied. In contrast, GAD-NR excels at detecting all three types of anomalies across the datasets, demonstrating its comprehensive anomaly detection capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM-2024)</p></details> | None |

Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field.

| **[Median of Forests for Robust Density Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15157v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust density estimation refers to the consistent estimation of the density function even when the data is contaminated by outliers. We find that existing forest density estimation at a certain point is inherently resistant to the outliers outside the cells containing the point, which we call \textit{non-local outliers}, but not resistant to the rest \textit{local outliers}. To achieve robustness against all outliers, we propose an ensemble learning algorithm called \textit{medians of forests for robust density estimation} (\textit{MFRDE}), which adopts a pointwise median operation on forest density estimators fitted on subsampled datasets. Compared to existing robust kernel-based methods, MFRDE enables us to choose larger subsampling sizes, sacrificing less accuracy for density estimation while achieving robustness. On the theoretical side, we introduce the local outlier exponent to quantify the number of local outliers. Under this exponent, we show that even if the number of outliers reaches a certain polynomial order in the sample size, MFRDE is able to achieve almost the same convergence rate as the same algorithm on uncontaminated data, whereas robust kernel-based methods fail. On the practical side, real data experiments show that MFRDE outperforms existing robust kernel-based methods. Moreover, we apply MFRDE to anomaly detection to showcase a further application.</p></details> |  | None |

Offloading ML to programmable data plane (PDP) enables quick analysis and responses to network traffic dynamics, and efficient management of network links. However, PDP hardware pipeline has significant resource limitations. For instance, Intel Tofino ASIC has only 10Mb SRAM in each stage, and lacks support for multiplication, division and floating-point operations. These constraints significantly hinder the development of IDP. This paper presents \quark, a framework that fully offloads convolutional neural network (CNN) inference onto PDP. \quark employs model pruning to simplify the CNN model, and uses quantization to support floating-point operations. Additionally, \quark divides the CNN into smaller units to improve resource utilization on the PDP. We have implemented a testbed prototype of \quark on both P4 hardware switch (Intel Tofino ASIC) and software switch (i.e., BMv2). Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that \quark achieves 97.3\% accuracy in anomaly detection task while using only 22.7\% of the SRAM resources on the Intel Tofino ASIC switch, completing inference tasks at line rate with an average latency of 42.66$\mu s$.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), 2025</p></details> | None |

However, the efficiency of FL relies on effective client selection and robust privacy preservation mechanisms. Ineffective client selection can result in suboptimal model performance, while inadequate privacy measures risk exposing sensitive data. This paper introduces a client selection framework for FL that incorporates differential privacy and fault tolerance. The proposed adaptive approach dynamically adjusts the number of selected clients based on model performance and system constraints, ensuring privacy through the addition of calibrated noise. The method is evaluated on a network anomaly detection use case using the UNSW-NB15 and ROAD datasets. Results demonstrate up to a 7% improvement in accuracy and a 25% reduction in training time compared to the FedL2P approach. Additionally, the study highlights trade-offs between privacy budgets and model performance, with higher privacy budgets leading to reduced noise and improved accuracy. While the fault tolerance mechanism introduces a slight performance decrease, it enhances robustness against client failures. Statistical validation using the Mann-Whitney U test confirms the significance of these improvements, with results achieving a p-value of less than 0.05.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Extremely Limited Labels in Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15035v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has recently received increasing attention, which aims to distinguish anomalous patterns from graphs under the guidance of a moderate amount of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled data. Although these proposed semi-supervised GAD methods have achieved great success, their superior performance will be seriously degraded when the provided labels are extremely limited due to some unpredictable factors. Besides, the existing methods primarily focus on anomaly detection in static graphs, and little effort was paid to consider the continuous evolution characteristic of graphs over time (dynamic graphs). To address these challenges, we propose a novel GAD framework (EL$^{2}$-DGAD) to tackle anomaly detection problem in dynamic graphs with extremely limited labels. Specifically, a transformer-based graph encoder model is designed to more effectively preserve evolving graph structures beyond the local neighborhood. Then, we incorporate an ego-context hypersphere classification loss to classify temporal interactions according to their structure and temporal neighborhoods while ensuring the normal samples are mapped compactly against anomalous data. Finally, the above loss is further augmented with an ego-context contrasting module which utilizes unlabeled data to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three label rates demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the existing GAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 30th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Harnessing Contrastive Learning and Neural Transformation for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07898v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays a vital role in many industrial applications. While contrastive learning has gained momentum in the time series domain for its prowess in extracting meaningful representations from unlabeled data, its straightforward application to anomaly detection is not without hurdles. Firstly, contrastive learning typically requires negative sampling to avoid the representation collapse issue, where the encoder converges to a constant solution. However, drawing from the same dataset for dissimilar samples is ill-suited for TSAD as most samples are ``normal'' in the training dataset. Secondly, conventional contrastive learning focuses on instance discrimination, which may overlook anomalies that are detectable when compared to their temporal context. In this study, we propose a novel approach, CNT, that incorporates a window-based contrastive learning strategy fortified with learnable transformations. This dual configuration focuses on capturing temporal anomalies in local regions while simultaneously mitigating the representation collapse issue. Our theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness of CNT in circumventing constant encoder solutions. Through extensive experiments on diverse real-world industrial datasets, we show the superiority of our framework by outperforming various baselines and model variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> | None |

We leverage standard and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders trained on normal operational data and tested with real anomaly-revealing data. We then provide a projection of the inference results on a lower-dimension data map generated by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which serves as an unsupervised baseline and shows the distribution of the identified anomalies. We also develop lightweight surrogate models using random forest and decision tree to promote transparency and interpretability for the inference results of the deep learning models and assist the engineer with an agile assessment of the flagged anomalies. The approach is empirically evaluated using real data from TUCANA. The empirical results show higher performance of the LSTM autoencoder -- as the anomaly detection module with effective capturing of temporal dependencies in the data -- and demonstrate the practicality of the lightweight surrogate models in providing helpful interpretability, which leads to higher efficiency for the engineer's decision-making.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Automated Self-Supervised Learning for Truly Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14694v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging paradigm that exploits supervisory signals generated from the data itself, and many recent studies have leveraged SSL to conduct graph anomaly detection. However, we empirically found that three important factors can substantially impact detection performance across datasets: 1) the specific SSL strategy employed; 2) the tuning of the strategy's hyperparameters; and 3) the allocation of combination weights when using multiple strategies. Most SSL-based graph anomaly detection methods circumvent these issues by arbitrarily or selectively (i.e., guided by label information) choosing SSL strategies, hyperparameter settings, and combination weights. While an arbitrary choice may lead to subpar performance, using label information in an unsupervised setting is label information leakage and leads to severe overestimation of a method's performance. Leakage has been criticized as "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", yet many recent studies on SSL-based graph anomaly detection have been using label information to select hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose to use an internal evaluation strategy (with theoretical analysis) to select hyperparameters in SSL for unsupervised anomaly detection. We perform extensive experiments using 10 recent SSL-based graph anomaly detection algorithms on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating both the prior issues with hyperparameter selection and the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in May 2024 for possible publication.

| **[Polynomial Selection in Spectral Graph Neural Networks: An Error-Sum of Function Slices Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15354v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral graph neural networks are proposed to harness spectral information inherent in graph-structured data through the application of polynomial-defined graph filters, recently achieving notable success in graph-based web applications. Existing studies reveal that various polynomial choices greatly impact spectral GNN performance, underscoring the importance of polynomial selection. However, this selection process remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Although prior work suggests a connection between the approximation capabilities of polynomials and the efficacy of spectral GNNs, there is a lack of theoretical insights into this relationship, rendering polynomial selection a largely heuristic process. To address the issue, this paper examines polynomial selection from an error-sum of function slices perspective. Inspired by the conventional signal decomposition, we represent graph filters as a sum of disjoint function slices. Building on this, we then bridge the polynomial capability and spectral GNN efficacy by proving that the construction error of graph convolution layer is bounded by the sum of polynomial approximation errors on function slices. This result leads us to develop an advanced filter based on trigonometric polynomials, a widely adopted option for approximating narrow signal slices. The proposed filter remains provable parameter efficiency, with a novel Taylor-based parameter decomposition that achieves streamlined, effective implementation. With this foundation, we propose TFGNN, a scalable spectral GNN operating in a decoupled paradigm. We validate the efficacy of TFGNN via benchmark node classification tasks, along with an example graph anomaly detection application to show its practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM The Web Conference 2025, WWW 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11430v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the student-teacher (S-T) framework effectively addresses this challenge. However, most S-T frameworks rely solely on pre-trained teacher networks to guide student networks in learning multi-scale similar features, overlooking the potential of the student networks to enhance learning through multi-scale feature fusion. In this study, we propose a novel model named PFADSeg, which integrates a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student network with multi-scale feature fusion, and a guided anomaly segmentation network into a unified framework. By adopting a unique teacher-encoder and student-decoder denoising mode, the model improves the student network's ability to learn from teacher network features. Furthermore, an adaptive feature fusion mechanism is introduced to train a self-supervised segmentation network that synthesizes anomaly masks autonomously, significantly increasing detection performance. Evaluated on the MVTec AD dataset, PFADSeg achieves state-of-the-art results with an image-level AUC of 98.9%, a pixel-level mean precision of 76.4%, and an instance-level mean precision of 78.7%.</p></details> |  | None |

Most previous studies are model-driven, focusing on enhancing the detection effect by improving the model structure. However, these approaches often treat all nodes equally, neglecting the different contributions of various nodes to the training. Therefore, we introduce graph curriculum learning as a simple and effective plug-and-play module to optimize GAD methods. The existing graph curriculum learning mainly focuses on the homogeneity of graphs and treats nodes with high homogeneity as easy nodes. In fact, GAD models can handle not only graph homogeneity but also heterogeneity, which leads to the unsuitability of these existing methods. To address this problem, we propose an innovative Bi-directional Curriculum Learning strategy (BCL), which considers nodes with higher and lower similarity to neighbor nodes as simple nodes in the direction of focusing on homogeneity and focusing on heterogeneity, respectively, and prioritizes their training. Extensive experiments show that BCL can be quickly integrated into existing detection processes and significantly improves the performance of ten GAD anomaly detection models on seven commonly used datasets.</p></details> | 8pages, 5 figures | None |

However, existing systems often struggle to simultaneously achieve explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy, which are three indispensable properties for production use. We introduce Argos, an agentic system for detecting time-series anomalies in cloud infrastructure by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Argos proposes to use explainable and reproducible anomaly rules as intermediate representation and employs LLMs to autonomously generate such rules. The system will efficiently train error-free and accuracy-guaranteed anomaly rules through multiple collaborative agents and deploy the trained rules for low-cost online anomaly detection. Through evaluation results, we demonstrate that Argos outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing $F_1$ scores by up to $9.5\%$ and $28.3\%$ on public anomaly detection datasets and an internal dataset collected from Microsoft, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection are Unreliable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13864v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders are frequently used for anomaly detection, both in the unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. They rely on the assumption that when trained using the reconstruction loss, they will be able to reconstruct normal data more accurately than anomalous data. Some recent works have posited that this assumption may not always hold, but little has been done to study the validity of the assumption in theory. In this work we show that this assumption indeed does not hold, and illustrate that anomalies, lying far away from normal data, can be perfectly reconstructed in practice. We revisit the theory of failure of linear autoencoders for anomaly detection by showing how they can perfectly reconstruct out of bounds, or extrapolate undesirably, and note how this can be dangerous in safety critical applications. We connect this to non-linear autoencoders through experiments on both tabular data and real-world image data, the two primary application areas of autoencoders for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

For example, mechanical ventilators are critical life-support machines, but they can cause serious injury to patients if they are out of synchronization with the patients' own breathing reflex. This asynchrony is revealed by the waveforms showing flow and pressure histories. Likewise, electrocardiograms record the electrical activity of a patients' heart as a set of waveforms, and anomalous waveforms can reveal important disease states. In both cases, subtle variations in a complex waveform are important information for patient care; signals which may be missed or mis-interpreted by human caregivers. We report on the design of a novel Lock Generative Adversarial Network architecture for anomaly detection in raw or summarized medical waveform data. The proposed architecture uses alternating optimization of the generator and discriminator networks to solve the convergence dilemma. Furthermore, the fidelity of the generator networks' outputs to the actual distribution of anomalous data is improved via synthetic minority oversampling. We evaluate this new architecture on one ventilator asynchrony dataset, and two electrocardiogram datasets, finding that the performance was either equal or superior to the state-of-the art on all three.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures | None |

Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

This shift introduces complexities in grid operation and increases vulnerability to cyberattacks. This research explores the application of digital twin (DT) technology and machine learning (ML) techniques for anomaly detection in PEDGs. A DT can accurately track and simulate the behavior of the physical grid in real-time, providing a platform for monitoring and analyzing grid operations, with extended amount of data about dynamic power flow along the whole power system. By integrating ML algorithms, the DT can learn normal grid behavior and effectively identify anomalies that deviate from established patterns, enabling early detection of potential cyberattacks or system faults. This approach offers a comprehensive and proactive strategy for enhancing cybersecurity and ensuring the stability and reliability of PEDGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint accepted to 2025 Conference of Young Researchers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (2025 ElCon)</p></details> | None |
| **[Guided Reconstruction with Conditioned Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04215v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of supervised models to clinical screening tasks is challenging due to the need for annotated data for each considered pathology. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is an alternative approach that aims to identify any anomaly as an outlier from a healthy training distribution. A prevalent strategy for UAD in brain MRI involves using generative models to learn the reconstruction of healthy brain anatomy for a given input image. As these models should fail to reconstruct unhealthy structures, the reconstruction errors indicate anomalies. However, a significant challenge is to balance the accurate reconstruction of healthy anatomy and the undesired replication of abnormal structures. While diffusion models have shown promising results with detailed and accurate reconstructions, they face challenges in preserving intensity characteristics, resulting in false positives. We propose conditioning the denoising process of diffusion models with additional information derived from a latent representation of the input image. We demonstrate that this conditioning allows for accurate and local adaptation to the general input intensity distribution while avoiding the replication of unhealthy structures. We compare the novel approach to different state-of-the-art methods and for different data sets. Our results show substantial improvements in the segmentation performance, with the Dice score improved by 11.9%, 20.0%, and 44.6%, for the BraTS, ATLAS and MSLUB data sets, respectively, while maintaining competitive performance on the WMH data set. Furthermore, our results indicate effective domain adaptation across different MRI acquisitions and simulated contrasts, an important attribute for general anomaly detection methods.

Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unraveling Normal Anatomy via Fluid-Driven Anomaly Randomization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13370v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven machine learning has made significant strides in medical image analysis. However, most existing methods are tailored to specific modalities and assume a particular resolution (often isotropic). This limits their generalizability in clinical settings, where variations in scan appearance arise from differences in sequence parameters, resolution, and orientation. Furthermore, most general-purpose models are designed for healthy subjects and suffer from performance degradation when pathology is present. We introduce UNA (Unraveling Normal Anatomy), the first modality-agnostic learning approach for normal brain anatomy reconstruction that can handle both healthy scans and cases with pathology. We propose a fluid-driven anomaly randomization method that generates an unlimited number of realistic pathology profiles on-the-fly. UNA is trained on a combination of synthetic and real data, and can be applied directly to real images with potential pathology without the need for fine-tuning. We demonstrate UNA's effectiveness in reconstructing healthy brain anatomy and showcase its direct application to anomaly detection, using both simulated and real images from 3D healthy and stroke datasets, including CT and MRI scans. By bridging the gap between healthy and diseased images, UNA enables the use of general-purpose models on diseased images, opening up new opportunities for large-scale analysis of uncurated clinical images in the presence of pathology.

While state of the art relies on digital and analog side channel measurements assuming trustworthiness of measurements obtained on the main processor, such an approach has limitations since processor-based side channel measurements are potentially untrustworthy. Sophisticated adversaries (especially in late stage cyber attacks when they have breached the computer and network security systems such as firewalls and antivirus and penetrated the computer's OS) can compromise user-space and kernel-space measurements. To address this key limitation of state of the art, we propose a "subcomponent-level" approach to collect side channel measurements so as to enable robust anomaly detection in a modern computer even when the main processor is compromised. Our proposed approach leverages the fact that modern computers are complex systems with multiple interacting subcomponents and measurements from subcomponents can be used to detect anomalies even when the main processor is no longer trustworthy. We develop mechanisms to obtain time series measurements of activity of several subcomponents and methodologies to process and fuse these measurements for anomaly detection. The subcomponents include network interface controller, GPU, CPU Hardware Performance Counters, CPU power, and keyboard. Our main hypothesis is that subcomponent measurements can enable detection of security threats without requiring a trustworthy main processor. By enabling real-time measurements from multiple subcomponents, the goal is to provide a deeper visibility into system operation, thereby yielding a powerful tool to track system operation and detect anomalies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 29 figures | None |

However, confidentiality concerns hinder data sharing among audit firms. Although the federated learning (FL)-based approach, FedAvg, has been proposed to address this challenge, its use of mutiple communication rounds increases its overhead, limiting its practicality. In this study, we propose a novel framework employing Data Collaboration (DC) analysis -- a non-model share-type FL method -- to streamline model training into a single communication round. Our method first encodes journal entry data via dimensionality reduction to obtain secure intermediate representations, then transforms them into collaboration representations for building an autoencoder that detects anomalies. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic dataset and real journal entry data from multiple organizations. The results show that our method not only outperforms single-organization baselines but also exceeds FedAvg in non-i.i.d. experiments on real journal entry data that closely mirror real-world conditions. By preserving data confidentiality and reducing iterative communication, this study addresses a key auditing challenge -- ensuring data confidentiality while integrating knowledge from multiple audit firms. Our findings represent a significant advance in artificial intelligence-driven auditing and underscore the potential of FL methods in high-security domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection by Capturing Coarse-Grained Intra- and Inter-Variate Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16364v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series anomaly detection is essential for failure management in web application operations, as it directly influences the effectiveness and timeliness of implementing remedial or preventive measures. This task is often framed as a semi-supervised learning problem, where only normal data are available for model training, primarily due to the labor-intensive nature of data labeling and the scarcity of anomalous data. Existing semi-supervised methods often detect anomalies by capturing intra-variate temporal dependencies and/or inter-variate relationships to learn normal patterns, flagging timestamps that deviate from these patterns as anomalies. However, these approaches often fail to capture salient intra-variate temporal and inter-variate dependencies in time series due to their focus on excessively fine granularity, leading to suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce MtsCID, a novel semi-supervised multivariate time series anomaly detection method. MtsCID employs a dual network architecture: one network operates on the attention maps of multi-scale intra-variate patches for coarse-grained temporal dependency learning, while the other works on variates to capture coarse-grained inter-variate relationships through convolution and interaction with sinusoidal prototypes. This design enhances the ability to capture the patterns from both intra-variate temporal dependencies and inter-variate relationships, resulting in improved performance. Extensive experiments across seven widely used datasets demonstrate that MtsCID achieves performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art benchmark methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to TheWebConference 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite recent advancements in the efficient and unified one-for-all scheme, challenges persist in accurately segmenting anomalies for further monitoring. Moreover, this problem is obscured by the widely-used AUROC metric under imbalanced UAD settings. This motivates us to emphasize the significance of precise segmentation of anomaly pixels using pAP and DSC as metrics. To address the unsolved segmentation task, we introduce the Unified Anomaly Segmentation (UniAS). UniAS presents a multi-level hybrid pipeline that progressively enhances normal information from coarse to fine, incorporating a novel multi-granularity gated CNN (MGG-CNN) into Transformer layers to explicitly aggregate local details from different granularities. UniAS achieves state-of-the-art anomaly segmentation performance, attaining 65.12/59.33 and 40.06/32.50 in pAP/DSC on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, respectively, surpassing previous methods significantly.

We focus on the case where the inlier distribution is defined by a training dataset and there exists no additional knowledge about the novelties that one is likely to encounter. This problem is also referred to as novelty detection, one-class classification, and unsupervised anomaly detection. The current literature suggests that contrastive learning techniques are state-of-the-art for OOD detection. We aim to improve on those techniques by combining/ensembling their scores using the framework of null hypothesis testing and, in particular, a novel generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). We demonstrate that our proposed GLRT-based technique outperforms the state-of-the-art CSI and SupCSI techniques from Tack et al. 2020 in dataset-vs-dataset experiments with CIFAR-10, SVHN, LSUN, ImageNet, and CIFAR-100, as well as leave-one-class-out experiments with CIFAR-10.

Traditional window-based methods for log anomaly detection often suffer from context bias and fuzzy localization, which hinder their ability to precisely and efficiently identify anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose a graph-centric framework, TempoLog, which leverages multi-scale temporal graph networks for discrete log anomaly detection. Unlike conventional methods, TempoLog constructs continuous-time dynamic graphs directly from event logs, eliminating the need for fixed-size window grouping. By representing log templates as nodes and their temporal relationships as edges, the framework dynamically captures both local and global dependencies across multiple temporal scales. Additionally, a semantic-aware model enhances detection by incorporating rich contextual information. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in event-level anomaly detection, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

In practice, situations often involve a mix of segment-level labels (detected abnormal events with segments of time points) and unlabeled data (undetected events), while the ideal algorithmic outcome should be point-level predictions. Therefore, the huge label information gap between training data and targets makes the task challenging. In this study, we formulate the above imperfect information as noisy labels and propose NRdetector, a noise-resilient framework that incorporates confidence-based sample selection, robust segment-level learning, and data-centric point-level detection for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Particularly, to bridge the information gap between noisy segment-level labels and missing point-level labels, we develop a novel loss function that can effectively mitigate the label noise and consider the temporal features. It encourages the smoothness of consecutive points and the separability of points from segments with different labels. Extensive experiments on real-world multivariate time series datasets with 11 different evaluation metrics demonstrate that NRdetector consistently achieves robust results across multiple real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines adapted to operate in our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'25)</p></details> | None |

Although empirical remedies exist, it is often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory. We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI and offer practical guidelines to address it.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures | None |

In particular, world models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. Such models unify perception, prediction, and planning, thereby enabling autonomous systems to make rapid, informed decisions under complex and often unpredictable conditions. Research trends span diverse areas, including 4D occupancy prediction and generative data synthesis, all of which bolster scene understanding and trajectory forecasting. Notably, recent works exploit large-scale pretraining and advanced self-supervised learning to scale up models' capacity for rare-event simulation and real-time interaction. In addressing key challenges -- ranging from domain adaptation and long-tail anomaly detection to multimodal fusion -- these world models pave the way for more robust, reliable, and adaptable autonomous driving solutions. This survey systematically reviews the state of the art, categorizing techniques by their focus on future prediction, behavior planning, and the interaction between the two. We also identify potential directions for future research, emphasizing holistic integration, improved computational efficiency, and advanced simulation. Our comprehensive analysis underscores the transformative role of world models in driving next-generation autonomous systems toward safer and more equitable mobility.</p></details> | Ongoing project | None |

The benchmark setup for this task is extremely challenging due to: i) the limited size of the training sets, ii) weak supervision provided in terms of video-level labels, and iii) intrinsic class imbalance induced by the scarcity of abnormal events. In this work, we show that distilling knowledge from aggregated representations of multiple backbones into a single-backbone Student model achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we develop a bi-level distillation approach along with a novel disentangled cross-attention-based feature aggregation network. Our proposed approach, DAKD (Distilling Aggregated Knowledge with Disentangled Attention), demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, we achieve significant improvements of 1.36%, 0.78%, and 7.02% on the UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and XD-Violence datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FiLo++: Zero-/Few-Shot Anomaly Detection by Fused Fine-Grained Descriptions and Deformable Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10067v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection methods typically require extensive normal samples from the target class for training, limiting their applicability in scenarios that require rapid adaptation, such as cold start. Zero-shot and few-shot anomaly detection do not require labeled samples from the target class in advance, making them a promising research direction. Existing zero-shot and few-shot approaches often leverage powerful multimodal models to detect and localize anomalies by comparing image-text similarity. However, their handcrafted generic descriptions fail to capture the diverse range of anomalies that may emerge in different objects, and simple patch-level image-text matching often struggles to localize anomalous regions of varying shapes and sizes. To address these issues, this paper proposes the FiLo++ method, which consists of two key components. The first component, Fused Fine-Grained Descriptions (FusDes), utilizes large language models to generate anomaly descriptions for each object category, combines both fixed and learnable prompt templates and applies a runtime prompt filtering method, producing more accurate and task-specific textual descriptions. The second component, Deformable Localization (DefLoc), integrates the vision foundation model Grounding DINO with position-enhanced text descriptions and a Multi-scale Deformable Cross-modal Interaction (MDCI) module, enabling accurate localization of anomalies with various shapes and sizes. In addition, we design a position-enhanced patch matching approach to improve few-shot anomaly detection performance. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that FiLo++ achieves significant performance improvements compared with existing methods.

On the contrary, large multimodal models~(LMMs) have shown eminent generalization ability on various vision tasks, and their perception and comprehension capabilities imply the potential of applying LMMs on IAD tasks. However, we observe that even though the LMMs have abundant knowledge about industrial anomaly detection in the textual domain, the LMMs are unable to leverage the knowledge due to the modality gap between textual and visual domains. To stimulate the relevant knowledge in LMMs and adapt the LMMs towards anomaly detection tasks, we introduce existing IAD methods as vision experts and present a novel large multimodal model applying vision experts for industrial anomaly detection~(abbreviated to {Myriad}). Specifically, we utilize the anomaly map generated by the vision experts as guidance for LMMs, such that the vision model is guided to pay more attention to anomalous regions. Then, the visual features are modulated via an adapter to fit the anomaly detection tasks, which are fed into the language model together with the vision expert guidance and human instructions to generate the final outputs. Extensive experiments are applied on MVTec-AD, VisA, and PCB Bank benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method not only performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods, but also inherits the flexibility and instruction-following ability of LMMs in the field of IAD.

In addition, we propose a novel method to detect complex anomalies via modeling the interactions between objects using a scene graph with spatio-temporal attributes.

| **[Sequential PatchCore: Anomaly Detection for Surface Inspection using Synthetic Impurities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09579v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The appearance of surface impurities (e.g., water stains, fingerprints, stickers) is an often-mentioned issue that causes degradation of automated visual inspection systems. At the same time, synthetic data generation techniques for visual surface inspection have focused primarily on generating perfect examples and defects, disregarding impurities. This study highlights the importance of considering impurities when generating synthetic data. We introduce a procedural method to include photorealistic water stains in synthetic data. The synthetic datasets are generated to correspond to real datasets and are further used to train an anomaly detection model and investigate the influence of water stains. The high-resolution images used for surface inspection lead to memory bottlenecks during anomaly detection training. To address this, we introduce Sequential PatchCore - a method to build coresets sequentially and make training on large images using consumer-grade hardware tractable. This allows us to perform transfer learning using coresets pre-trained on different dataset versions. Our results show the benefits of using synthetic data for pre-training an explicit coreset anomaly model and the extended performance benefits of finetuning the coreset using real data. We observed how the impurities and labelling ambiguity lower the model performance and have additionally reported the defect-wise recall to provide an industrially relevant perspective on model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Reliability journal</p></details> | None |

No previous work investigated the relationship between the behavioral uncertainty of a UAV and the unsafety of its flight. By quantifying uncertainty, it is possible to develop a predictor for unsafety, which acts as a flight supervisor. We conducted a large-scale empirical investigation of safety violations using PX4-Autopilot, an open-source UAV software platform. Our dataset of over 5,000 simulated flights, created to challenge obstacle avoidance, allowed us to explore the relation between uncertain UAV decisions and safety violations: up to 89% of unsafe UAV states exhibit significant decision uncertainty, and up to 74% of uncertain decisions lead to unsafe states. Based on these findings, we implemented Superialist (Supervising Autonomous Aerial Vehicles), a runtime uncertainty detector based on autoencoders, the state-of-the-art technology for anomaly detection. Superialist achieved high performance in detecting uncertain behaviors with up to 96% precision and 93% recall. Despite the observed performance degradation when using the same approach for predicting unsafety (up to 74% precision and 87% recall), Superialist enabled early prediction of unsafe states up to 50 seconds in advance.</p></details> | 36 pages | None |
| **[Industrial Anomaly Detection and Localization Using Weakly-Supervised Residual Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03492v6)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in industrial anomaly detection (AD) have demonstrated that incorporating a small number of anomalous samples during training can significantly enhance accuracy. However, this improvement often comes at the cost of extensive annotation efforts, which are impractical for many real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Weak}ly-supervised RESidual Transformer (WeakREST), designed to achieve high anomaly detection accuracy while minimizing the reliance on manual annotations. First, we reformulate the pixel-wise anomaly localization task into a block-wise classification problem. Second, we introduce a residual-based feature representation called Positional Fast Anomaly Residuals (PosFAR) which captures anomalous patterns more effectively. To leverage this feature, we adapt the Swin Transformer for enhanced anomaly detection and localization. Additionally, we propose a weak annotation approach, utilizing bounding boxes and image tags to define anomalous regions. This approach establishes a semi-supervised learning context that reduces the dependency on precise pixel-level labels. To further improve the learning process, we develop a novel ResMixMatch algorithm, capable of handling the interplay between weak labels and residual-based representations. On the benchmark dataset MVTec-AD, our method achieves an Average Precision (AP) of $83.0\%$, surpassing the previous best result of $82.7\%$ in the unsupervised setting. In the supervised AD setting, WeakREST attains an AP of $87.6\%$, outperforming the previous best of $86.0\%$. Notably, even when using weaker annotations such as bounding boxes, WeakREST exceeds the performance of leading methods relying on pixel-wise supervision, achieving an AP of $87.1\%$ compared to the prior best of $86.0\%$ on MVTec-AD.</p></details> | 13 pages,7 figures | None |

Compared with existing models that passively detect specific anomaly classes with large labeled training samples, user-level network traffic contains sizeable new anomaly classes with few labeled samples and has an imbalance, self-similar, and data-hungry nature. Motivation on those limitations, in this paper, we propose \textit{Meta-UAD}, a Meta-learning scheme for User-level network traffic Anomaly Detection. Meta-UAD uses the CICFlowMeter to extract 81 flow-level statistical features and remove some invalid ones using cumulative importance ranking. Meta-UAD adopts a meta-learning training structure and learns from the collection of K-way-M-shot classification tasks, which can use a pre-trained model to adapt any new class with few samples by few iteration steps. We evaluate our scheme on two public datasets. Compared with existing models, the results further demonstrate the superiority of Meta-UAD with 15{\%} - 43{\%} gains in F1-score.</p></details> | Accepted | None |
| **[Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08628v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data. Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance. Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

As a side benefit, the high-resolution discovered regions learned by the model also provide explainable normalcy maps for human operators without the need for any pre-trained segmentation model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Parameter-Efficient Quantum Anomaly Detection Method on a Superconducting Quantum Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16867v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum machine learning has gained attention for its potential to address computational challenges. However, whether those algorithms can effectively solve practical problems and outperform their classical counterparts, especially on current quantum hardware, remains a critical question. In this work, we propose a novel quantum machine learning method, called Quantum Support Vector Data Description (QSVDD), for practical image anomaly detection, which aims to achieve both parameter efficiency and superior accuracy compared to classical models. Emulation results indicate that QSVDD demonstrates favourable recognition capabilities compared to classical baselines, achieving an average accuracy of over 90% on benchmarks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that QSVDD has a comparable expressivity to classical counterparts while requiring only a fraction of the parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first implementation of a quantum anomaly detection method for general image datasets on a superconducting quantum processor. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of over 80% with only 16 parameters on the device, providing initial evidence of QSVDD's practical viability in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era and highlighting its significant reduction in parameter requirements.</p></details> | 30 pages, 13 figures | None |
| **[Multiple-Input Variational Auto-Encoder for Anomaly Detection in Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08149v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role in AI applications, e.g., in classification, and intrusion/threat detection in cybersecurity. However, most existing methods face challenges of heterogeneity amongst feature subsets posed by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose a novel neural network model called Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder for AD (MIAEAD) to address this. MIAEAD assigns an anomaly score to each feature subset of a data sample to indicate its likelihood of being an anomaly. This is done by using the reconstruction error of its sub-encoder as the anomaly score. All sub-encoders are then simultaneously trained using unsupervised learning to determine the anomaly scores of feature subsets. The final AUC of MIAEAD is calculated for each sub-dataset, and the maximum AUC obtained among the sub-datasets is selected. To leverage the modelling of the distribution of normal data to identify anomalies of the generative models, we develop a novel neural network architecture/model called Multiple-Input Variational Auto-Encoder (MIVAE). MIVAE can process feature subsets through its sub-encoders before learning distribution of normal data in the latent space. This allows MIVAE to identify anomalies that deviate from the learned distribution. We theoretically prove that the difference in the average anomaly score between normal samples and anomalies obtained by the proposed MIVAE is greater than that of the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAEAD), resulting in a higher AUC for MIVAE. Extensive experiments on eight real-world anomaly datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MIAEAD and MIVAE over conventional methods and the state-of-the-art unsupervised models, by up to 6% in terms of AUC score. Alternatively, MIAEAD and MIVAE have a high AUC when applied to feature subsets with low heterogeneity based on the coefficient of variation (CV) score.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[ONER: Online Experience Replay for Incremental Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03907v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incremental anomaly detection sequentially recognizes abnormal regions in novel categories for dynamic industrial scenarios. This remains highly challenging due to knowledge overwriting and feature conflicts, leading to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose ONER, an end-to-end ONline Experience Replay method, which efficiently mitigates catastrophic forgetting while adapting to new tasks with minimal cost. Specifically, our framework utilizes two types of experiences from past tasks: decomposed prompts and semantic prototypes, addressing both model parameter updates and feature optimization. The decomposed prompts consist of learnable components that assemble to produce attention-conditioned prompts. These prompts reuse previously learned knowledge, enabling model to learn novel tasks effectively. The semantic prototypes operate at both pixel and image levels, performing regularization in the latent feature space to prevent forgetting across various tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in incremental anomaly detection with significantly reduced forgetting, as well as efficiently adapting to new categories with minimal costs. These results confirm the efficiency and stability of ONER, making it a powerful solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[STTS-EAD: Improving Spatio-Temporal Learning Based Time Series Prediction via](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07814v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling anomalies is a critical preprocessing step in multivariate time series prediction. However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> | None |

LLMs are critical for various applications, but they often suffer from hallucinations and inaccuracies due to knowledge gaps in the training data. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as a powerful structural tool, could serve as a vital external information source to mitigate the aforementioned issues. By providing a structured and comprehensive understanding of real-world data, KGs enhance the performance and reliability of LLMs. However, it is common that errors exist in KGs while extracting triplets from unstructured data to construct KGs. This could lead to degraded performance in downstream tasks such as question-answering and recommender systems. Therefore, anomaly detection in KGs is essential to identify and correct these errors. This paper presents an anomaly detection algorithm in knowledge graphs with dual-channel learning (ADKGD). ADKGD leverages a dual-channel learning approach to enhance representation learning from both the entity-view and triplet-view perspectives. Furthermore, using a cross-layer approach, our framework integrates internal information aggregation and context information aggregation. We introduce a kullback-leibler (KL)-loss component to improve the accuracy of the scoring function between the dual channels. To evaluate ADKGD's performance, we conduct empirical studies on three real-world KGs: WN18RR, FB15K, and NELL-995.

Training with noisy data is an inevitable problem in real-world anomaly detection but is seldom discussed. This paper is the first to consider fully unsupervised industrial anomaly detection (i.e., unsupervised AD with noisy data). To solve this problem, we proposed memory-based unsupervised AD methods, SoftPatch and SoftPatch+, which efficiently denoise the data at the patch level. Noise discriminators are utilized to generate outlier scores for patch-level noise elimination before coreset construction. The scores are then stored in the memory bank to soften the anomaly detection boundary. Compared with existing methods, SoftPatch maintains a strong modeling ability of normal data and alleviates the overconfidence problem in coreset, and SoftPatch+ has more robust performance which is articularly useful in real-world industrial inspection scenarios with high levels of noise (from 10% to 40%). Comprehensive experiments conducted in diverse noise scenarios demonstrate that both SoftPatch and SoftPatch+ outperform the state-of-the-art AD methods on the MVTecAD, ViSA, and BTAD benchmarks. Furthermore, the performance of SoftPatch and SoftPatch+ is comparable to that of the noise-free methods in conventional unsupervised AD setting.

Recent studies have incorporated graph learning techniques to extract detailed information from provenance graphs, enabling the detection of attacks with greater granularity. Nevertheless, existing studies have largely overlooked the continuous yet subtle temporal variations in the structure of provenance graphs, which may correspond to surreptitious perturbation anomalies in ongoing APT attacks. Therefore, we introduce TFLAG, an advanced anomaly detection framework that for the first time integrates the structural dynamic extraction capabilities of temporal graph model with the anomaly delineation abilities of deviation networks to pinpoint covert attack activities in provenance graphs. This self-supervised integration framework leverages the graph model to extract neighbor interaction data under continuous temporal changes from historical benign behaviors within provenance graphs, while simultaneously utilizing deviation networks to accurately distinguish authentic attack activities from false positive deviations due to unexpected subtle perturbations. The experimental results indicate that, through a comprehensive design that utilizes both attribute and temporal information, it can accurately identify the time windows associated with APT attack behaviors without prior knowledge (e.g., labeled data samples), demonstrating superior accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods in differentiating between attack events and system false positive events.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Driver Age and Its Effect on Key Driving Metrics: Insights from Dynamic Vehicle Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06918v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By 2030, the senior population aged 65 and older is expected to increase by over 50%, significantly raising the number of older drivers on the road. Drivers over 70 face higher crash death rates compared to those in their forties and fifties, underscoring the importance of developing more effective safety interventions for this demographic. Although the impact of aging on driving behavior has been studied, there is limited research on how these behaviors translate into real-world driving scenarios. This study addresses this need by leveraging Naturalistic Driving Data (NDD) to analyze driving performance measures - specifically, speed limit adherence on interstates and deceleration at stop intersections, both of which may be influenced by age-related declines. Using NDD, we developed Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) to establish benchmarks for key driving behaviors among senior and young drivers. Our analysis, which included anomaly detection, benchmark comparisons, and accuracy evaluations, revealed significant differences in driving patterns primarily related to speed limit adherence at 75mph. While our approach shows promising potential for enhancing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by providing tailored interventions based on age-specific adherence to speed limit driving patterns, we recognize the need for additional data to refine and validate metrics for other driving behaviors. By establishing precise benchmarks for various driving performance metrics, ADAS can effectively identify anomalies, such as abrupt deceleration, which may indicate impaired driving or other safety concerns. This study lays a strong foundation for future research aimed at improving safety interventions through detailed driving behavior analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 4 Tables, 104th TRB Annual Meeting 2025, Washington DC</p></details> | None |
| **[Generative AI Enabled Robust Sensor Placement in Cyber-Physical Power Systems: A Graph Diffusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06756v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advancements in physical power systems and network technologies, integrated Cyber-Physical Power Systems (CPPS) have significantly enhanced system monitoring and control efficiency and reliability. This integration, however, introduces complex challenges in designing coherent CPPS, particularly as few studies concurrently address the deployment of physical layers and communication connections in the cyber layer. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a framework for robust sensor placement to optimize anomaly detection in the physical layer and enhance communication resilience in the cyber layer. We model the CPPS as an interdependent network via a graph, allowing for simultaneous consideration of both layers. Then, we adopt the Log-normal Shadowing Path Loss (LNSPL) model to ensure reliable data transmission. Additionally, we leverage the Fiedler value to measure graph resilience against line failures and three anomaly detectors to fortify system safety. However, the optimization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we introduce the Experience Feedback Graph Diffusion (EFGD) algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion process to generate optimal sensor placement strategies. This algorithm incorporates cross-entropy gradient and experience feedback mechanisms to expedite convergence and generate higher reward strategies. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the EFGD algorithm enhances model convergence by 18.9% over existing graph diffusion methods and improves average reward by 22.90% compared to Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) and 19.57% compared to Graph Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), thereby significantly bolstering the robustness and reliability of CPPS operations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures | None |

Traditional security measures often fall short, highlighting the need for intelligent solutions capable of detecting shoplifting behaviors in real time. This paper frames shoplifting detection as an anomaly detection problem, focusing on the identification of deviations from typical shopping patterns. We introduce PoseLift, a privacy-preserving dataset specifically designed for shoplifting detection, addressing challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and model biases. PoseLift is built in collaboration with a retail store and contains anonymized human pose data from real-world scenarios. By preserving essential behavioral information while anonymizing identities, PoseLift balances privacy and utility. We benchmark state-of-the-art pose-based anomaly detection models on this dataset, evaluating performance using a comprehensive set of metrics. Our results demonstrate that pose-based approaches achieve high detection accuracy while effectively addressing privacy and bias concerns inherent in traditional methods. As one of the first datasets capturing real-world shoplifting behaviors, PoseLift offers researchers a valuable tool to advance computer vision ethically and will be publicly available to foster innovation and collaboration.

Despite the existence of many detectors to solve this problem, one cannot simply define why an obtained anomaly inferred by the detector is anomalous. This reasoning is required for network operators to understand the root cause of the anomaly and the remedial action that should be taken to counteract its occurrence. Existing solutions in explainable AI may give cues to features that influence an anomaly, but they do not formulate generalizable rules that can be assessed by a domain expert. Furthermore, not all outliers are anomalous in a business sense. There is an unfulfilled need for a system that can interpret anomalies predicted by a multivariate anomaly detector and map these patterns to actionable rules. This paper aims to fulfill this need by proposing a semi-autonomous anomaly rule miner. The proposed method is applicable to both discrete and time series data and is tailored for radio access network (RAN) anomaly detection use cases. The proposed method is demonstrated in this paper with time series RAN data.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised masked mesh learning for unsupervised anomaly detection in 3D cortical surfaces. Our framework leverages the intrinsic geometry of the cortical surface to learn a self-supervised representation that captures the underlying structure of the brain. We introduce a masked mesh convolutional neural network (MMN) that learns to predict masked regions of the cortical surface. By training the MMN on a large dataset of healthy subjects, we learn a representation that captures the normal variation in the cortical surface. We then use this representation to detect anomalies in unseen individuals by calculating anomaly scores based on the reconstruction error of the MMN. We evaluate our framework by training on population-scale dataset UKB and HCP-Aging and testing on two datasets of Alzheimer's disease patients ADNI and OASIS3. Our results show that our framework can detect anomalies in cortical thickness, cortical volume, and cortical sulcus features, which are known to be sensitive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Our proposed framework provides a promising approach for unsupervised anomaly detection based on normative variation of cortical features.</p></details> |  | None |

Machine learning, and specifically deep learning approaches, have been greatly successful in anomaly detection; however, they are black-box approaches that do not provide transparency or explanations. SHAP and its variants have been proposed to explain these models, but they suffer from high computational complexity (SHAP) or instability and inconsistency (e.g., Kernel SHAP). To address these challenges, this paper proposes an explainability approach for anomalies in energy consumption data that focuses on context-relevant information. The proposed approach leverages existing explainability techniques, focusing on SHAP variants, together with global feature importance and weighted cosine similarity to select background dataset based on the context of each anomaly point. By focusing on the context and most relevant features, this approach mitigates the instability of explainability algorithms. Experimental results across 10 different machine learning models, five datasets, and five XAI techniques, demonstrate that our method reduces the variability of explanations providing consistent explanations. Statistical analyses confirm the robustness of our approach, showing an average reduction in variability of approximately 38% across multiple datasets.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures | None |

In this paper, we provide a detailed study of UQ based on evidential deep learning (EDL) for deep neural network models designed to identify jets in high energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider and explore its utility in anomaly detection. EDL is a DL approach that treats learning as an evidence acquisition process designed to provide confidence (or epistemic uncertainty) about test data. Using publicly available datasets for jet classification benchmarking, we explore hyperparameter optimizations for EDL applied to the challenge of UQ for jet identification. We also investigate how the uncertainty is distributed for each jet class, how this method can be implemented for the detection of anomalies, how the uncertainty compares with Bayesian ensemble methods, and how the uncertainty maps onto latent spaces for the models. Our studies uncover some pitfalls of EDL applied to anomaly detection and a more effective way to quantify uncertainty from EDL as compared with the foundational EDL setup. These studies illustrate a methodological approach to interpreting EDL in jet classification models, providing new insights on how EDL quantifies uncertainty and detects out-of-distribution data which may lead to improved EDL methods for DL models applied to classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages (including references) with 17 figures and 3 tables.

To address the challenges posed by privacy preservation and decentralized power system zones with distinct data ownership, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution which facilitates collaborative training of attack detection models without necessitating the sharing of raw data. However, FL presents several implementation limitations in the power system domain due to its heavy reliance on a centralized aggregator and the risks of privacy leakage during model update transmission. To overcome these technical bottlenecks, this paper introduces a novel decentralized federated anomaly detection scheme based on two main gossip protocols namely Random Walk and Epidemic. Our findings indicate that the Random Walk protocol exhibits superior performance compared to the Epidemic protocol, highlighting its efficacy in decentralized federated learning environments. Experimental validation of the proposed framework utilizing publicly available industrial control systems datasets demonstrates superior attack detection accuracy while safeguarding data confidentiality and mitigating the impact of communication latency and stragglers. Furthermore, our approach yields a notable 35% improvement in training time compared to conventional FL, underscoring the efficacy and robustness of our decentralized learning method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches mostly treat log analysis as training a model to perform an isolated task ( e.g., anomaly detection, log parsing, etc.) using task-specific log-label pairs. These task-based approaches are inflexible in generalizing to complex scenarios, depend on task-specific training data, and cost significantly when deploying multiple models. In this paper, we propose an instruction-based training approach that transforms log-label pairs from multiple tasks and domains into a unified format of instruction-response pairs. Our trained model, LogLM, can follow complex user instructions and generalize better across different tasks, thereby increasing flexibility and reducing the dependence on task-specific training data. By integrating major log analysis tasks into a single model, our approach also relieves model deployment burden. Experimentally, LogLM outperforms existing approaches across five log analysis capabilities, and exhibits strong generalization abilities on complex instructions and unseen tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2025 (SEIP Track)</p></details> | None |

Confiscated seashells, cannot be returned to their ecosystems due to the lack of origin recognition. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically for seashell identification. We built a dataset from scratch, consisting of approximately 19000 images from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Using this dataset, the model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding 85%. The model has been integrated into a user-friendly application, which has classified over 36,000 seashells to date, delivering real-time results within 3 seconds per image. To further enhance the system's accuracy, an anomaly detection mechanism was incorporated to filter out irrelevant or anomalous inputs, ensuring only valid seashell images are processed.</p></details> |  | None |

Smart healthcare can deploy quantum machine learning to enable preventive and diagnostic support. This work introduces a unique technique to address stress detection as an anomaly detection problem that uses quantum hybrid support vector machines. With the help of a wearable smartwatch, we mapped baseline sensor reading as normal data and stressed sensor reading as anomaly data using cortisol concentration as the ground truth. We have used quantum computing techniques to explore the complex feature spaces with kernel-based preprocessing. We illustrate the usefulness of our method by doing experimental validation on 40 older adults with the help of the TSST protocol. Our findings highlight that using a limited number of features, quantum machine learning provides improved accuracy compared to classical methods. We also observed that the recall value using quantum machine learning is higher compared to the classical method. The higher recall value illustrates the potential of quantum machine learning in healthcare, as missing anomalies could result in delayed diagnostics or treatment.</p></details> |  | None |

The result is more frequent sudden failures, resulting in additional costs for these companies already operating in a very competitive market. Moreover, sawmills are challenging environments for machinery and sensors. Given that experienced machine operators may be able to diagnose defects or malfunctions, one possible way of assisting novice operators is through acoustic monitoring. As a step towards the automation of wood-processing equipment and decision support systems for machine operators, in this paper, we explore using a deep convolutional autoencoder for acoustic anomaly detection of wood planers on a new real-life dataset. Specifically, our convolutional autoencoder with skip connections (Skip-CAE) and our Skip-CAE transformer outperform the DCASE autoencoder baseline, one-class SVM, isolation forest and a published convolutional autoencoder architecture, respectively obtaining an area under the ROC curve of 0.846 and 0.875 on a dataset of real-factory planer sounds. Moreover, we show that adding skip connections and attention mechanism under the form of a transformer encoder-decoder helps to further improve the anomaly detection capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Registers in Vision Transformers for Robust Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04784v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown success across a variety of tasks due to their ability to capture global image representations. Recent studies have identified the existence of high-norm tokens in ViTs, which can interfere with unsupervised object discovery. To address this, the use of "registers" which are additional tokens that isolate high norm patch tokens while capturing global image-level information has been proposed. While registers have been studied extensively for object discovery, their generalization properties particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the utility of register token embeddings in providing additional features for improving generalization and anomaly rejection. To that end, we propose a simple method that combines the special CLS token embedding commonly employed in ViTs with the average-pooled register embeddings to create feature representations which are subsequently used for training a downstream classifier. We find that this enhances OOD generalization and anomaly rejection, while maintaining in-distribution (ID) performance. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones trained with and without registers reveal consistent improvements of 2-4\% in top-1 OOD accuracy and a 2-3\% reduction in false positive rates for anomaly detection. Importantly, these gains are achieved without additional computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |

This capability is essential in applications such as industrial inspection, where logical anomaly detection is critical for maintaining high-quality standards and minimizing costly recalls. Previous research in anomaly detection (AD) has relied on prior knowledge for designing algorithms, which often requires extensive manual annotations, significant computing power, and large amounts of data for training. Autoregressive, multimodal Vision Language Models (AVLMs) offer a promising alternative due to their exceptional performance in visual reasoning across various domains. Despite this, their application to logical AD remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate using AVLMs for logical AD and demonstrate that they are well-suited to the task. Combining AVLMs with format embedding and a logic reasoner, we achieve SOTA performance on public benchmarks, MVTec LOCO AD, with an AUROC of 86.0% and F1-max of 83.7%, along with explanations of anomalies. This significantly outperforms the existing SOTA method by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at aaai25, project page: https://jasonjin34.github.io/logicad.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://jasonjin34.github.io/logicad.github.io) |

The advantages of using NetFlow over deep packet inspection are that it is easier to collect and process, and it is less privacy intrusive. Many works have used machine learning to detect network attacks using NetFlow data. The first step for these machine learning pipelines is to pre-process the data before it is given to the machine learning algorithm. Many approaches exist to pre-process NetFlow data; however, these simply apply existing methods to the data, not considering the specific properties of network data. We argue that for data originating from software systems, such as NetFlow or software logs, similarities in frequency and contexts of feature values are more important than similarities in the value itself. In this work, we propose an encoding algorithm that directly takes the frequency and the context of the feature values into account when the data is being processed. Different types of network behaviours can be clustered using this encoding, thus aiding the process of detecting anomalies within the network. We train several machine learning models for anomaly detection using the data that has been encoded with our encoding algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of our encoding on a new dataset that we created for network attacks on Kubernetes clusters and two well-known public NetFlow datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the machine learning models benefit from using our encoding for anomaly detection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 17 figures | None |

Vision-language models like CLIP show potential in ZSAD but have limitations: relying on manually crafted fixed textual descriptions or anomaly prompts is time-consuming and prone to semantic ambiguity, and CLIP struggles with pixel-level anomaly segmentation, focusing more on global semantics than local details. To address these limitations, We introduce KAnoCLIP, a novel ZSAD framework that leverages vision-language models. KAnoCLIP combines general knowledge from a Large Language Model (GPT-3.5) and fine-grained, image-specific knowledge from a Visual Question Answering system (Llama3) via Knowledge-Driven Prompt Learning (KnPL). KnPL uses a knowledge-driven (KD) loss function to create learnable anomaly prompts, removing the need for fixed text prompts and enhancing generalization. KAnoCLIP includes the CLIP visual encoder with V-V attention (CLIP-VV), Bi-Directional Cross-Attention for Multi-Level Cross-Modal Interaction (Bi-CMCI), and Conv-Adapter. These components preserve local visual semantics, improve local cross-modal fusion, and align global visual features with textual information, enhancing pixel-level anomaly detection. KAnoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZSAD across 12 industrial and medical datasets, demonstrating superior generalization compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |

This research investigates the automation of SELinux policy analysis using graph-based techniques combined with machine learning approaches to detect policy anomalies. The study addresses two key questions: Can SELinux policy analysis be automated through graph analysis, and how do different anomaly detection models compare in analyzing SELinux policies? We will be comparing different machine learning models by evaluating their effectiveness in detecting policy violations and anomalies. Our approach utilizes Neo4j for graph representation of policies, with Node2vec transforming these graph structures into meaningful vector embeddings that can be processed by our machine learning models. In our results, the MLP Neural Network consistently demonstrated superior performance across different dataset sizes, achieving 95% accuracy with balanced precision and recall metrics, while both Random Forest and SVM models showed competitive but slightly lower performance in detecting policy violations. This combination of graph-based modeling and machine learning provides a more sophisticated and automated approach to understanding and analyzing complex SELinux policies compared to traditional manual analysis methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Applications of this control abound in drug discovery, forensics, anomaly detection, and, in particular, machine learning, ranging from nonparametric outlier detection to out-of-distribution detection and one-class classification methods. Considering this control could be relied upon in critical safety/security contexts, we investigate its adversarial robustness. More precisely, we study under what conditions BH does and does not exhibit adversarial robustness, we present a class of simple and easily implementable adversarial test-perturbation algorithms, and we perform computational experiments. With our algorithms, we demonstrate that there are conditions under which BH's control can be significantly broken with relatively few (even just one) test score perturbation(s), and provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the expected adversarial-adjustment to FDR. Our technical analysis involves a combinatorial reframing of the BH procedure as a ``balls into bins'' process, and drawing a connection to generalized ballot problems to facilitate an information-theoretic approach for deriving non-asymptotic lower bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

While this method of cultivation benefits from efficient resource utilization, anomalies can significantly degrade the quality of farm produce. A common anomaly associated with tomatoes is splitting, characterized by the development of cracks on the tomato skin, which degrades its quality. Detecting this type of anomaly is challenging due to dynamic variations in appearance and sizes, compounded by dataset scarcity. We address this problem in an unsupervised manner by utilizing a tailored variational autoencoder (VAE) with hyperspectral input. Preliminary analysis of the dataset enabled us to select the optimal range of wavelengths for detecting this anomaly. Our findings indicate that the 530nm - 550nm range is suitable for identifying tomato dry splits. The analysis on reconstruction loss allow us to not only detect the anomalies but also to some degree estimate the anomalous regions.</p></details> | CVPPA Workshop | None |

The rise of sophisticated threats like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) makes ensuring security in CPSSs particularly challenging. Provenance graph analysis has proven effective for tracing and detecting anomalies within systems, but the sheer size and complexity of these graphs hinder the efficiency of existing methods, especially those relying on graph neural networks (GNNs). To address these challenges, we present GraphDART, a modular framework designed to distill provenance graphs into compact yet informative representations, enabling scalable and effective anomaly detection. GraphDART can take advantage of diverse graph distillation techniques, including classic and modern graph distillation methods, to condense large provenance graphs while preserving essential structural and contextual information. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead, allowing GNNs to learn from distilled graphs efficiently and enhance detection performance. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the robustness of GraphDART in detecting malicious activities across cyber-physical-social systems.

In this paper, we describe an anomaly detection method for AI-generated faces by leveraging self-supervised learning of camera-intrinsic and face-specific features purely from photographic face images. The success of our method lies in designing a pretext task that trains a feature extractor to rank four ordinal exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tags and classify artificially manipulated face images. Subsequently, we model the learned feature distribution of photographic face images using a Gaussian mixture model. Faces with low likelihoods are flagged as AI-generated. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.

Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data processing and model adaptation. AAD has been researched in the literature extensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field. We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management, and algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the art and provide recommendations for future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Conventional anomaly detection approaches like signal processing and statistical modelling often struggle to effectively handle the intricacies of complex systems, particularly when dealing with multi-variate signals. In contrast, neural network-based anomaly detection methods, especially Auto-Encoders, have emerged as a compelling alternative, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, Auto-Encoders exhibit inherent opaqueness in their decision-making processes, hindering their practical implementation at scale. Addressing this opacity is essential for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of anomaly detection models. In this work, we address this challenge by employing a feature selector to select features and counterfactual explanations to give a context to the model output. We tested this approach on the SKAB benchmark dataset and an industrial time-series dataset. The gradient based counterfactual explanation approach was evaluated via validity, sparsity and distance measures. Our experimental findings illustrate that our proposed counterfactual approach can offer meaningful and valuable insights into the model decision-making process, by explaining fewer signals compared to conventional approaches. These insights enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of anomaly detection models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, conference proceeding</p></details> | None |

However, the complexity of the image background and various anomaly patterns pose new challenges to existing matrix decomposition methods, which are inadequate for modeling requirements. Moreover, the uncertainty of the anomaly can cause anomaly contamination problems, making the designed model and method highly susceptible to external disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage strategy anomaly detection method that detects anomalies by identifying suspected patches (Ano-SuPs). Specifically, we propose to detect the patches with anomalies by reconstructing the input image twice: the first step is to obtain a set of normal patches by removing those suspected patches, and the second step is to use those normal patches to refine the identification of the patches with anomalies. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate the proposed method systematically through simulation experiments and case studies. We further identified the key parameters and designed steps that impact the model's performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted oral presentation at the 18th INFORMS DMDA Workshop</p></details> | None |

The partial diffusion strategy, which depends on the diffusion steps, is commonly used for anomaly detection in these models. However, different diffusion steps have an impact on the reconstruction of the original data, thereby impacting the effectiveness of anomaly detection. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named DiffGAN, which adds a generative adversarial network component to the denoiser of diffusion model. This addition allows for the simultaneous generation of noisy data and prediction of diffusion steps. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction models, experimental results demonstrate that DiffGAN achieves superior performance in anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

Among other statistical models used to represent joint distribution, Markov random fields (MRF) can be used to efficiently represent statistical dependencies between variables. As the number of terms in the partition function scales exponentially with the number of variables, the potential of each configuration cannot be computed exactly in a reasonable time for large instances. In this paper, we aim to take advantage of the exponential scalability of quantum computing to speed up the estimation of the partition function of a MRF representing the dependencies between operating variables of an airborne radar. For that purpose, we implement a quantum algorithm for partition function estimation in the one clean qubit model. After proposing suitable formulations, we discuss the performances and scalability of our approach in comparison to the theoretical performances of the algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, presented at the SEE Radar 2024 Conference</p></details> | None |
| **[InDeed: Interpretable image deep decomposition with guaranteed generalizability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01127v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image decomposition aims to analyze an image into elementary components, which is essential for numerous downstream tasks and also by nature provides certain interpretability to the analysis. Deep learning can be powerful for such tasks, but surprisingly their combination with a focus on interpretability and generalizability is rarely explored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for interpretable deep image decomposition, combining hierarchical Bayesian modeling and deep learning to create an architecture-modularized and model-generalizable deep neural network (DNN). The proposed framework includes three steps: (1) hierarchical Bayesian modeling of image decomposition, (2) transforming the inference problem into optimization tasks, and (3) deep inference via a modularized Bayesian DNN. We further establish a theoretical connection between the loss function and the generalization error bound, which inspires a new test-time adaptation approach for out-of-distribution scenarios. We instantiated the application using two downstream tasks, \textit{i.e.}, image denoising, and unsupervised anomaly detection, and the results demonstrated improved generalizability as well as interpretability of our methods. The source code will be released upon the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Efficient Outlier Detection Algorithm for Data Streaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01061v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nature of modern data is increasingly real-time, making outlier detection crucial in any data-related field, such as finance for fraud detection and healthcare for monitoring patient vitals. Traditional outlier detection methods, such as the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm, struggle with real-time data due to the need for extensive recalculations with each new data point, limiting their application in real-time environments. While the Incremental LOF (ILOF) algorithm has been developed to tackle the challenges of online anomaly detection, it remains computationally expensive when processing large streams of data points, and its detection performance may degrade after a certain threshold of points have streamed in. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of LOF algorithms for online anomaly detection, named the Efficient Incremental LOF (EILOF) algorithm. The EILOF algorithm only computes the LOF scores of new points without altering the LOF scores of existing data points. Although exact LOF scores have not yet been computed for the existing points in the new algorithm, datasets often contain noise, and minor deviations in LOF score calculations do not necessarily degrade detection performance. In fact, such deviations can sometimes enhance outlier detection. We systematically tested this approach on both simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that EILOF outperforms ILOF as the volume of streaming data increases across various scenarios. The EILOF algorithm not only significantly reduces computational costs, but also systematically improves detection accuracy when the number of additional points increases compared to the ILOF algorithm.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures | None |

While overt attacks that force vehicles to collide may be easily identified, more insidious attacks, which only slightly alter driving behavior, can result in network-wide increases in congestion, fuel consumption, and even crash risk without being easily detected. To address the detection of such attacks, we first present a traffic model framework for three types of potential cyberattacks: malicious manipulation of vehicle control commands, false data injection attacks on sensor measurements, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We then investigate the impacts of these attacks at both the individual vehicle (micro) and traffic flow (macro) levels. A novel generative adversarial network (GAN)-based anomaly detection model is proposed for real-time identification of such attacks using vehicle trajectory data. We provide numerical evidence {to demonstrate} the efficacy of our machine learning approach in detecting cyberattacks on ACC-equipped vehicles. The proposed method is compared against some recently proposed neural network models and observed to have higher accuracy in identifying anomalous driving behaviors of ACC vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

Drawing inspiration from the widespread success of large language models, we consider the simple strategy of discretely tokenizing time series data drawn from a myriad of datasets via self-supervision, then using the fixed tokenization to solve a variety of tasks across many data domains. Canonically, time series models are either trained on a single dataset or built in a task-specific manner (e.g., a forecasting-only model), where many use patches of time as inputs to the model. As such, performant generalist, discrete representation time series models explored across many tasks are of value. Our method, TOkenized Time Series EMbeddings (TOTEM), produces such generalist time series models with minimal or no fine-tuning while exhibiting strong zero-shot performance. We evaluate TOTEM extensively over nearly 500 experiments on three commonly-studied time series tasks with real-world data: imputation (17 baselines, 12 datasets), anomaly detection (19 baselines, 25 datasets), and forecasting (14 baselines, 12 datasets). We conclude that TOTEM matches or outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both the canonical specialist setting (i.e., training one model on one domain) as well as the generalist setting (i.e., training a single model on many domains), which demonstrates the efficacy of tokenization for general time series analysis.

| **[A Classifier-Based Approach to Multi-Class Anomaly Detection for Astronomical Transients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14742v2)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating real-time anomaly detection is essential for identifying rare transients, with modern survey telescopes generating tens of thousands of alerts per night, and future telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, projected to increase this number dramatically. Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for astronomical transients rely either on hand-crafted features extracted from light curves or on features generated through unsupervised representation learning, coupled with standard anomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach: using the penultimate layer of a neural network classifier as the latent space for anomaly detection. We then propose a novel method, Multi-Class Isolation Forests (\texttt{MCIF}), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an anomaly score for a light curve from its latent space representation. This approach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest. We also use a simpler input method for real-time transient classifiers which circumvents the need for interpolation and helps the neural network handle irregular sampling and model inter-passband relationships. Our anomaly detection pipeline identifies rare classes including kilonovae, pair-instability supernovae, and intermediate luminosity transients shortly after trigger on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Using a sample of our simulations matching the population of anomalies expected in nature (54 anomalies and 12,040 common transients), our method discovered $41\pm3$ anomalies (~75% recall) after following up the top 2000 (~15%) ranked transients. Our novel method shows that classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables.

However, the decoder trained only on normal samples still reconstructs abnormal patch features well, degrading performance. This issue is particularly pronounced in unsupervised multi-class anomaly detection tasks. We attribute this behavior to over-generalization(OG) of decoder: the significantly increasing diversity of patch patterns in multi-class training enhances the model generalization on normal patches, but also inadvertently broadens its generalization to abnormal patches. To mitigate OG, we propose a novel approach that leverages class-agnostic learnable prompts to capture common textual normality across various visual patterns, and then apply them to guide the decoded features towards a normal textual representation, suppressing over-generalization of the decoder on abnormal patterns. To further improve performance, we also introduce a gated mixture-of-experts module to specialize in handling diverse patch patterns and reduce mutual interference between them in multi-class training. Our method achieves competitive performance on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Encoding logical qubits with superconducting qubits and surface codes is considered a promising candidate for FTQC architectures. In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture, which we call Q3DE, that enhances the tolerance to multi-bit burst errors (MBBEs) by cosmic rays with moderate changes and overhead. There are three core components in Q3DE: in-situ anomaly DEtection, dynamic code DEformation, and optimized error DEcoding. In this architecture, MBBEs are detected only from syndrome values for error correction. The effect of MBBEs is immediately mitigated by dynamically increasing the encoding level of logical qubits and re-estimating probable recovery operation with the rollback of the decoding process. We investigate the performance and overhead of the Q3DE architecture with quantum-error simulators and demonstrate that Q3DE effectively reduces the period of MBBEs by 1000 times and halves the size of their region. Therefore, Q3DE significantly relaxes the requirement of qubit density and qubit chip size to realize FTQC. Our scheme is versatile for mitigating MBBEs, i.e., temporal variations of error properties, on a wide range of physical devices and FTQC architectures since it relies only on the standard features of topological stabilizer codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2022 55th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)</p></details> | None |

To this end, some critical issues remain open: how to design advisable metric to measure anomalies, and how to properly generate training samples of anomaly data? Classical effort in anomaly detection usually resorts to pixel-wise uncertainty or sample synthesis, which ignores the contextual information and sometimes requires auxiliary data with fine-grained annotations. On the contrary, in this paper, we exploit the strong context-dependent nature of the segmentation task and design an energy-guided self-supervised framework for anomaly segmentation, which optimizes an anomaly head by maximizing the likelihood of self-generated anomaly pixels. For this purpose, we design two estimators to model anomaly likelihood, one is a task-agnostic binary estimator and the other depicts the likelihood as residual of task-oriented joint energy. Based on the proposed estimators, we devise an adaptive self-supervised training framework, which exploits the contextual reliance and estimated likelihood to refine mask annotations in anomaly areas. We conduct extensive experiments on challenging Fishyscapes and Road Anomaly benchmarks, demonstrating that without any auxiliary data or synthetic models, our method can still achieve comparable performance to supervised competitors.

| **[An Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Electricity Consumption Using Reinforcement Learning and Time Series Forest Based Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00107v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) plays a crucial role in time series applications, primarily because time series data is employed across real-world scenarios. Detecting anomalies poses significant challenges since anomalies take diverse forms making them hard to pinpoint accurately. Previous research has explored different AD models, making specific assumptions with varying sensitivity toward particular anomaly types. To address this issue, we propose a novel model selection for unsupervised AD using a combination of time series forest (TSF) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that dynamically chooses an AD technique. Our approach allows for effective AD without explicitly depending on ground truth labels that are often scarce and expensive to obtain. Results from the real-time series dataset demonstrate that the proposed model selection approach outperforms all other AD models in terms of the F1 score metric. For the synthetic dataset, our proposed model surpasses all other AD models except for KNN, with an impressive F1 score of 0.989. The proposed model selection framework also exceeded the performance of GPT-4 when prompted to act as an anomaly detector on the synthetic dataset. Exploring different reward functions revealed that the original reward function in our proposed AD model selection approach yielded the best overall scores. We evaluated the performance of the six AD models on an additional three datasets, having global, local, and clustered anomalies respectively, showing that each AD model exhibited distinct performance depending on the type of anomalies. This emphasizes the significance of our proposed AD model selection framework, maintaining high performance across all datasets, and showcasing superior performance across different anomaly types.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Graph Mixture of Experts and Memory-augmented Routers for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19108v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is a critical task that involves identifying abnormal patterns or events in data that consist of multiple interrelated time series. In order to better model the complex interdependence between entities and the various inherent characteristics of each entity, the GNN based methods are widely adopted by existing methods. In each layer of GNN, node features aggregate information from their neighboring nodes to update their information. In doing so, from shallow layer to deep layer in GNN, original individual node features continue to be weakened and more structural information,i.e., from short-distance neighborhood to long-distance neighborhood, continues to be enhanced. However, research to date has largely ignored the understanding of how hierarchical graph information is represented and their characteristics that can benefit anomaly detection. Existing methods simply leverage the output from the last layer of GNN for anomaly estimation while neglecting the essential information contained in the intermediate GNN layers. To address such limitations, in this paper, we propose a Graph Mixture of Experts (Graph-MoE) network for multivariate time series anomaly detection, which incorporates the mixture of experts (MoE) module to adaptively represent and integrate hierarchical multi-layer graph information into entity representations. It is worth noting that our Graph-MoE can be integrated into any GNN-based MTS anomaly detection method in a plug-and-play manner. In addition, the memory-augmented routers are proposed in this paper to capture the correlation temporal information in terms of the global historical features of MTS to adaptively weigh the obtained entity representations to achieve successful anomaly estimation. Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets prove the superiority of our approach and each proposed module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

This study explores video anomaly detection within a Functional Data Analysis framework, focusing on the application of the Magnitude-Shape (MS) Plot. Autoencoders are used to learn and reconstruct normal behavioral patterns from anomaly-free training data, resulting in low reconstruction errors for normal frames and higher errors for frames with potential anomalies. The reconstruction error matrix for each frame is treated as multivariate functional data, with the MS-Plot applied to analyze both magnitude and shape deviations, enhancing the accuracy of anomaly detection. Using its capacity to evaluate the magnitude and shape of deviations, the MS-Plot offers a statistically principled and interpretable framework for anomaly detection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue, demonstrating promising performance. It performs better than traditional univariate functional detectors (e.g., FBPlot, TVDMSS, Extremal Depth, and Outliergram) and several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MS-Plot-based framework for effective anomaly detection in crowded video scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

Researchers have demonstrated that modern vehicles are susceptible to various types of attacks, enabling attackers to gain control and compromise safety-critical electronic systems. Consequently, several Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed in the literature to detect such cyber-attacks on vehicles. This paper introduces a novel generative classifier-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed for anomaly detection in automotive networks, specifically focusing on the Controller Area Network (CAN). Leveraging variational Bayes, our proposed IDS utilizes a deep latent variable model to construct a causal graph for conditional probabilities. An auto-encoder architecture is utilized to build the classifier to estimate conditional probabilities, which contribute to the final prediction probabilities through Bayesian inference. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art IDSs on a public Car-hacking dataset highlight our proposed classifier's superior performance in improving detection accuracy and F1-score. The proposed IDS demonstrates its efficacy by outperforming existing models with limited training data, providing enhanced security assurance for automotive systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TETC-CS (Under review)</p></details> | None |

However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Time Series Foundational Models: Their Role in Anomaly Detection and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19286v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundational models (TSFM) have gained prominence in time series forecasting, promising state-of-the-art performance across various applications. However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored, with growing concerns regarding their black-box nature, lack of interpretability and applicability. This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of TSFM in anomaly detection and prediction tasks. We systematically analyze TSFM across multiple datasets, including those characterized by the absence of discernible patterns, trends and seasonality. Our analysis shows that while TSFMs can be extended for anomaly detection and prediction, traditional statistical and deep learning models often match or outperform TSFM in these tasks. Additionally, TSFMs require high computational resources but fail to capture sequential dependencies effectively or improve performance in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. \noindent The preprocessed datasets, codes to reproduce the results and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/smtmnfg/TSFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

| **[A Comprehensive Augmentation Framework for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15068v5)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation methods are commonly integrated into the training of anomaly detection models. Previous approaches have primarily focused on replicating real-world anomalies or enhancing diversity, without considering that the standard of anomaly varies across different classes, potentially leading to a biased training distribution. This paper analyzes crucial traits of simulated anomalies that contribute to the training of reconstructive networks and condenses them into several methods, thus creating a comprehensive framework by selectively utilizing appropriate combinations. Furthermore, we integrate this framework with a reconstruction-based approach and concurrently propose a split training strategy that alleviates the issue of overfitting while avoiding introducing interference to the reconstruction process. The evaluations conducted on the MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach, particularly in terms of object classes. To evaluate generalizability, we generate a simulated dataset comprising anomalies with diverse characteristics since the original test samples only include specific types of anomalies and may lead to biased evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits promising potential for generalizing effectively to various unforeseen anomalies encountered in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
