| **[Unleashing HyDRa: Hybrid Fusion, Depth Consistency and Radar for Unified 3D Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07746v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-cost, vision-centric 3D perception systems for autonomous driving have made significant progress in recent years, narrowing the gap to expensive LiDAR-based methods. The primary challenge in becoming a fully reliable alternative lies in robust depth prediction capabilities, as camera-based systems struggle with long detection ranges and adverse lighting and weather conditions. In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion architecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of dense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid fusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar features in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association Transformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to produce more robust and accurate depth predictions. In the BEV, we refine the initial sparse representation by a Radar-weighted Depth Consistency. HyDRa achieves a new state-of-the-art for camera-radar fusion of 64.2 NDS (+1.8) and 58.4 AMOTA (+1.5) on the public nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our new semantically rich and spatially accurate BEV features can be directly converted into a powerful occupancy representation, beating all previous camera-based methods on the Occ3D benchmark by an impressive 3.7 mIoU.

| **[CoSDH: Communication-Efficient Collaborative Perception via Supply-Demand Awareness and Intermediate-Late Hybridization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03430v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent collaborative perception enhances perceptual capabilities by utilizing information from multiple agents and is considered a fundamental solution to the problem of weak single-vehicle perception in autonomous driving. However, existing collaborative perception methods face a dilemma between communication efficiency and perception accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on supply-demand awareness and intermediate-late hybridization, dubbed as \mymethodname. By modeling the supply-demand relationship between agents, the framework refines the selection of collaboration regions, reducing unnecessary communication cost while maintaining accuracy. In addition, we innovatively introduce the intermediate-late hybrid collaboration mode, where late-stage collaboration compensates for the performance degradation in collaborative perception under low communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, including both simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that \mymethodname~ achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy and optimal bandwidth trade-offs, delivering superior detection precision under real communication bandwidths, thus proving its effectiveness and practical applicability.

| **[SLTNet: Efficient Event-based Semantic Segmentation with Spike-driven Lightweight Transformer-based Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12843v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based semantic segmentation has great potential in autonomous driving and robotics due to the advantages of event cameras, such as high dynamic range, low latency, and low power cost. Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed.

| **[Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: Progress, Limitations, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03262v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods and devises a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms discussed in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  | None |

Although DiT with 3D VAE has become a standard framework for video generation, it introduces challenges in controllable driving video generation, especially for geometry control, rendering existing control methods ineffective. To address these issues, we propose MagicDrive-V2, a novel approach that integrates the MVDiT block and spatial-temporal conditional encoding to enable multi-view video generation and precise geometric control. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for obtaining contextual descriptions for videos to support diverse textual control, along with a progressive training strategy using mixed video data to enhance training efficiency and generalizability. Consequently, MagicDrive-V2 enables multi-view driving video synthesis with $3.3\times$ resolution and $4\times$ frame count (compared to current SOTA), rich contextual control, and geometric controls. Extensive experiments demonstrate MagicDrive-V2's ability, unlocking broader applications in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://flymin.github.io/magicdrive-v2/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://flymin.github.io/magicdrive-v2) |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |
| **[RoboSense: Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Egocentric Robot Perception and Navigation in Crowded and Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15503v5)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable embodied perception from an egocentric perspective is challenging yet essential for autonomous navigation technology of intelligent mobile agents. With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future research development, where the detailed analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly. Data desensitization measures have been conducted for privacy protection.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 | None |
| **[Don't Shake the Wheel: Momentum-Aware Planning in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03125v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving frameworks enable seamless integration of perception and planning but often rely on one-shot trajectory prediction, which may lead to unstable control and vulnerability to occlusions in single-frame perception. To address this, we propose the Momentum-Aware Driving (MomAD) framework, which introduces trajectory momentum and perception momentum to stabilize and refine trajectory predictions. MomAD comprises two core components: (1) Topological Trajectory Matching (TTM) employs Hausdorff Distance to select the optimal planning query that aligns with prior paths to ensure coherence;(2) Momentum Planning Interactor (MPI) cross-attends the selected planning query with historical queries to expand static and dynamic perception files. This enriched query, in turn, helps regenerate long-horizon trajectory and reduce collision risks. To mitigate noise arising from dynamic environments and detection errors, we introduce robust instance denoising during training, enabling the planning model to focus on critical signals and improve its robustness. We also propose a novel Trajectory Prediction Consistency (TPC) metric to quantitatively assess planning stability. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MomAD achieves superior long-term consistency (>=3s) compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, evaluations on the curated Turning-nuScenes shows that MomAD reduces the collision rate by 26% and improves TPC by 0.97m (33.45%) over a 6s prediction horizon, while closedloop on Bench2Drive demonstrates an up to 16.3% improvement in success rate.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Car-STAGE: Automated framework for large-scale high-dimensional simulated time-series data generation based on user-defined criteria](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03100v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating large-scale sensing datasets through photo-realistic simulation is an important aspect of many robotics applications such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we consider the problem of synchronous data collection from the open-source CARLA simulator using multiple sensors attached to vehicle based on user-defined criteria. We propose a novel, one-step framework that we refer to as Car-STAGE, based on CARLA simulator, to generate data using a graphical user interface (GUI) defining configuration parameters to data collection without any user intervention. This framework can utilize the user-defined configuration parameters such as choice of maps, number and configurations of sensors, environmental and lighting conditions etc. to run the simulation in the background, collecting high-dimensional sensor data from diverse sensors such as RGB Camera, LiDAR, Radar, Depth Camera, IMU Sensor, GNSS Sensor, Semantic Segmentation Camera, Instance Segmentation Camera, and Optical Flow Camera along with the ground-truths of the individual actors and storing the sensor data as well as ground-truth labels in a local or cloud-based database. The framework uses multiple threads where a main thread runs the server, a worker thread deals with queue and frame number and the rest of the threads processes the sensor data. The other way we derive speed up over the native implementation is by memory mapping the raw binary data into the disk and then converting the data into known formats at the end of data collection. We show that using these techniques, we gain a significant speed up over frames, under an increasing set of sensors and over the number of spawned objects.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Perceptual Motor Learning with Active Inference Framework for Robust Lateral Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01676v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel Perceptual Motor Learning (PML) framework integrated with Active Inference (AIF) to enhance lateral control in Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs). PML, inspired by human motor learning, emphasizes the seamless integration of perception and action, enabling efficient decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional autonomous driving approaches--including modular pipelines, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning--struggle with adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize prediction error ("surprise") and actively shape vehicle control based on learned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning with active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping maneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different environments. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that PML with AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while achieving performance comparable to conventional methods. These findings highlight the potential of PML-driven active inference as a robust alternative for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IROS 2025 and is currently under review. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.07684</p></details> | None |
| **[BEVDriver: Leveraging BEV Maps in LLMs for Robust Closed-Loop Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03074v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving has the potential to set the stage for more efficient future mobility, requiring the research domain to establish trust through safe, reliable and transparent driving. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess reasoning capabilities and natural language understanding, presenting the potential to serve as generalized decision-makers for ego-motion planning that can interact with humans and navigate environments designed for human drivers. While this research avenue is promising, current autonomous driving approaches are challenged by combining 3D spatial grounding and the reasoning and language capabilities of LLMs. We introduce BEVDriver, an LLM-based model for end-to-end closed-loop driving in CARLA that utilizes latent BEV features as perception input. BEVDriver includes a BEV encoder to efficiently process multi-view images and 3D LiDAR point clouds. Within a common latent space, the BEV features are propagated through a Q-Former to align with natural language instructions and passed to the LLM that predicts and plans precise future trajectories while considering navigation instructions and critical scenarios. On the LangAuto benchmark, our model reaches up to 18.9% higher performance on the Driving Score compared to SoTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17648v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> | None |
| **[Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Feedforward Control in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02693v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feedforward control (FF) is often combined with feedback control (FB) in many control systems, improving tracking performance, efficiency, and stability. However, designing effective data-driven FF controllers in multi-agent systems requires significant data collection, including transferring private or proprietary data, which raises privacy concerns and incurs high communication costs. Therefore, we propose a novel approach integrating Federated Learning (FL) into FF control to address these challenges. This approach enables privacy-preserving, communication-efficient, and decentralized continuous improvement of FF controllers across multiple agents without sharing personal or proprietary data. By leveraging FL, each agent learns a local, neural FF controller using its data and contributes only model updates to a global aggregation process, ensuring data privacy and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an autonomous driving use case. Therein, vehicles equipped with a trajectory-tracking feedback controller are enhanced by FL-based neural FF control. Simulations highlight significant improvements in tracking performance compared to pure FB control, analogous to model-based FF control. We achieve comparable tracking performance without exchanging private vehicle-specific data compared to a centralized neural FF control. Our results underscore the potential of FL-based neural FF control to enable privacy-preserving learning in multi-agent control systems, paving the way for scalable and efficient autonomous systems applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite the outstanding performance of CV systems in specific domains, their development and exploitation at industrial-scale necessitates, among other, the addressing of requirements related to the reliability, transparency, trustworthiness, security, safety, and robustness of the developed AI models. The latter raises the imperative need for the development of efficient, comprehensive and widely-adopted industrial standards. In this context, this study investigates the current state of play regarding the development of industrial computer vision AI standards, emphasizing on critical aspects, like model interpretability, data quality, and regulatory compliance. In particular, a systematic analysis of launched and currently developing CV standards, proposed by the main international standardization bodies (e.g. ISO/IEC, IEEE, DIN, etc.) is performed. The latter is complemented by a comprehensive discussion on the current challenges and future directions observed in this regularization endeavor.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Human-aligned Safe Reinforcement Learning for Highway On-Ramp Merging in Dense Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02624v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for the decision-making of autonomous driving consider safety as a reward instead of a cost, which makes it hard to balance the tradeoff between safety and other objectives. Human risk preference has also rarely been incorporated, and the trained policy might be either conservative or aggressive for users. To this end, this study proposes a human-aligned safe RL approach for autonomous merging, in which the high-level decision problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) that incorporates users' risk preference into the safety constraints, followed by a model predictive control (MPC)-based low-level control. The safety level of RL policy can be adjusted by computing cost limits of CMDP's constraints based on risk preferences and traffic density using a fuzzy control method. To filter out unsafe or invalid actions, we design an action shielding mechanism that pre-executes RL actions using an MPC method and performs collision checks with surrounding agents. We also provide theoretical proof to validate the effectiveness of the shielding mechanism in enhancing RL's safety and sample efficiency. Simulation experiments in multiple levels of traffic densities show that our method can significantly reduce safety violations without sacrificing traffic efficiency. Furthermore, due to the use of risk preference-aware constraints in CMDP and action shielding, we can not only adjust the safety level of the final policy but also reduce safety violations during the training stage, proving a promising solution for online learning in real-world environments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures | None |

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PlanScope: Learning to Plan Within Decision Scope Does Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00476v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of autonomous driving, learning-based methods have been promising for the development of planning modules. During the training process of planning modules, directly minimizing the discrepancy between expert-driving logs and planning output is widely deployed. In general, driving logs consist of suddenly appearing obstacles or swiftly changing traffic signals, which typically necessitate swift and nuanced adjustments in driving maneuvers. Concurrently, future trajectories of the vehicles exhibit their long-term decisions, such as adhering to a reference lane or circumventing stationary obstacles. Due to the unpredictable influence of future events in driving logs, reasoning bias could be naturally introduced to learning based planning modules, which leads to a possible degradation of driving performance. To address this issue, we identify the decisions and their corresponding time horizons, and characterize a so-called decision scope by retaining decisions within derivable horizons only, to mitigate the effect of irrational behaviors caused by unpredictable events. Several viable implementations have been proposed, among which batch normalization along the temporal dimension is particularly effective and achieves superior performance. It consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of driving scores, as demonstrated through closed-loop evaluations on the nuPlan dataset. Essentially, this approach accommodates an appealing plug-and-play feature to enhance the closed-loop performance of other learning-based planning models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, models trained solely on single-task objectives or generic datasets often lack the contextual information needed for robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified encoder trained on multiple computer vision tasks crucial for urban driving, including depth, pose, and 3D scene flow estimation, as well as semantic, instance, panoptic, and motion segmentation. By integrating these diverse visual cues-similar to human perceptual mechanisms-the encoder captures rich features that enhance navigation-related predictions. We evaluate the model on steering estimation as a downstream task, leveraging its dense latent space. To ensure efficient multi-task learning, we introduce a multi-scale feature network for pose estimation and apply knowledge distillation from a multi-backbone teacher model. Our findings highlight two key findings: (1) the unified encoder achieves competitive performance across all visual perception tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities; and (2) for steering estimation, the frozen unified encoder-leveraging dense latent representations-outperforms both its fine-tuned counterpart and the same frozen model pretrained on generic datasets like ImageNet. These results underline the significance of task-specific visual features and demonstrate the promise of multi-task learning in advancing autonomous driving systems.

To address the high computational costs of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, this paper introduces TwinLiteNetPlus (TwinLiteNet$^+$), a model adept at balancing efficiency and accuracy. TwinLiteNet$^+$ incorporates standard and depth-wise separable dilated convolutions, reducing complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It is available in four configurations, from the robust 1.94 million-parameter TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Large}}$ to the ultra-compact 34K-parameter TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Nano}}$. Notably, TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Large}}$ attains a 92.9\% mIoU for Drivable Area Segmentation and a 34.2\% IoU for Lane Segmentation. These results notably outperform those of current SOTA models while requiring a computational cost that is approximately 11 times lower in terms of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) compared to the existing SOTA model. Extensively tested on various embedded devices, TwinLiteNet$^+$ demonstrates promising latency and power efficiency, underscoring its suitability for real-world autonomous vehicle applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Cross-view pose optimization offers an effective solution by directly estimating vehicle pose using satellite-view images. However, existing methods primarily rely on cross-view features at a given pose, neglecting fine-grained contexts for precision and global contexts for robustness against large initial pose errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose PIDLoc, a novel cross-view pose optimization approach inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Using RGB images and LiDAR, the PIDLoc comprises the PID branches to model cross-view feature relationships and the spatially aware pose estimator (SPE) to estimate the pose from these relationships. The PID branches leverage feature differences for local context (P), aggregated feature differences for global context (I), and gradients of feature differences for precise pose adjustment (D) to enhance localization accuracy under large initial pose errors. Integrated with the PID branches, the SPE captures spatial relationships within the PID-branch features for consistent localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIDLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-view pose estimation for the KITTI dataset, reducing position error by $37.8\%$ compared with the previous state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR-25 | None |

The creation of segmented scenarios within a simulated environment is acknowledged as a robust and effective strategy; however, the process of tailoring these scenarios often necessitates laborious and time-consuming manual efforts, thereby hindering the development and implementation of AD technologies. In response to this challenge, we introduce Text2Scenario, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to autonomously generate simulation test scenarios that closely align with user specifications, derived from their natural language inputs. Specifically, an LLM, equipped with a meticulously engineered input prompt scheme functions as a text parser for test scenario descriptions, extracting from a hierarchically organized scenario repository the components that most accurately reflect the user's preferences. Subsequently, by exploiting the precedence of scenario components, the process involves sequentially matching and linking scenario representations within a Domain Specific Language corpus, ultimately fabricating executable test scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that such prompt engineering can meticulously extract the nuanced details of scenario elements embedded within various descriptive formats, with the majority of generated scenarios aligning closely with the user's initial expectations, allowing for the efficient and precise evaluation of diverse AD stacks void of the labor-intensive need for manual scenario configuration.

However, despite the perception stability in harsh environments, the point cloud generated by mmWave radar is relatively sparse while containing significant noise, which limits its further development. Traditional mmWave radar enhancement approaches often struggle to leverage the effectiveness of diffusion models in super-resolution, largely due to the unnatural range-azimuth heatmap (RAH) or bird's eye view (BEV) representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that pioneers the application of fusing range images with image diffusion models, achieving accurate and dense mmWave radar point clouds that are similar to LiDAR. Benefitting from the projection that aligns with human observation, the range image representation of mmWave radar is close to natural images, allowing the knowledge from pre-trained image diffusion models to be effectively transferred, significantly improving the overall performance. Extensive evaluations on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets demonstrate that our approach provides substantial improvements, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in generating truly three-dimensional LiDAR-like point clouds via mmWave radar.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to 2025 IROS.

Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been explored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout choice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on multi-channel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this limitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed specifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments. ECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation Model (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring both robust generalizability and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional adaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank adaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the nested Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer layer of the underlying FM is treated as a separate expert, with embeddings extracted from these experts fused using trainable weights within a gating mechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local ECG features, leading to a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 7% increase in the F1 score, all while maintaining computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG-EmotionNet architecture is evaluated using a recently introduced and challenging driver emotion monitoring dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

CAPS addresses the challenge of imbalanced training datasets in imitation learning by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). The use of VQ-VAE provides a structured and interpretable data representation, which helps reveal meaningful patterns in the data. These patterns are used to group the data into clusters, with each sample being assigned a cluster ID. The cluster IDs are then used to re-balance the dataset, ensuring that rare yet valuable samples receive higher priority during training. By ensuring a more diverse and informative training set, CAPS improves the generalization of the trained planner across a wide range of driving scenarios. We evaluate our method through closed-loop simulations in the CARLA environment. The results on Bench2Drive scenarios demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, leading to notable improvements in model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing path planning methodologies fall short of addressing this need due to their incapability to handle the diverse and complex parking scenarios in reality. While non-learning methods provide reliable planning results, they are vulnerable to intricate occasions, whereas learning-based ones are good at exploration but unstable in converging to feasible solutions. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we introduce Hybrid pOlicy Path plannEr (HOPE). This novel solution integrates a reinforcement learning agent with Reeds-Shepp curves, enabling effective planning across diverse scenarios. HOPE guides the exploration of the reinforcement learning agent by applying an action mask mechanism and employs a transformer to integrate the perceived environmental information with the mask. To facilitate the training and evaluation of the proposed planner, we propose a criterion for categorizing the difficulty level of parking scenarios based on space and obstacle distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms typical rule-based algorithms and traditional reinforcement learning methods, showing higher planning success rates and generalization across various scenarios. We also conduct real-world experiments to verify the practicability of HOPE.

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC) |
| **[GDTS: Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14922v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception.

Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, which necessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the high computational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered the seamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost of our approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%.

Despite its popularity, the limitations of infrared cameras, such as low spatial resolution and complex degradations, consistently challenge imaging quality and subsequent visual tasks. Hence, infrared image super-resolution (IISR) has been developed to address this challenge. While recent developments in diffusion models have greatly advanced this field, current methods to solve it either ignore the unique modal characteristics of infrared imaging or overlook the machine perception requirements. To bridge these gaps, we propose DifIISR, an infrared image super-resolution diffusion model optimized for visual quality and perceptual performance. Our approach achieves task-based guidance for diffusion by injecting gradients derived from visual and perceptual priors into the noise during the reverse process. Specifically, we introduce an infrared thermal spectrum distribution regulation to preserve visual fidelity, ensuring that the reconstructed infrared images closely align with high-resolution images by matching their frequency components. Subsequently, we incorporate various visual foundational models as the perceptual guidance for downstream visual tasks, infusing generalizable perceptual features beneficial for detection and segmentation. As a result, our approach gains superior visual results while attaining State-Of-The-Art downstream task performance.

While Federated Learning (FL) could improve the generalization of an AD model (known as FedAD system), conventional models often struggle with under-fitting as the amount of accumulated training data progressively increases. To address this issue, instead of conventional small models, employing Large Vision Models (LVMs) in FedAD is a viable option for better learning of representations from a vast volume of data. However, implementing LVMs in FedAD introduces three challenges: (I) the extremely high communication overheads associated with transmitting LVMs between participating vehicles and a central server; (II) lack of computing resource to deploy LVMs on each vehicle; (III) the performance drop due to LVM focusing on shared features but overlooking local vehicle characteristics. To overcome these challenges, we propose pFedLVM, a LVM-Driven, Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning framework. In this approach, the LVM is deployed only on central server, which effectively alleviates the computational burden on individual vehicles. Furthermore, the exchange between central server and vehicles are the learned features rather than the LVM parameters, which significantly reduces communication overhead. In addition, we utilize both shared features from all participating vehicles and individual characteristics from each vehicle to establish a personalized learning mechanism. This enables each vehicle's model to learn features from others while preserving its personalized characteristics, thereby outperforming globally shared models trained in general FL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that pFedLVM outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to CVPR 2024 in Nov. 2023</p></details> | None |

In this study, we present S-NeRF++, an innovative autonomous driving simulation system based on neural reconstruction. Trained on widely-used self-driving datasets such as nuScenes and Waymo, S-NeRF++ can generate a large number of realistic street scenes and foreground objects with high rendering quality as well as offering considerable flexibility in manipulation and simulation. Specifically, S-NeRF++ is an enhanced neural radiance field for synthesizing large-scale scenes and moving vehicles, with improved scene parameterization and camera pose learning. The system effectively utilizes noisy and sparse LiDAR data to refine training and address depth outliers, ensuring high-quality reconstruction and novel-view rendering. It also provides a diverse foreground asset bank by reconstructing and generating different foreground vehicles to support comprehensive scenario creation.Moreover, we have developed an advanced foreground-background fusion pipeline that skillfully integrates illumination and shadow effects, further enhancing the realism of our simulations. With the high-quality simulated data provided by our S-NeRF++, we found the perception methods enjoy performance boosts on several autonomous driving downstream tasks, further demonstrating our proposed simulator's effectiveness.</p></details> | IEEE TPAMI 2025 | None |

Traditionally, road boundary detection in autonomous driving relies on cameras and LiDAR. However, they are vulnerable to poor lighting conditions, such as nighttime and direct sunlight glare, or prohibitively expensive for low-end vehicles. To this end, this paper introduces 4DRadarRBD, the first road boundary detection method based on 4D mmWave radar which is cost-effective and robust in complex driving scenarios. The main idea is that road boundaries (e.g., fences, bushes, roadblocks), reflect millimeter waves, thus generating point cloud data for the radar. To overcome the challenge that the 4D mmWave radar point clouds contain many noisy points, we initially reduce noisy points via physical constraints for road boundaries and then segment the road boundary points from the noisy points by incorporating a distance-based loss which penalizes for falsely detecting the points far away from the actual road boundaries. In addition, we capture the temporal dynamics of point cloud sequences by utilizing each point's deviation from the vehicle motion-compensated road boundary detection result obtained from the previous frame, along with the spatial distribution of the point cloud for point-wise road boundary segmentation. We evaluated 4DRadarRBD through real-world driving tests and achieved a road boundary point segmentation accuracy of 93$\%$, with a median distance error of up to 0.023 m and an error reduction of 92.6$\%$ compared to the baseline model.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the increased connectivity and massive data exchange for ML applications introduce significant privacy challenges. Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) offers potential solutions to address these challenges by preserving privacy at various stages of the ML pipeline. Despite the rapid development of ML-based IoV applications and the growing data privacy concerns, there are limited comprehensive studies on the adoption of PPML within this domain. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive review of the fundamentals, recent advancements, and the challenges of integrating PPML into IoV applications. To conduct an extensive study, we first review existing surveys of various PPML techniques and their integration into IoV across different scopes. We then discuss the fundamentals of IoV and propose a four-layer IoV architecture. Additionally, we categorize IoV applications into three key domains and analyze the privacy challenges in leveraging ML for these application domains. Next, we provide an overview of various PPML techniques, highlighting their applicability and performance to address the privacy challenges. Building on these fundamentals, we thoroughly review recent advancements in integrating various PPML techniques within IoV applications, discussing their frameworks, key features, and performance evaluation in terms of privacy, utility, and efficiency.

In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional map matching-based localization methods solve the poses by explicitly matching map elements with sensor observations, generally sensitive to perception noise, therefore requiring costly hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end localization neural network which directly estimates vehicle poses from surrounding images, without explicitly matching perception results with HD maps. To ensure efficiency and interpretability, a decoupled BEV neural matching-based pose solver is proposed, which estimates poses in a differentiable sampling-based matching module. Moreover, the sampling space is hugely reduced by decoupling the feature representation affected by each DoF of poses. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network is capable of performing decimeter level localization with mean absolute errors of 0.19m, 0.13m and 0.39 degree in longitudinal, lateral position and yaw angle while exhibiting a 68.8% reduction in inference memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

However, traditional approaches rely on either regressionbased models, which provide precise control but lack confidence estimation, or classification-based models, which offer confidence scores but suffer from reduced precision due to discretization. This limitation makes it challenging to quantify the reliability of predicted actions and apply corrections when necessary. In this work, we introduce a dual-head neural network architecture that integrates both regression and classification heads to improve decision reliability in imitation learning. The regression head predicts continuous driving actions, while the classification head estimates confidence, enabling a correction mechanism that adjusts actions in low-confidence scenarios, enhancing driving stability. We evaluate our approach in a closed-loop setting within the CARLA simulator, demonstrating its ability to detect uncertain actions, estimate confidence, and apply real-time corrections. Experimental results show that our method reduces lane deviation and improves trajectory accuracy by up to 50%, outperforming conventional regression-only models.

Leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of Visual Language Model (VLM), incorporating with diffusion Transformer-based action generation, our VDT-Auto parses the environment geometrically and contextually for the conditioning of the diffusion process. Geometrically, we use a bird's-eye view (BEV) encoder to extract feature grids from the surrounding images. Contextually, the structured output of our fine-tuned VLM is processed into textual embeddings and noisy paths. During our diffusion process, the added noise for the forward process is sampled from the noisy path output of the fine-tuned VLM, while the extracted BEV feature grids and embedded texts condition the reverse process of our diffusion Transformers. Our VDT-Auto achieved 0.52m on average L2 errors and 21% on average collision rate in the nuScenes open-loop planning evaluation. Moreover, the real-world demonstration exhibited prominent generalizability of our VDT-Auto. The code and dataset will be released after acceptance.</p></details> | Submitted paper | None |
| **[Actor-Critic Cooperative Compensation to Model Predictive Control for Off-Road Autonomous Vehicles Under Unknown Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00577v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents an Actor-Critic Cooperative Compensated Model Predictive Controller (AC3MPC) designed to address unknown system dynamics. To avoid the difficulty of modeling highly complex dynamics and ensuring realtime control feasibility and performance, this work uses deep reinforcement learning with a model predictive controller in a cooperative framework to handle unknown dynamics. The model-based controller takes on the primary role as both controllers are provided with predictive information about the other. This improves tracking performance and retention of inherent robustness of the model predictive controller. We evaluate this framework for off-road autonomous driving on unknown deformable terrains that represent sandy deformable soil, sandy and rocky soil, and cohesive clay-like deformable soil. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers by upto 29.2% and 10.2%. This framework generalized well over varied and previously unseen terrain characteristics to track longitudinal reference speeds with lower errors. Furthermore, this required significantly less training data compared to purely learning-based controller, while delivering better performance even when under-trained.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted at 2025 IEEE ICRA</p></details> | None |
| **[Navigation-Guided Sparse Scene Representation for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18341v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2EAD) methods typically rely on supervised perception tasks to extract explicit scene information (e.g., objects, maps). This reliance necessitates expensive annotations and constrains deployment and data scalability in real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce SSR, a novel framework that utilizes only 16 navigation-guided tokens as Sparse Scene Representation, efficiently extracting crucial scene information for E2EAD. Our method eliminates the need for human-designed supervised sub-tasks, allowing computational resources to concentrate on essential elements directly related to navigation intent. We further introduce a temporal enhancement module, aligning predicted future scenes with actual future scenes through self-supervision. SSR achieves a 27.2\% relative reduction in L2 error and a 51.6\% decrease in collision rate to UniAD in nuScenes, with a 10.9$\times$ faster inference speed and 13$\times$ faster training time. Moreover, SSR outperforms VAD-Base with a 48.6-point improvement on driving score in CARLA's Town05 Long benchmark. This framework represents a significant leap in real-time autonomous driving systems and paves the way for future scalable deployment.

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[3D StreetUnveiler with Semantic-aware 2DGS -- a simple baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18416v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unveiling an empty street from crowded observations captured by in-car cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporarily static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further applications.

| **[SafeAuto: Knowledge-Enhanced Safe Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00211v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional autonomous driving systems often struggle to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control, resulting in suboptimal and sometimes unsafe driving behaviors. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can process both visual and textual data, presents an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning tasks within a single framework. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a novel framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving systems by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce the Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss function, designed to improve the accuracy of low-level control signal predictions when numerical values are represented as text. Second, to ensure safe autonomous driving by explicitly integrating precise safety knowledge into the MLLM, we develop a reasoning component for SafeAuto. This component translates driving safety regulations into first-order logic rules (e.g., "red light => stop") and incorporates these rules into a probabilistic graphical model, such as a Markov Logic Network (MLN). The MLN is trained to verify the predicted next actions using environmental attributes identified by attribute recognition models (e.g., detecting a red light) to form the predicates. Additionally, we construct a Multimodal RAG model that leverages video data, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn more effectively from past similar driving experiences. By integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets. This advancement enables more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving systems that learn from experience, obey traffic laws, and perform precise control actions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual Thinking and Logical Processing -- Are Multi-modal Large Language Models Closing the Gap with Human Vision ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06967v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive, and slower logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However, their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential. This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stochasticity in Motion: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01628v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurate motion prediction is crucial for safe and efficient motion planning. To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, as models scale, their limited capacity becomes a significant challenge for adapting to novel scenarios. It is increasingly difficult to improve models for new situations using a single monolithic model. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of dynamically enhancing a basic driving planner with local driving data, without permanently modifying the planner itself. This approach, termed the Dynamically Local-Enhancement (DLE) Planner, aims to improve the scalability of autonomous driving systems without significantly expanding the planner's size. Our approach introduces a position-varying Markov Decision Process formulation coupled with a graph neural network that extracts region-specific driving features from local observation data. The learned features describe the local behavior of the surrounding objects, which is then leveraged to enhance a basic reinforcement learning-based policy. We evaluated our approach in multiple scenarios and compared it with a one-for-all driving model. The results show that our method outperforms the baseline policy in both safety (collision rate) and average reward, while maintaining a lighter scale. This approach has the potential to benefit large-scale autonomous vehicles without the need for largely expanding on-device driving models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AuthSim: Towards Authentic and Effective Safety-critical Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21100v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating adversarial safety-critical scenarios is a pivotal method for testing autonomous driving systems, as it identifies potential weaknesses and enhances system robustness and reliability. However, existing approaches predominantly emphasize unrestricted collision scenarios, prompting non-player character (NPC) vehicles to attack the ego vehicle indiscriminately. These works overlook these scenarios' authenticity, rationality, and relevance, resulting in numerous extreme, contrived, and largely unrealistic collision events involving aggressive NPC vehicles. To rectify this issue, we propose a three-layer relative safety region model, which partitions the area based on danger levels and increases the likelihood of NPC vehicles entering relative boundary regions. This model directs NPC vehicles to engage in adversarial actions within relatively safe boundary regions, thereby augmenting the scenarios' authenticity. We introduce AuthSim, a comprehensive platform for generating authentic and effective safety-critical scenarios by integrating the three-layer relative safety region model with reinforcement learning. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the authenticity and effectiveness of autonomous driving system test scenarios comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuthSim outperforms existing methods in generating effective safety-critical scenarios. Notably, AuthSim achieves a 5.25% improvement in average cut-in distance and a 27.12% enhancement in average collision interval time, while maintaining higher efficiency in generating effective safety-critical scenarios compared to existing methods. This underscores its significant advantage in producing authentic scenarios over current methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SegLocNet: Multimodal Localization Network for Autonomous Driving via Bird's-Eye-View Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20077v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization is critical for autonomous driving. Traditional GNSS-based localization methods suffer from signal occlusion and multipath effects in urban environments. Meanwhile, methods relying on high-definition (HD) maps are constrained by the high costs associated with the construction and maintenance of HD maps. Standard-definition (SD) maps-based methods, on the other hand, often exhibit unsatisfactory performance or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SegLocNet, a multimodal GNSS-free localization network that achieves precise localization using bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. SegLocNet employs a BEV segmentation network to generate semantic maps from multiple sensor inputs, followed by an exhaustive matching process to estimate the vehicle's ego pose. This approach avoids the limitations of regression-based pose estimation and maintains high interpretability and generalization. By introducing a unified map representation, our method can be applied to both HD and SD maps without any modifications to the network architecture, thereby balancing localization accuracy and area coverage. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and that our method can accurately estimate the ego pose in urban environments without relying on GNSS, while maintaining strong generalization ability. Our code and pre-trained model will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance.

This paper proposes a novel approach for just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) in autonomous driving software systems using multimodal learning. The proposed model leverages the multimodal transformers in which the pre-trained transformers and a combining module deal with the multiple data modalities of the software system datasets such as code features, change metrics, and contextual information. The key point for adapting multimodal learning is to utilize the attention mechanism between the different data modalities such as text, numerical, and categorical. In the combining module, the output of a transformer model on text data and tabular features containing categorical and numerical data are combined to produce the predictions using the fully connected layers. Experiments conducted on three open-source autonomous driving system software projects collected from the GitHub repository (Apollo, Carla, and Donkeycar) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models regarding evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning to enhance the reliability and safety of autonomous driving software through improved defect prediction.</p></details> | 9 | None |

This raises a crucial research question: how can we develop better scene feature representations to fully leverage sensor data in end-to-end driving? Self-supervised learning methods show great success in learning rich feature representations in NLP and computer vision. Inspired by this, we propose a novel self-supervised learning approach using the LAtent World model (LAW) for end-to-end driving. LAW predicts future scene features based on current features and ego trajectories. This self-supervised task can be seamlessly integrated into perception-free and perception-based frameworks, improving scene feature learning and optimizing trajectory prediction.

This is crucial for maintaining the reliability of open-world applications by identifying data distribution shifts, particularly in critical domains such as online transactions, autonomous driving, and real-time patient diagnosis. Despite the availability of numerous OOD detection methods, the challenge of selecting an optimal model for diverse tasks remains largely underexplored, especially in scenarios lacking ground truth labels. In this work, we introduce MetaOOD, the first zero-shot, unsupervised framework that utilizes meta-learning to select an OOD detection model automatically. As a meta-learning approach, MetaOOD leverages historical performance data of existing methods across various benchmark OOD detection datasets, enabling the effective selection of a suitable model for new datasets without the need for labeled data at the test time. To quantify task similarities more accurately, we introduce language model-based embeddings that capture the distinctive OOD characteristics of both datasets and detection models. Through extensive experimentation with 24 unique test dataset pairs to choose from among 11 OOD detection models, we demonstrate that MetaOOD significantly outperforms existing methods and only brings marginal time overhead. Our results, validated by Wilcoxon statistical tests, show that MetaOOD surpasses a diverse group of 11 baselines, including established OOD detectors and advanced unsupervised selection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best paper at 2024 KDD Workshop on Resource-Efficient Learning.

However, current benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate these claims, focusing only on general video quality, ignoring important factors to world models such as physics adherence. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldModelBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the world modeling capabilities of video generation models in application-driven domains. WorldModelBench offers two key advantages: (1) Against to nuanced world modeling violations: By incorporating instruction-following and physics-adherence dimensions, WorldModelBench detects subtle violations, such as irregular changes in object size that breach the mass conservation law - issues overlooked by prior benchmarks. (2) Aligned with large-scale human preferences: We crowd-source 67K human labels to accurately measure 14 frontier models. Using our high-quality human labels, we further fine-tune an accurate judger to automate the evaluation procedure, achieving 8.6% higher average accuracy in predicting world modeling violations than GPT-4o with 2B parameters. In addition, we demonstrate that training to align human annotations by maximizing the rewards from the judger noticeably improve the world modeling capability.

However, it requires laborious human efforts to annotate the point cloud for training a segmentation model. To address this challenge, we propose a YoCo framework, which generates 3D pseudo labels using minimal coarse click annotations in the bird's eye view plane. It is a significant challenge to produce high-quality pseudo labels from sparse annotations. Our YoCo framework first leverages vision foundation models combined with geometric constraints from point clouds to enhance pseudo label generation. Second, a temporal and spatial-based label updating module is designed to generate reliable updated labels. It leverages predictions from adjacent frames and utilizes the inherent density variation of point clouds (dense near, sparse far). Finally, to further improve label quality, an IoU-guided enhancement module is proposed, replacing pseudo labels with high-confidence and high-IoU predictions. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate YoCo's effectiveness and generality, achieving state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised methods and surpassing fully supervised Cylinder3D. Additionally, the YoCo is suitable for various networks, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised methods with minimal fine-tuning using only 0.8% of the fully labeled data, significantly reducing annotation costs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most of these methods rely on heavy encoder and decoder frameworks, hindering their performance in real-time scenarios. To explore real-time segmentation, recent advancements primarily focus on semantic segmentation within specific environments, such as autonomous driving. However, they often overlook the generalization ability of these models across diverse scenarios. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work explores a novel real-time segmentation setting called real-time multi-purpose segmentation. It contains three fundamental sub-tasks: interactive segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and video instance segmentation. Unlike previous methods, which use a specific design for each task, we aim to use only a single end-to-end model to accomplish all these tasks in real-time. To meet real-time requirements and balance multi-task learning, we present a novel dynamic convolution-based method, Real-Time Multi-Purpose SAM (RMP-SAM). It contains an efficient encoder and an efficient decoupled adapter to perform prompt-driven decoding. Moreover, we further explore different training strategies and one new adapter design to boost co-training performance further. We benchmark several strong baselines by extending existing works to support our multi-purpose segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMP-SAM is effective and generalizes well on proposed benchmarks and other specific semantic tasks.

Although sophisticated 3D object detection and tracking methods have been investigated and developed thoroughly in the fields of computer vision and autonomous driving, their demands on expensive and high-accuracy sensor setups and substantial computational resources from large neural networks make them unsuitable for indoor robotics. Recently, more lightweight perception algorithms leveraging onboard cameras or LiDAR sensors have emerged as promising alternatives. However, relying on a single sensor poses significant limitations: cameras have limited fields of view and can suffer from high noise, whereas LiDAR sensors operate at lower frequencies and lack the richness of visual features. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic obstacle detection and tracking framework that uses both onboard camera and LiDAR data to enable lightweight and accurate perception. Our proposed method expands on our previous ensemble detection approach, which integrates outputs from multiple low-accuracy but computationally efficient detectors to ensure real-time performance on the onboard computer. In this work, we propose a more robust fusion strategy that integrates both LiDAR and visual data to enhance detection accuracy further. We then utilize a tracking module that adopts feature-based object association and the Kalman filter to track and estimate detected obstacles' states. Besides, a dynamic obstacle classification algorithm is designed to robustly identify moving objects. The dataset evaluation demonstrates a better perception performance compared to benchmark methods. The physical experiments on a quadcopter robot confirms the feasibility for real-world navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, the availability of high-quality training can be limited for specialized tasks, such as high performance racing. Several recent works have leveraged AI-assistance to improve instruction of tasks ranging from rehabilitation to surgical robot tele-operation. However, these works often make simplifying assumptions on the student learning process, and fail to model how a teacher's assistance interacts with different individuals' abilities when determining optimal teaching strategies. Inspired by the idea of scaffolding from educational psychology, we leverage shared autonomy, a framework for combining user inputs with robot autonomy, to aid with curriculum design. Our key insight is that the way a student's behavior improves in the presence of assistance from an autonomous agent can highlight which sub-skills might be most ``learnable'' for the student, or within their Zone of Proximal Development. We use this to design Z-COACH, a method for using shared autonomy to provide personalized instruction targeting interpretable task sub-skills. In a user study (n=50), where we teach high performance racing in a simulated environment of the Thunderhill Raceway Park with the CARLA Autonomous Driving simulator, we show that Z-COACH helps identify which skills each student should first practice, leading to an overall improvement in driving time, behavior, and smoothness.

Traditional 3D tracking systems are typically constrained by predefined object categories, limiting their adaptability to novel, unseen objects in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we introduce open-vocabulary 3D tracking, which extends the scope of 3D tracking to include objects beyond predefined categories. We formulate the problem of open-vocabulary 3D tracking and introduce dataset splits designed to represent various open-vocabulary scenarios. We propose a novel approach that integrates open-vocabulary capabilities into a 3D tracking framework, allowing for generalization to unseen object classes. Our method effectively reduces the performance gap between tracking known and novel objects through strategic adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our method in diverse outdoor driving scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address open-vocabulary 3D tracking, presenting a significant advancement for autonomous systems in real-world settings.

However, depth ambiguity poses a significant challenge, as it requires extracting precise 3D scene geometry from a single image, resulting in suboptimal performance when transferring knowledge from a LiDAR-based teacher model to a camera-based student model. To address this issue, we introduce {\em Monocular Teaching Assistant Knowledge Distillation (MonoTAKD)} to enhance 3D perception in Mono3D. Our approach presents a robust camera-based teaching assistant model that effectively bridges the representation gap between different modalities for teacher and student models, addressing the challenge of inaccurate depth estimation. By defining 3D spatial cues as residual features that capture the differences between the teacher and the teaching assistant models, we leverage these cues into the student model, improving its 3D perception capabilities. Experimental results show that our MonoTAKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI3D dataset. Additionally, we evaluate the performance on nuScenes and KITTI raw datasets to demonstrate the generalization of our model to multi-view 3D and unsupervised data settings.

However, such representation necessitates cross-view overlap for accurate depth estimation, and is challenged by object occlusions and frustum truncations. As a result, these methods require scene-centric data acquisition to maintain cross-view overlap and complete scene visibility to circumvent occlusions and truncations, which limits their applicability to scene-centric reconstruction. In contrast, in autonomous driving scenarios, a more practical paradigm is ego-centric reconstruction, which is characterized by minimal cross-view overlap and frequent occlusions and truncations. The limitations of pixel-based representation thus hinder the utility of prior works in this task. In light of this, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of different representations, and introduces Omni-Gaussian representation with tailored network design to complement their strengths and mitigate their drawbacks. Experiments show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, pixelSplat and MVSplat, in ego-centric reconstruction, and achieves comparable performance to prior works in scene-centric reconstruction.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | None |

Among multiple advantages, CETC systems can distribute video processing tasks and enable adaptive analytics across cloud, edge, and terminal devices, leading to breakthroughs in video surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart cities. In this survey, we first analyze fundamental architectural components, including hierarchical, distributed, and hybrid frameworks, alongside edge computing platforms and resource management mechanisms. Building upon these foundations, edge-centric approaches emphasize on-device processing, edge-assisted offloading, and edge intelligence, while cloud-centric methods leverage powerful computational capabilities for complex video understanding and model training. Our investigation also covers hybrid video analytics incorporating adaptive task offloading and resource-aware scheduling techniques that optimize performance across the entire system. Beyond conventional approaches, recent advances in large language models and multimodal integration reveal both opportunities and challenges in platform scalability, data protection, and system reliability.

Despite recent advancements in BEV generation, inherent noise, stemming from sensor limitations and the learning process, remains largely unaddressed, resulting in suboptimal BEV representations that adversely impact the performance of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose BEVDiffuser, a novel diffusion model that effectively denoises BEV feature maps using the ground-truth object layout as guidance. BEVDiffuser can be operated in a plug-and-play manner during training time to enhance existing BEV models without requiring any architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate BEVDiffuser's exceptional denoising and generation capabilities, which enable significant enhancement to existing BEV models, as evidenced by notable improvements of 12.3\% in mAP and 10.1\% in NDS achieved for 3D object detection without introducing additional computational complexity. Moreover, substantial improvements in long-tail object detection and under challenging weather and lighting conditions further validate BEVDiffuser's effectiveness in denoising and enhancing BEV representations.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

While these systems integrate a variety of technologies and offer numerous benefits, their security is paramount, as vulnerabilities can have severe consequences for safety and trust. This study aims to systematically investigate potential security weaknesses in the codebases of prominent open-source ADS projects using CodeQL, a static code analysis tool. The goal is to identify common vulnerabilities, their distribution and persistence across versions to enhance the security of ADS. We selected three representative open-source ADS projects, Autoware, AirSim, and Apollo, based on their high GitHub star counts and Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities. Using CodeQL, we analyzed multiple versions of these projects to identify vulnerabilities, focusing on CWE categories such as CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). We also tracked the lifecycle of these vulnerabilities across software versions. This approach allows us to systematically analyze vulnerabilities in projects, which has not been extensively explored in previous ADS research. Our analysis revealed that specific CWE categories, particularly CWE-190 (59.6%) and CWE-20 (16.1%), were prevalent across the selected ADS projects. These vulnerabilities often persisted for over six months, spanning multiple version iterations. The empirical assessment showed a direct link between the severity of these vulnerabilities and their tangible effects on ADS performance. These security issues among ADS still remain to be resolved. Our findings highlight the need for integrating static code analysis into ADS development to detect and mitigate common vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in Information and Software Technology, 2025</p></details> | None |

Recently, advanced multi-modal methods incorporating camera information have achieved notable performance. For a safe and effective autonomous driving system, algorithms that excel not only in accuracy but also in speed and low latency are essential. However, existing algorithms fail to meet these requirements due to the latency and bandwidth limitations of fixed frame rate sensors, e.g., LiDAR and camera. To address this limitation, we introduce asynchronous event cameras into 3D object detection for the first time. We leverage their high temporal resolution and low bandwidth to enable high-speed 3D object detection. Our method enables detection even during inter-frame intervals when synchronized data is unavailable, by retrieving previous 3D information through the event camera. Furthermore, we introduce the first event-based 3D object detection dataset, DSEC-3DOD, which includes ground-truth 3D bounding boxes at 100 FPS, establishing the first benchmark for event-based 3D detectors.

But despite the growing amount of overall data, it is still difficult to train bigger and better models due to inconsistency in taxonomy and/or labeling policies of different datasets. To this end, we propose a knowledge distillation approach that also serves as a label space unification method for semantic segmentation. In short, a teacher model is trained on a source dataset with a given taxonomy, then used to pseudo-label additional data for which ground truth labels of a related label space exist. By mapping the related taxonomies to the source taxonomy, we create constraints within which the model can predict pseudo-labels. Using the improved pseudo-labels we train student models that consistently outperform their teachers in two challenging domains, namely urban and off-road driving. Our ground truth-corrected pseudo-labels span over 12 and 7 public datasets with 388.230 and 18.558 images for the urban and off-road domains, respectively, creating the largest compound datasets for autonomous driving to date.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PFSD: A Multi-Modal Pedestrian-Focus Scene Dataset for Rich Tasks in Semi-Structured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15342v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in autonomous driving perception have revealed exceptional capabilities within structured environments dominated by vehicular traffic. However, current perception models exhibit significant limitations in semi-structured environments, where dynamic pedestrians with more diverse irregular movement and occlusion prevail. We attribute this shortcoming to the scarcity of high-quality datasets in semi-structured scenes, particularly concerning pedestrian perception and prediction. In this work, we present the multi-modal Pedestrian-Focused Scene Dataset(PFSD), rigorously annotated in semi-structured scenes with the format of nuScenes. PFSD provides comprehensive multi-modal data annotations with point cloud segmentation, detection, and object IDs for tracking. It encompasses over 130,000 pedestrian instances captured across various scenarios with varying densities, movement patterns, and occlusions. Furthermore, to demonstrate the importance of addressing the challenges posed by more diverse and complex semi-structured environments, we propose a novel Hybrid Multi-Scale Fusion Network (HMFN). Specifically, to detect pedestrians in densely populated and occluded scenarios, our method effectively captures and fuses multi-scale features using a meticulously designed hybrid framework that integrates sparse and vanilla convolutions. Extensive experiments on PFSD demonstrate that HMFN attains improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) over existing methods, thereby underscoring its efficacy in addressing the challenges of 3D pedestrian detection in complex semi-structured environments.

Recently, researchers have explored employing neural radiance fields or diffusion models to generate novel views or synthetic data under driving scenes. However, these approaches suffer from unseen scenes or restricted video length, thus lacking sufficient adaptability for data generation and simulation. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective framework, named Glad, to generate video data in a frame-by-frame style. To ensure the temporal consistency of synthetic video, we introduce a latent variable propagation module, which views the latent features of previous frame as noise prior and injects it into the latent features of current frame. In addition, we design a streaming data sampler to orderly sample the original image in a video clip at continuous iterations. Given the reference frame, our Glad can be viewed as a streaming simulator by generating the videos for specific scenes. Extensive experiments are performed on the widely-used nuScenes dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Glad achieves promising performance, serving as a strong baseline for online video generation. We will release the source code and models publicly.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 | None |

However, these approaches often neglect potential enhancements in 3D detection processes, leading to high false positives (FP), missed detections (FN), and identity switches (IDS), particularly in challenging scenarios such as crowded scenes, small-object configurations, and adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, limitations in data preprocessing, association mechanisms, motion modeling, and life-cycle management hinder overall tracking robustness. To address these issues, we present Easy-Poly, a real-time, filter-based 3D MOT framework for multiple object categories. Our contributions include: (1) An Augmented Proposal Generator utilizing multi-modal data augmentation and refined SpConv operations, significantly improving mAP and NDS on nuScenes; (2) A Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO) data association algorithm that effectively manages uncertainties and occlusions through optimal assignment and multiple hypothesis handling; (3) A Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM) incorporating a confidence-weighted Kalman filter and adaptive noise covariances, enhancing MOTA and AMOTA in challenging conditions; and (4) An extended life-cycle management system with adjustive thresholds to reduce ID switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30% to 64.96% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1% to 74.5%), while also running in real-time. These findings highlight Easy-Poly's adaptability and robustness in diverse scenarios, making it a compelling choice for autonomous driving and related 3D MOT applications.

In this work, we present a novel learning-based local planner that addresses these challenges by directly capturing human driving nuances from real-world demonstrations using only a monocular camera. The key features of our planner are its ability to navigate in challenging off-road environments with various terrain types and its fast learning capabilities. By utilizing minimal human demonstration data (5-10 mins), it quickly learns to navigate in a wide array of off-road conditions. The local planner significantly reduces the real world data required to learn human driving preferences. This allows the planner to apply learned behaviors to real-world scenarios without the need for manual fine-tuning, demonstrating quick adjustment and adaptability in off-road autonomous driving technology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Provably Efficient RL for Linear MDPs under Instantaneous Safety Constraints in Non-Convex Feature Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18655v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Reinforcement Learning (RL), tasks with instantaneous hard constraints present significant challenges, particularly when the decision space is non-convex or non-star-convex. This issue is especially relevant in domains like autonomous vehicles and robotics, where constraints such as collision avoidance often take a non-convex form. In this paper, we establish a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(\bigl(1 + \tfrac{1}{\tau}\bigr) \sqrt{\log(\tfrac{1}{\tau}) d^3 H^4 K} \bigr)$, applicable to both star-convex and non-star-convex cases, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ the episode length, $K$ the number of episodes, and $\tau$ the safety threshold. Moreover, the violation of safety constraints is zero with high probability throughout the learning process. A key technical challenge in these settings is bounding the covering number of the value-function class, which is essential for achieving value-aware uniform concentration in model-free function approximation. For the star-convex setting, we develop a novel technique called Objective Constraint-Decomposition (OCD) to properly bound the covering number. This result also resolves an error in a previous work on constrained RL. In non-star-convex scenarios, where the covering number can become infinitely large, we propose a two-phase algorithm, Non-Convex Safe Least Squares Value Iteration (NCS-LSVI), which first reduces uncertainty about the safe set by playing a known safe policy. After that, it carefully balances exploration and exploitation to achieve the regret bound. Finally, numerical simulations on an autonomous driving scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of NCS-LSVI.</p></details> |  | None |

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

In this sense, it hinders their effective deployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by providing attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the model to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the driver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E better aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for navigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality importance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach dynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that the complementary information from visual and textual modality is effectively utilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our method facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving environments. We evaluate VLM-E2E on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, showcasing significant improvements in performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) strategies, designed atop standard chip architectures, are both cost-effective and adaptable to different architectures, making them particularly attractive. However, traditional ABFT relies on precise error metrics, triggering error recovery procedures even for minor computational deviations. These minor errors often do not impact the accuracy of the neural network model due to the inherent fault tolerance. To address this inefficiency, we propose an approximate ABFT approach, called ApproxABFT, which initiates error recovery only when computational errors are significant. This approach avoids unnecessary recovery procedures, streamlines the error recovery process, and focuses on correcting impactful errors, ultimately enhancing recovery quality. Additionally, ApproxABFT incorporates a fine-grained blocking strategy to smooth error sensitivity across layers within neural network models. Experimental results demonstrate that ApproxABFT reduces the computing overhead by 67.83\% and improves the tolerable bit error rate by an order of magnitude on average compared to classical accurate ABFT.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper explores Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) scents for mitigating. Two human-involved studies have been conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Study 1 maps six prevalent TCM scents onto the arousal/valence circumplex to select proper candidates, i.e., argy wormwood (with the highest arousal) and tangerine peel (with the highest valence). Study 2 tests both scents in an auto-driving course. Statistics show both scents can improve driver alertness and reaction-time, but should be used in different ways: argy wormwood is suitable for short-term use due to its higher intensity but poor acceptance, while tangerine peel is ideal for long-term use due to its higher likeness. These findings provide insights for in-car fatigue mitigation to enhance driver safety and well-being.

A powerful autonomous driving system should be capable of handling images under all conditions, including nighttime. Generating accurate and diverse nighttime semantic segmentation datasets is crucial for enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms in low-light conditions. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach named NPSim, which enables the simulation of realistic nighttime images from real daytime counterparts with monocular inverse rendering and ray tracing. NPSim comprises two key components: mesh reconstruction and relighting. The mesh reconstruction component generates an accurate representation of the scene structure by combining geometric information extracted from the input RGB image and semantic information from its corresponding semantic labels. The relighting component integrates real-world nighttime light sources and material characteristics to simulate the complex interplay of light and object surfaces under low-light conditions. The scope of this thesis mainly focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the mesh reconstruction component. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh reconstruction component in producing high-quality scene meshes and their generality across different autonomous driving datasets. We also propose a detailed experiment plan for evaluating the entire pipeline, including both quantitative metrics in training state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches and human perceptual studies, aiming to indicate the capability of our approach to generate realistic nighttime images and the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

Vectorized representations, which preserve instance-level topological information while reducing computational overhead, have emerged as a promising paradigm. While existing vectorized query-based frameworks often overlook the inherent spatial correlations among intra-instance points, resulting in geometrically inconsistent outputs (e.g., fragmented HD map elements or oscillatory trajectories). To address these limitations, we propose InVDriver, a novel vectorized query-based system that systematically models intra-instance spatial dependencies through masked self-attention layers, thereby enhancing planning accuracy and trajectory smoothness. Across all core modules, i.e., perception, prediction, and planning, InVDriver incorporates masked self-attention mechanisms that restrict attention to intra-instance point interactions, enabling coordinated refinement of structural elements while suppressing irrelevant inter-instance noise. Experimental results on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that InVDriver achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods in both accuracy and safety, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Our work validates that explicit modeling of intra-instance geometric coherence is critical for advancing vectorized autonomous driving systems, bridging the gap between theoretical advantages of end-to-end frameworks and practical deployment requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to JICV (Journal of Intelligent and Connected Vehicles)</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p></details> |  | None |

However, challenges arise when the teacher's predictions are noisy, or the data domain during student training shifts from the teacher's pretraining data. In such scenarios, blindly relying on the teacher's predictions can lead to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and universal framework, Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Knowledge Transfer ($\textbf{AUKT}$), which leverages Conformal Prediction (CP) to dynamically adjust the student's reliance on the teacher's guidance based on the teacher's prediction uncertainty. CP is a distribution-free, model-agnostic approach that provides reliable prediction sets with statistical coverage guarantees and minimal computational overhead. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the risk of learning undesirable or incorrect knowledge. We validate the proposed framework across diverse applications, including image classification, imitation-guided reinforcement learning, and autonomous driving. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach improves performance, robustness and transferability, offering a promising direction for enhanced knowledge transfer in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CAML: Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17821v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modality learning has become a crucial technique for improving the performance of machine learning applications across domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and perception systems. While existing frameworks such as Auxiliary Modality Learning (AML) effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they primarily operate in a single-agent context. This limitation is particularly critical in dynamic environments, such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. To address these challenges, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning ($\textbf{CAML}$), a novel multi-agent multi-modality framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multimodal data during training while allowing inference with reduced modalities per agent during testing. We systematically analyze the effectiveness of $\textbf{CAML}$ from the perspective of uncertainty reduction and data coverage, providing theoretical insights into its advantages over AML. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that \ours~achieves up to a ${\bf 58.13}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate $\textbf{CAML}$ on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.61}\%$ improvement in mIoU.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods face challenges such as insufficient spatio-temporal modeling and inherent loss of fine-grained feature during voxelization. However, the success of Mamba, a representative state space model (SSM) that enables global modeling with linear complexity, provides a promising solution. In this paper, we propose MambaFlow, a novel scene flow estimation network with a mamba-based decoder. It enables deep interaction and coupling of spatio-temporal features using a well-designed backbone. Innovatively, we steer the global attention modeling of voxel-based features with point offset information using an efficient Mamba-based decoder, learning voxel-to-point patterns that are used to devoxelize shared voxel representations into point-wise features. To further enhance the model's generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios, we propose a novel scene-adaptive loss function that automatically adapts to different motion patterns.Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that MambaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed among existing works, enabling accurate flow estimation in real-world urban scenarios.

Therefore, the development of a multi-lane dataset and benchmark is necessary. While recent synthetic scene-based NVS datasets have been prepared for cross-lane benchmarking, they still lack the realism of captured images and point clouds. To further assess the performance of existing methods based on NeRF and 3DGS, we present the first multi-lane dataset registering parallel scans specifically for novel driving view synthesis dataset derived from real-world scans, comprising 25 groups of associated sequences, including 16,000 front-view images, 64,000 surround-view images, and 16,000 LiDAR frames. All frames are labeled to differentiate moving objects from static elements. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing approaches in various testing scenarios at different lanes and distances. Additionally, our method provides the solution for solving and assessing the quality of multi-sensor poses for multi-modal data alignment for curating such a dataset in real-world.

Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their exceptional planning and reasoning capabilities, have been integrated into ADSs to assist with driving decision-making. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advancements in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs have focused on improving inter-agent communication and cooperation. This paper provides a frontier survey of LLM-based multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based approaches based on different agent interaction modes.

However, the inflexibility in motion control of object targets and the absence of intelligent interactive testing methods often result in pre-fixed and limited testing scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 5G cloud-controlled track testing framework, Real-world Troublemaker. This framework overcomes the rigidity of traditional pre-programmed control by leveraging 5G cloud-controlled object targets integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicle teleoperation technologies. Unlike conventional testing methods that rely on pre-set conditions, we propose a dynamic game strategy based on a quadratic risk interaction utility function, facilitating intelligent interactions with the vehicle under test (VUT) and creating a more realistic and dynamic interaction environment. The proposed framework has been successfully implemented at the Tongji University Intelligent Connected Vehicle Evaluation Base. Field test results demonstrate that Troublemaker can perform dynamic interactive testing of ADS accurately and effectively. Compared to traditional methods, Troublemaker improves scenario reproduction accuracy by 65.2\%, increases the diversity of interaction strategies by approximately 9.2 times, and enhances exposure frequency of safety-critical scenarios by 3.5 times in unprotected left-turn scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,14 figures,2 tables</p></details> | None |

The integration of autonomous driving in military settings reduces human casualties and enables precise and safe execution of missions in hazardous environments while allowing for reliable logistics support without the risks associated with fatigue-related errors. However, relying on autonomous driving solely requires an advanced decision-making model that is adaptable and optimum in any situation. Considering the presence of numerous interconnected autonomous vehicles in mission-critical scenarios, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) is vital for ensuring seamless coordination, real-time data exchange, and instantaneous response to dynamic driving environments. The advent of 6G strengthens the Internet of Automated Defense Vehicles (IoADV) concept within the realm of Internet of Military Defense Things (IoMDT) by enabling robust connectivity, crucial for real-time data exchange, advanced navigation, and enhanced safety features through IoADV interactions. On the other hand, a critical advancement in this space is using pre-trained Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making and communication optimization for autonomous driving. Hence, this work presents opportunities and challenges with a vision of realizing the full potential of these technologies in critical defense applications, especially through the advancement of IoADV and its role in enhancing autonomous military operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Internet of Things Magazine</p></details> | None |

The ability to detect anomalous situations outside of the operational design domain is a key component in self-driving cars, enabling us to mitigate the impact of abnormal ego behaviors and to realize trustworthy driving systems. On-road anomaly detection in egocentric videos remains a challenging problem due to the difficulties introduced by complex and interactive scenarios. We conduct a holistic analysis of common on-road anomaly patterns, from which we propose three unsupervised anomaly detection experts: a scene expert that focuses on frame-level appearances to detect abnormal scenes and unexpected scene motions; an interaction expert that models normal relative motions between two road participants and raises alarms whenever anomalous interactions emerge; and a behavior expert which monitors abnormal behaviors of individual objects by future trajectory prediction. To combine the strengths of all the modules, we propose an expert ensemble (Xen) using a Kalman filter, in which the final anomaly score is absorbed as one of the states and the observations are generated by the experts. Our experiments employ a novel evaluation protocol for realistic model performance, demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance than previous methods, and show that our framework has potential in classifying anomaly types using unsupervised learning on a large-scale on-road anomaly dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often struggle in dynamic driving environments, as they usually focus on static images or videos and rely on downsampling to manage computational costs. This results in the loss of critical details and the difficulty in effectively integrating spatial and temporal information, undermining fine-grained perception and temporal coherence essential for effective decision-making. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LaVida Drive, a novel and efficient VQA framework for autonomous driving. LaVida Drive seamlessly integrates temporal data while maintaining high-resolution inputs for detailed visual perception. It optimizes spatial processing by retaining high-resolution data for intricate details and using lower-resolution inputs for temporal analysis to focus on motion-related features, thereby boosting computational efficiency. The core of LaVida Drive consists of two modules: the \textit{Query-aware Token Selection} module and the \textit{Spatial-Temporal Token Recovery and Enhancement} module. The former dynamically selects the most relevant visual tokens based on semantic alignment with the input query, reducing the token count from high-resolution spatial input. The latter ensures smooth and coherent interactions between spatial and temporal information, preserving contextual continuity across frames. Extensive experiments on various autonomous driving question-answering benchmarks show that LaVida Drive significantly reduces visual tokens, enhances efficiency, and improves overall performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in real-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following this idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic for autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a 'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this attack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized on a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a comprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches trained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S, PIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the Segformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of our analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study reveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs. Transformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude that although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images of any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular model are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true for both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that for CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike ViTs. Per-class analysis reveals that simple-classes like 'sky' suffer less misclassification than others.

The main benefit of the proposed concept and the experiment is that the interaction between the pedestrian and the socially compliant autonomous vehicle leads to smoother traffic. Furthermore, the experiment features a novel human-in-the-decision-loop aspect, meaning that the test subjects have no expected behavior or defined sequence of their actions, better imitating real traffic scenarios. Results show that intention-aware decision-making algorithms are more effective in realistic conditions and contribute to smoother traffic flow than state-of-the-art solutions.

To ensure accurate and reliable environmental perception, intelligent vehicles must exhibit accuracy and robustness in various environments. Millimeter-wave radar, known for its high penetration capability, can operate effectively in adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. Traditional 3D millimeter-wave radars can only provide range, Doppler, and azimuth information for objects. Although the recent emergence of 4D millimeter-wave radars has added elevation resolution, the radar point clouds remain sparse due to Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) operations. In contrast, cameras offer rich semantic details but are sensitive to lighting and weather conditions. Hence, this paper leverages these two highly complementary and cost-effective sensors, 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera. By integrating 4D radar spectra with depth-aware camera images and employing attention mechanisms, we fuse texture-rich images with depth-rich radar data in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective, enhancing 3D object detection. Additionally, we propose using GAN-based networks to generate depth images from radar spectra in the absence of depth sensors, further improving detection accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their quantization performance significantly degrades when INT8 inference is required, with a degradation of 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. To address this issue, we propose a quantization-aware position embedding transformation for multi-view 3D object detection, termed Q-PETR. Q-PETR offers a quantizationfriendly and deployment-friendly architecture while preserving the original performance of PETR. It substantially narrows the accuracy gap between INT8 and FP32 inference for PETR-series methods. Without bells and whistles, our approach reduces the mAP and NDS drop to within 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Furthermore, our method exceeds the performance of the original PETR in terms of floating-point precision. Extensive experiments across a variety of PETR-series models demonstrate its broad generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Amidst the ongoing digital transformation, the ur-gency of adapting risk management to changing needs seems higher than ever. This paper starts with a brief historic overview of the development of risk management in the past. The paper motivates the views that for com-plex systems, risk should be controlled by enforcing constrains in a modular way at different system levels, that the constraints can be expressed as assur-ance contracts and that acceptable risk mitigation can be demonstrated in as-surance case modules. Based on extensive industry experience of the authors, a major contribution is to explain how already existing methodologies have been combined to cre-ate a concept for modular risk assessment. Examples from assurance of au-tonomous sea navigation and autonomous driving are used to illustrate the concept. Beyond the existing methodologies this paper generalizes risk con-straints to assurance contracts as an enabler of modular risk assessment spanning all relevant system levels and stakeholder perspectives while main-taining the dependencies between the system parts and accounting for emer-gent system behavior. Furthermore, the use of safety integrity levels (SIL) and similar concepts for assigning assurance rigor have been avoided in favor of direct assessment of assurance case argument rigor, because technology and applications change too fast to justify using past experience as evidence of validity of such prescriptive schemes. This paper aims to help practitioners making efficient and timely risk-informed decisions about complex integrated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Safecomp 2025</p></details> | None |

This approach often falls short in meeting the real-time, task-specific demands of modern AI-driven applications such as autonomous driving and semantic segmentation. As a new design principle, task-oriented communications have been developed. However, it typically requires joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and modified inference neural networks, resulting in extensive cross-system redesigns and compatibility issues. This paper proposes a novel communication framework that aligns reconstruction-oriented and task-oriented communications for edge intelligence. The idea is to extend the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to optimize data transmission by minimizing task-relevant loss function, while maintaining the structure of the original data by an information reshaper. Such an approach integrates task-oriented communications with reconstruction-oriented communications, where a variational approach is designed to handle the intractability of mutual information in high-dimensional neural network features. We also introduce a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) modulation scheme compatible with classical modulation techniques, enabling the deployment of AI technologies within existing digital infrastructures. The proposed framework is particularly effective in edge-based autonomous driving scenarios. Our evaluation in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces bits per service by 99.19% compared to existing methods, such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, without compromising the effectiveness of task execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)</p></details> | None |

VMMR has been widely utilized for detecting suspicious vehicles, monitoring urban traffic, and autonomous driving systems. The complexity of VMMR arises from the subtle visual distinctions among vehicle models and the wide variety of classes produced by manufacturers. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a prominent type of deep learning model, have been extensively employed in various computer vision tasks, including VMMR, yielding remarkable results. As VMMR is a fine-grained classification problem, it primarily faces inter-class similarity and intra-class variation challenges. In this study, we implement an attention module to address these challenges and enhance the model's focus on critical areas containing distinguishing features. This module, which does not increase the parameters of the original model, generates three-dimensional (3-D) attention weights to refine the feature map. Our proposed model integrates the attention module into two different locations within the middle section of a convolutional model, where the feature maps from these sections offer sufficient information about the input frames without being overly detailed or overly coarse. The performance of our proposed model, along with state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional and transformer-based models, was evaluated using the Stanford Cars dataset.

This design is however fundamentally restricted due to overlooking the modality-specific strengths and finally hampering the model performance. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a novel modality interaction strategy that allows individual per-modality representations to be learned and maintained throughout, enabling their unique characteristics to be exploited during the whole perception pipeline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we design DeepInteraction++, a multi-modal interaction framework characterized by a multi-modal representational interaction encoder and a multi-modal predictive interaction decoder. Specifically, the encoder is implemented as a dual-stream Transformer with specialized attention operation for information exchange and integration between separate modality-specific representations. Our multi-modal representational learning incorporates both object-centric, precise sampling-based feature alignment and global dense information spreading, essential for the more challenging planning task. The decoder is designed to iteratively refine the predictions by alternately aggregating information from separate representations in a unified modality-agnostic manner, realizing multi-modal predictive interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework on both 3D object detection and end-to-end autonomous driving tasks.

Recent advancements in occupancy forecasting have enabled forecasting future 3D occupied status in driving environments by observing historical 2D images. However, high computational demands make occupancy forecasting less efficient during training and inference stages, hindering its feasibility for deployment on edge agents. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, i.e., OccProphet, to efficiently and effectively learn occupancy forecasting with significantly lower computational requirements while improving forecasting accuracy. OccProphet comprises three lightweight components: Observer, Forecaster, and Refiner. The Observer extracts spatio-temporal features from 3D multi-frame voxels using the proposed Efficient 4D Aggregation with Tripling-Attention Fusion, while the Forecaster and Refiner conditionally predict and refine future occupancy inferences. Experimental results on nuScenes, Lyft-Level5, and nuScenes-Occupancy datasets demonstrate that OccProphet is both training- and inference-friendly. OccProphet reduces 58\%$\sim$78\% of the computational cost with a 2.6$\times$ speedup compared with the state-of-the-art Cam4DOcc. Moreover, it achieves 4\%$\sim$18\% relatively higher forecasting accuracy.

While existing research has explored generating safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle (AV) testing, there is limited work on effectively incorporating these scenarios into policy learning to enhance safety. Furthermore, developing training curricula that adapt to an AV's evolving behavioral patterns and performance bottlenecks remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose CurricuVLM, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable personalized curriculum learning for autonomous driving agents. Our approach uniquely exploits VLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities to analyze agent behavior, identify performance weaknesses, and dynamically generate tailored training scenarios for curriculum adaptation. Through comprehensive analysis of unsafe driving situations with narrative descriptions, CurricuVLM performs in-depth reasoning to evaluate the AV's capabilities and identify critical behavioral patterns. The framework then synthesizes customized training scenarios targeting these identified limitations, enabling effective and personalized curriculum learning.

To address these limitations, we propose TeLL-Drive, a hybrid framework that integrates a Teacher LLM to guide an attention-based Student DRL policy. By incorporating risk metrics, historical scenario retrieval, and domain heuristics into context-rich prompts, the LLM produces high-level driving strategies through chain-of-thought reasoning. A self-attention mechanism then fuses these strategies with the DRL agent's exploration, accelerating policy convergence and boosting robustness across diverse driving conditions. The experimental results, evaluated across multiple traffic scenarios, show that TeLL-Drive outperforms existing baseline methods, including other LLM-based approaches, in terms of success rates, average returns, and real-time feasibility. Ablation studies underscore the importance of each model component, especially the synergy between the attention mechanism and LLM-driven guidance. Finally, we build a virtual-real fusion experimental platform to verify the real-time performance, robustness, and reliability of the algorithm running on real vehicles through vehicle-in-loop experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing SSC methods are limited to capturing sparse information from the current frame or naively stacking multi-frame temporal features, thereby failing to acquire effective scene context. These approaches ignore critical motion dynamics and struggle to achieve temporal consistency. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel temporal SSC method FlowScene: Learning Temporal 3D Semantic Scene Completion via Optical Flow Guidance. By leveraging optical flow, FlowScene can integrate motion, different viewpoints, occlusions, and other contextual cues, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of 3D scene completion. Specifically, our framework introduces two key components: (1) a Flow-Guided Temporal Aggregation module that aligns and aggregates temporal features using optical flow, capturing motion-aware context and deformable structures; and (2) an Occlusion-Guided Voxel Refinement module that injects occlusion masks and temporally aggregated features into 3D voxel space, adaptively refining voxel representations for explicit geometric modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowScene achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based fusion methods. However, these models frequently encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes in real-world applications, which severely impact their performance and reliability. Therefore, addressing the challenge of OOD data is crucial for the safe deployment of these models in open-world environments. Unlike existing research, our focus is on the challenges posed by OOD data in real-world applications and on enhancing the robustness and generalization of models. In this paper, we propose an infrared-visible fusion framework based on Multi-View Augmentation. For external data augmentation, Top-k Selective Vision Alignment is employed to mitigate distribution shifts between datasets by performing RGB-wise transformations on visible images. This strategy effectively introduces augmented samples, enhancing the adaptability of the model to complex real-world scenarios. Additionally, for internal data augmentation, self-supervised learning is established using Weak-Aggressive Augmentation. This enables the model to learn more robust and general feature representations during the fusion process, thereby improving robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance and robustness across various conditions and environments. Our approach significantly enhances the reliability and stability of IVIF tasks in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE T-CSVT.

To advance research in such safety-critical systems, determining the precise contribution of spectral information to complex DNNs' output is needed. To address this, several saliency methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), have been proposed primarily for image classification. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding their reliability. In this paper, we address their limitations and propose an alternative approach by leveraging the data provided by activations and weights from relevant DNN layers to better capture the relationship between input features and predictions. The study aims to assess the superior performance of HSI compared to 3-channel and single-channel DNNs. We also address the influence of spectral signature normalization for enhancing DNN robustness in real-world driving conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios without discretization approximations. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving.

Recently, with the development of more accurate and robust neural network models and different types of datasets, monocular depth estimation has significantly improved performance and efficiency. However, most of the research in this area focuses on very concentrated domains. In particular, most of the benchmarks in outdoor scenarios belong to urban environments for the improvement of autonomous driving devices, and these benchmarks have a massive disparity with the orchard/vineyard environment, which is hardly helpful for research in the primary industry. Therefore, we propose OrchardDepth, which fills the gap in the estimation of the metric depth of the monocular camera in the orchard/vineyard environment. In addition, we present a new retraining method to improve the training result by monitoring the consistent regularization between dense depth maps and sparse points. Our method improves the RMSE of depth estimation in the orchard environment from 1.5337 to 0.6738, proving our method's validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation, ACRA, 2024</p></details> | None |

With advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), previous studies have applied it to reconstruct complex dynamic driving scenes. These methods typically require expensive LiDAR sensors and pre-annotated datasets of dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, simulations play an important role in efficient development of planning algorithms. To be effective, simulations must be accurate and realistic, both in terms of dynamics and behavior modeling, and also highly customizable in order to accommodate a broad spectrum of research frameworks. In this paper, we introduce SMARTS 2.0, the second generation of our motion planning simulator which, in addition to being highly optimized for large-scale simulation, provides many new features, such as realistic map integration, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, traffic and pedestrian simulation, and a broad variety of sensor models. Moreover, we present a novel benchmark suite for evaluating planning algorithms in various highly challenging scenarios, including interactive driving, such as turning at intersections, and adaptive driving, in which the task is to closely follow a lead vehicle without any explicit knowledge of its intention. Each scenario is characterized by a variety of traffic patterns and road structures. We further propose a series of common and task-specific metrics to effectively evaluate the performance of the planning algorithms. At the end, we evaluate common motion planning algorithms using the proposed benchmark and highlight the challenges the proposed scenarios impose.

However, existing SSC methods often overlook the high deployment costs in real-world applications. Traditional architectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and self-attention mechanisms, face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for SSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the Mamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic segmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and geometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge. Using simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception training of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive labels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a dual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling efficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing long-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks with deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming competing models while also reducing deployment costs.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional multi-object tracking, RMOT identifies and tracks objects and incorporates textual descriptions for object class names, making the approach more intuitive. Various techniques have been proposed to address this challenging problem; however, most require the training of the entire network due to their end-to-end nature. Among these methods, iKUN has emerged as a particularly promising solution. Therefore, we further explore its pipeline and enhance its performance. In this paper, we introduce a practical module dubbed Memory-Efficient Cross-modality -- MEX. This memory-efficient technique can be directly applied to off-the-shelf trackers like iKUN, resulting in significant architectural improvements. Our method proves effective during inference on a single GPU with 4 GB of memory. Among the various benchmarks, the Refer-KITTI dataset, which offers diverse autonomous driving scenes with relevant language expressions, is particularly useful for studying this problem.

Current benchmarks predominantly focus on urban terrains, specifically for on-road autonomous driving, leaving multi-degraded, densely vegetated, dynamic and feature-sparse environments, such as underground tunnels, natural fields, and modern indoor spaces underrepresented. To fill this gap, we introduce EnvoDat, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset collected in diverse environments and conditions, including high illumination, fog, rain, and zero visibility at different times of the day. Overall, EnvoDat contains 26 sequences from 13 scenes, 10 sensing modalities, over 1.9TB of data, and over 89K fine-grained polygon-based annotations for more than 82 object and terrain classes.

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards that guide the policy to effectively respond to safety-critical events and understand real-world causal relationships. For better alignment with human driving behavior, IL is incorporated into RL training as a regularization term.

Traditional performance metrics, such as accuracy, focus on overall error rates but fail to account for the confidence of incorrect predictions, thereby overlooking the risk of confident misjudgments. This risk is particularly significant in cost-sensitive and safety-critical domains like medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, where overconfident false predictions may cause severe consequences. To address this issue, we introduce the Fragility Index (FI), a novel metric that evaluates classification performance from a risk-averse perspective by explicitly capturing the tail risk of confident misjudgments. To enhance generalizability, we define FI within the robust satisficing (RS) framework, incorporating data uncertainty. We further develop a model training approach that optimizes FI while maintaining tractability for common loss functions. Specifically, we derive exact reformulations for cross-entropy loss, hinge-type loss, and Lipschitz loss, and extend the approach to deep learning models. Through synthetic experiments and real-world medical diagnosis tasks, we demonstrate that FI effectively identifies misjudgment risk and FI-based training improves model robustness and generalizability. Finally, we extend our framework to deep neural network training, further validating its effectiveness in enhancing deep learning models.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional research has predominantly centered on maximizing recommendation accuracy, often leading to unintended side effects such as echo chambers and constrained user experiences. Drawing inspiration from autonomous driving, we introduce a novel framework that categorizes RS autonomy into five distinct levels, ranging from basic rule-based accuracy-driven systems to behavior-aware, uncertain multi-objective RSs - where users may have varying needs, such as accuracy, diversity, and fairness. In response, we propose an approach that dynamically identifies and optimizes multiple objectives based on individual user preferences, fostering more ethical and intelligent user-centric recommendations. To navigate the uncertainty inherent in multi-objective RSs, we develop a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that captures personalized trade-offs between different objectives while accounting for their uncertain interdependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an orthogonal meta-learning paradigm to enhance BO efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging shared knowledge across similar tasks and mitigating conflicts among objectives through the discovery of orthogonal information. Finally, extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in optimizing uncertain multi-objectives for individual users, paving the way for more adaptive and user-focused RSs.</p></details> |  | None |

Slice discovery methods (SDMs) are prominent algorithmic approaches for finding such systematic weaknesses. They identify top-k semantically coherent slices/subsets of data where a DNN-under-test has low performance. For being directly useful, e.g., as evidences in a safety argumentation, slices should be aligned with human-understandable (safety-relevant) dimensions, which, for example, are defined by safety and domain experts as parts of the operational design domain (ODD). While straightforward for structured data, the lack of semantic metadata makes these investigations challenging for unstructured data. Therefore, we propose a complete workflow which combines contemporary foundation models with algorithms for combinatorial search that consider structured data and DNN errors for finding systematic weaknesses in images. In contrast to existing approaches, ours identifies weak slices that are in line with predefined human-understandable dimensions. As the workflow includes foundation models, its intermediate and final results may not always be exact. Therefore, we build into our workflow an approach to address the impact of noisy metadata. We evaluate our approach w.r.t. its quality on four popular computer vision datasets, including autonomous driving datasets like Cityscapes, BDD100k, and RailSem19, while using multiple state-of-the-art models as DNNs-under-test.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on detection and tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates an LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark.

In order to address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for bandwidth-adaptive spatiotemporal CoID in collaborative perception. This approach allows robots to progressively select partial spatiotemporal observations and share with others, while adapting to communication constraints that dynamically change over time. We evaluate our approach across various scenarios in connected autonomous driving simulations. Experimental results validate that our approach enables CoID and adapts to dynamic communication bandwidth changes. In addition, our approach achieves 8%-56% overall improvements in terms of covisible object retrieval for CoID and data sharing efficiency, which outperforms previous techniques and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025).

In a long period, researchers have made significant endeavors to accurately model vehicle dynamics. Traditional physics-based methods employ mathematical formulae to model vehicle dynamics, but they are unable to adequately describe complex vehicle systems due to the simplifications they entail. Recent advancements in deep learning-based methods have addressed this limitation by directly regressing vehicle dynamics. However, the performance and generalization capabilities still require further enhancement. In this letter, we address these problems by proposing a vehicle dynamics correction system that leverages deep neural networks to correct the state residuals of a physical model instead of directly estimating the states. This system greatly reduces the difficulty of network learning and thus improves the estimation accuracy of vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, we have developed a novel Transformer-based dynamics residual correction network, DyTR. This network implicitly represents state residuals as high-dimensional queries, and iteratively updates the estimated residuals by interacting with dynamics state features. The experiments in simulations demonstrate the proposed system works much better than physics model, and our proposed DyTR model achieves the best performances on dynamics state residual correction task, reducing the state prediction errors of a simple 3 DoF vehicle model by an average of 92.3% and 59.9% in two dataset, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

The prevailing driving world model mainly build on video prediction model. Although these models can produce high-fidelity video sequences with advanced diffusion-based generator, they are constrained by their predictive duration and overall generalization capabilities. In this paper, we explore to solve this problem by combining generation loss with MAE-style feature-level context learning. In particular, we instantiate this target with three key design: (1) A more scalable Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure trained with extra mask construction task. (2) we devise diffusion-related mask tokens to deal with the fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction and generative diffusion process. (3) we extend mask construction task to spatial-temporal domain by utilizing row-wise mask for shifted self-attention rather than masked self-attention in MAE. Then, we adopt a row-wise cross-view module to align with this mask design. Based on above improvement, we propose MaskGWM: a Generalizable driving World Model embodied with Video Mask reconstruction. Our model contains two variants: MaskGWM-long, focusing on long-horizon prediction, and MaskGWM-mview, dedicated to multi-view generation. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which contain normal validation of Nuscene dataset, long-horizon rollout of OpenDV-2K dataset and zero-shot validation of Waymo dataset. Quantitative metrics on these datasets show our method notably improving state-of-the-art driving world model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Continual Adaptation for Autonomous Driving with the Mixture of Progressive Experts Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05943v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based autonomous driving requires continuous integration of diverse knowledge in complex traffic , yet existing methods exhibit significant limitations in adaptive capabilities. Addressing this gap demands autonomous driving systems that enable continual adaptation through dynamic adjustments to evolving environmental interactions. This underscores the necessity for enhanced continual learning capabilities to improve system adaptability. To address these challenges, the paper introduces a dynamic progressive optimization framework that facilitates adaptation to variations in dynamic environments, achieved by integrating reinforcement learning and supervised learning for data aggregation. Building on this framework, we propose the Mixture of Progressive Experts (MoPE) network. The proposed method selectively activates multiple expert models based on the distinct characteristics of each task and progressively refines the network architecture to facilitate adaptation to new tasks. Simulation results show that the MoPE model outperforms behavior cloning methods, achieving up to a 7.8% performance improvement in intricate urban road environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[CoDiff: Conditional Diffusion Model for Collaborative 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14891v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field of autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of each individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple agents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.</p></details> |  | None |

To represent these kinds of domains, we adopt hidden-parameter Markov decision processes (HIP-MDPs), which model sequential decision problems where hidden variables parameterize transition and reward functions. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, and meta-learning, simply treat the effect of hidden parameters as additional variance and often struggle to effectively handle HIP-MDP problems, especially when the rewards are parameterized by hidden variables. We introduce Privileged-Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning framework that extends the existing model-based approach by incorporating an explicit parameter estimation module. PrivilegedDreamer features its novel dual recurrent architecture that explicitly estimates hidden parameters from limited historical data and enables us to condition the model, actor, and critic networks on these estimated parameters. Our empirical analysis on five diverse HIP-MDP tasks demonstrates that PrivilegedDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art model-based, model-free, and domain adaptation learning algorithms. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to justify the inclusion of each component in the proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025.

| **[A Framework for Learning Scoring Rules in Autonomous Driving Planning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11352v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving systems, motion planning is commonly implemented as a two-stage process: first, a trajectory proposer generates multiple candidate trajectories, then a scoring mechanism selects the most suitable trajectory for execution. For this critical selection stage, rule-based scoring mechanisms are particularly appealing as they can explicitly encode driving preferences, safety constraints, and traffic regulations in a formalized, human-understandable format. However, manually crafting these scoring rules presents significant challenges: the rules often contain complex interdependencies, require careful parameter tuning, and may not fully capture the nuances present in real-world driving data. This work introduces FLoRA, a novel framework that bridges this gap by learning interpretable scoring rules represented in temporal logic. Our method features a learnable logic structure that captures nuanced relationships across diverse driving scenarios, optimizing both rules and parameters directly from real-world driving demonstrations collected in NuPlan. Our approach effectively learns to evaluate driving behavior even though the training data only contains positive examples (successful driving demonstrations). Evaluations in closed-loop planning simulations demonstrate that our learned scoring rules outperform existing techniques, including expert-designed rules and neural network scoring models, while maintaining interpretability. This work introduces a data-driven approach to enhance the scoring mechanism in autonomous driving systems, designed as a plug-in module to seamlessly integrate with various trajectory proposers.

The evolution of 3D semantic occupancy prediction as a pretraining task for autonomous driving and robotic applications captures finer 3D details compared to traditional 3D detection methods. Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is increasingly overlooked in favor of LiDAR-based approaches, which have shown superior performance in recent years. However, we present compelling evidence that there is still potential for enhancing vision-based methods. Existing approaches predominantly focus on spatial cues such as tri-perspective view (TPV) embeddings, often overlooking temporal cues. This study introduces S2TPVFormer, a spatiotemporal transformer architecture designed to predict temporally coherent 3D semantic occupancy. By introducing temporal cues through a novel Temporal Cross-View Hybrid Attention mechanism (TCVHA), we generate Spatiotemporal TPV (S2TPV) embeddings that enhance the prior process. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate a significant +4.1% of absolute gain in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for 3D semantic occupancy compared to baseline TPVFormer, validating the effectiveness of S2TPVFormer in advancing 3D scene perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Autonomous Driving at AAAI</p></details> | None |

In particular, world models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: 1) Generation of Future Physical World, covering image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; 2) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; 3) Interaction Between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, long-tail scenario generation, and multimodal fusion to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, our comprehensive analysis provides a theoretical framework and technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | Ongoing project | None |

However, due to their large overhead from dense network structure designs, existing networks face challenges balancing accuracy and latency. In this paper, we introduce OccRWKV, an efficient semantic occupancy network inspired by Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV). OccRWKV separates semantics, occupancy prediction, and feature fusion into distinct branches, each incorporating Sem-RWKV and Geo-RWKV blocks. These blocks are designed to capture long-range dependencies, enabling the network to learn domain-specific representation (i.e., semantics and geometry), which enhances prediction accuracy. Leveraging the sparse nature of real-world 3D occupancy, we reduce computational overhead by projecting features into the bird's-eye view (BEV) space and propose a BEV-RWKV block for efficient feature enhancement and fusion. This enables real-time inference at 22.2 FPS without compromising performance. Experiments demonstrate that OccRWKV outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving a mIoU of 25.1 while being 20 times faster than the best baseline, Co-Occ, making it suitable for real-time deployment on robots to enhance autonomous navigation efficiency.

| **[Enhancing Expressway Ramp Merge Safety and Efficiency via Spatiotemporal Cooperative Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08121v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of autonomous driving on expressways, the issue of ensuring safe and efficient ramp merging remains a significant challenge. Existing systems often struggle to accurately assess the status and intentions of other vehicles, leading to a persistent occurrence of accidents despite efforts to maintain safe distances. This study proposes a novel spatiotemporal cooperative control approach integrating vehicle-road coordination to address this critical issue. A comprehensive methodology is developed, beginning with the calculation of safe distances under varying spatiotemporal conditions. This involves considering multiple factors, including vehicle speed differentials, positioning errors, and clock synchronization errors. Subsequently, an advanced vehicle conflict risk evaluation model is constructed. By incorporating collision acceleration and emergency acceleration as key parameters, this model offers a more accurate and detailed evaluation of potential risks during the ramp merging process. Based on the calculated safe distances and conflict risk evaluations, a mainline priority coordinated control method is formulated. This method enables the pre-planning of vehicle trajectories, effectively reducing conflicts among vehicles. Through rigorous simulations using diverse traffic volume and speed scenarios, the efficacy of the proposed strategy is validated. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements, with the average delay time reduced by an impressive 97.96% and fuel consumption decreased by 6.01%. These outcomes indicate that the proposed approach not only enhances the speed of vehicle merging but also significantly reduces latency and fuel consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of ramp merging operations.</p></details> |  | None |

These threats can have disastrous consequences for the application of artificial intelligence, especially for some applications that take effect immediately, such as autonomous driving and medical fields. Among these threats, backdoor attacks have left a deep impression on people with their concealment and simple deployment, making them a threat that cannot be ignored, however, in the process of deploying the backdoor model, the backdoor attack often has some reasons that make it unsatisfactory in real-world applications, such as jitter and brightness changes. Based on this, we propose a highly robust backdoor attack that shifts the target sample and combines it with itself to form a backdoor sample, the Displacement Backdoor Attack(DBA).

First, in complex scenarios, ADS may misinterpret the environment and make inappropriate driving decisions. Second, these systems are unable to incorporate human driving preferences in their decision-making processes. This paper proposes Autoware$.$Flex, a novel ADS system that incorporates human input into the driving process, allowing users to guide the ADS in making more appropriate decisions and ensuring their preferences are satisfied. Achieving this needs to address two key challenges: (1) translating human instructions, expressed in natural language, into a format the ADS can understand, and (2) ensuring these instructions are executed safely and consistently within the ADS' s decision-making framework. For the first challenge, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) assisted by an ADS-specialized knowledge base to enhance domain-specific translation. For the second challenge, we design a validation mechanism to ensure that human instructions result in safe and consistent driving behavior. Experiments conducted on both simulators and a real-world autonomous vehicle demonstrate that Autoware$.$Flex effectively interprets human instructions and executes them safely.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures | None |

Traditional predict-then-act frameworks are often insufficient or inefficient because accurate inference of human behavior requires a continuous interaction rather than isolated prediction. To address this, we propose an active learning framework in which we rigorously derive predicted belief distributions. Additionally, we introduce a novel model-based diffusion solver tailored for online receding horizon control problems, demonstrated through a complex, non-convex highway merging scenario. Our approach extends previous high-fidelity dual control simulations to hardware experiments, which may be viewed at https://youtu.be/Q_JdZuopGL4, and verifies behavior inference in human-driven traffic scenarios, moving beyond idealized models.

Traditional methods implement perception using occupancy grid mapping (OGM), segmenting the environment into discretized cells with probabilistic information. This classical approach is well-established and provides a structured input for downstream processes like goal finding and path planning algorithms. Recent approaches leverage a biologically inspired mathematical framework known as vector symbolic architectures (VSA), commonly known as hyperdimensional computing, to perform probabilistic OGM in hyperdimensional space. This approach, VSA-OGM, provides native compatibility with spiking neural networks, positioning VSA-OGM as a potential neuromorphic alternative to conventional OGM. However, for large-scale integration, it is essential to assess the performance implications of VSA-OGM on downstream tasks compared to established OGM methods. This study examines the efficacy of VSA-OGM against a traditional OGM approach, Bayesian Hilbert Maps (BHM), within reinforcement learning based goal finding and path planning frameworks, across a controlled exploration environment and an autonomous driving scenario inspired by the F1-Tenth challenge. Our results demonstrate that VSA-OGM maintains comparable learning performance across single and multi-scenario training configurations while improving performance on unseen environments by approximately 47%. These findings highlight the increased generalizability of policy networks trained with VSA-OGM over BHM, reinforcing its potential for real-world deployment in diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Recent methods leverage the range-view representation to improve processing efficiency. To mitigate the performance drop caused by information loss inherent to the "many-to-one" problem, where multiple nearby 3D points are mapped to the same 2D grids and only the closest is retained, prior works tend to choose a higher azimuth resolution for range-view projection. However, this can bring the drawback of reducing the proportion of pixels that carry information and heavier computation within the network. We argue that it is not the optimal solution and show that, in contrast, decreasing the resolution is more advantageous in both efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we present a comprehensive re-design of the workflow for range-view-based LiDAR semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses data representation, augmentation, and post-processing methods for improvements. Through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we demonstrate that our pipeline significantly enhances the performance of various network architectures over their baselines, paving the way for more effective LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional traffic simulators, such as SUMO, often depend on hand-crafted scenarios and rule-based models, where vehicle actions are limited to speed adjustment and lane changes, making it difficult for them to create realistic traffic environments. In recent years, real-world traffic scenario datasets have been developed alongside advancements in autonomous driving, facilitating the rise of data-driven simulators and learning-based simulation methods. However, current data-driven simulators are often restricted to replicating the traffic scenarios and driving styles within the datasets they rely on, limiting their ability to model multi-style driving behaviors observed in the real world. We propose \textit{LCSim}, a large-scale controllable traffic simulator. First, we define a unified data format for traffic scenarios and provide tools to construct them from multiple data sources, enabling large-scale traffic simulation. Furthermore, we integrate a diffusion-based vehicle motion planner into LCSim to facilitate realistic and diverse vehicle modeling.

| **[Predicting Safety Misbehaviours in Autonomous Driving Systems using Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18573v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automated real-time recognition of unexpected situations plays a crucial role in the safety of autonomous vehicles, especially in unsupported and unpredictable scenarios. This paper evaluates different Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods from the deep learning domain for the anticipatory testing of safety-critical misbehaviours during system-level simulation-based testing. Specifically, we compute uncertainty scores as the vehicle executes, following the intuition that high uncertainty scores are indicative of unsupported runtime conditions that can be used to distinguish safe from failure-inducing driving behaviors. In our study, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness and computational overhead associated with two Bayesian uncertainty quantification methods, namely MC- Dropout and Deep Ensembles, for misbehaviour avoidance. Overall, for three benchmarks from the Udacity simulator comprising both out-of-distribution and unsafe conditions introduced via mutation testing, both methods successfully detected a high number of out-of-bounds episodes providing early warnings several seconds in advance, outperforming two state-of-the-art misbehaviour prediction methods based on autoencoders and attention maps in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, Deep Ensembles detected most misbehaviours without any false alarms and did so even when employing a relatively small number of models, making them computationally feasible for real-time detection. Our findings suggest that incorporating uncertainty quantification methods is a viable approach for building fail-safe mechanisms in deep neural network-based autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 17th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation 2024 (ICST '24)</p></details> | None |

However, certain challenges warrant significant attention, including balancing simulation accuracy with duration, reconciling functionality with practicality, and establishing comprehensive evaluation mechanisms. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing the LimSim Series, a comprehensive simulation platform designed to support the rapid deployment and efficient iteration of ADS. The LimSim Series integrates multi-type information from road networks, employs human-like decision-making and planning algorithms for background vehicles, and introduces the concept of the Area of Interest (AoI) to optimize computational resources. The platform offers a variety of baseline algorithms and user-friendly interfaces, facilitating flexible validation of multiple technical pipelines. Additionally, the LimSim Series incorporates multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, delivering thorough insights into system performance, thus enabling researchers to promptly identify issues for further improvements. Experiments demonstrate that the LimSim Series is compatible with modular, end-to-end, and VLM-based knowledge-driven systems.

More specifically, we build on the standard approach of KalmanNet, a recurrent neural network aiming to estimate the underlying system uncertainty of traditional Extended Kalman Filtering, and reformulate it by the adapt-then-combine concept to FedKalmanNet. The latter is trained in a distributed manner by a group of vehicles (or clients), with local training datasets consisting of vehicular location and velocity measurements, through a global server aggregation operation. The FedKalmanNet is then used by each vehicle to localize itself, by estimating the associated system uncertainty matrices (i.e, Kalman gain). Our aim is to actually demonstrate the benefits of collaborative training for state estimation in autonomous driving, over collaborative decision-making which requires rich V2X communication resources for measurement exchange and sensor fusion under real-time constraints. An extensive experimental and evaluation study conducted in CARLA autonomous driving simulator highlights the superior performance of FedKalmanNet over state-of-the-art collaborative decision-making approaches, in localizing vehicles without the need of real-time V2X communication.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current 3D perception methods, especially specialized small models, exhibit poor generalization in open scenarios. On the other hand, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general capacity but underperform in 3D tasks, due to weak 3D local spatial object perception, poor text-based geometric numerical output, and inability to handle camera focal variations. To address these challenges, we propose the following solutions: Spatial-Enhanced Local Feature Mining for better spatial feature extraction, 3D Query Token-Derived Info Decoding for precise geometric regression, and Geometry Projection-Based 3D Reasoning for handling camera focal length variations. We employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning for a pre-trained MLLM and develop LLMI3D, a powerful 3D perception MLLM. Additionally, we have constructed the IG3D dataset, which provides fine-grained descriptions and question-answer annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLMI3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other methods by a large margin.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods follow conventional 2D detectors to first localize object centers, and then predict 3D attributes by neighboring features. However, only using local visual features is insufficient to understand the scene-level 3D spatial structures and ignores the long-range inter-object depth relations. In this paper, we introduce the first DETR framework for Monocular DEtection with a depth-guided TRansformer, named MonoDETR. We modify the vanilla transformer to be depth-aware and guide the whole detection process by contextual depth cues. Specifically, concurrent to the visual encoder that captures object appearances, we introduce to predict a foreground depth map, and specialize a depth encoder to extract non-local depth embeddings. Then, we formulate 3D object candidates as learnable queries and propose a depth-guided decoder to conduct object-scene depth interactions. In this way, each object query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the depth-guided regions on the image and is no longer constrained to local visual features. On KITTI benchmark with monocular images as input, MonoDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires no extra dense depth annotations. Besides, our depth-guided modules can also be plug-and-play to enhance multi-view 3D object detectors on nuScenes dataset, demonstrating our superior generalization capacity.

| **[Topo2Seq: Enhanced Topology Reasoning via Topology Sequence Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08974v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting lane topology from perspective views (PV) is crucial for planning and control in autonomous driving. This approach extracts potential drivable trajectories for self-driving vehicles without relying on high-definition (HD) maps. However, the unordered nature and weak long-range perception of the DETR-like framework can result in misaligned segment endpoints and limited topological prediction capabilities. Inspired by the learning of contextual relationships in language models, the connectivity relations in roads can be characterized as explicit topology sequences. In this paper, we introduce Topo2Seq, a novel approach for enhancing topology reasoning via topology sequences learning. The core concept of Topo2Seq is a randomized order prompt-to-sequence learning between lane segment decoder and topology sequence decoder. The dual-decoder branches simultaneously learn the lane topology sequences extracted from the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and the lane graph containing geometric information. Randomized order prompt-to-sequence learning extracts unordered key points from the lane graph predicted by the lane segment decoder, which are then fed into the prompt design of the topology sequence decoder to reconstruct an ordered and complete lane graph. In this way, the lane segment decoder learns powerful long-range perception and accurate topological reasoning from the topology sequence decoder. Notably, topology sequence decoder is only introduced during training and does not affect the inference efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Topo2Seq in topology reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

To achieve a economical and robust purely visual autonomous driving system, we propose RenderWorld, a vision-only end-to-end autonomous driving framework, which generates 3D occupancy labels using a self-supervised gaussian-based Img2Occ Module, then encodes the labels by AM-VAE, and uses world model for forecasting and planning. RenderWorld employs Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes and render 2D images greatly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces GPU memory consumption compared with NeRF-based methods. By applying AM-VAE to encode air and non-air separately, RenderWorld achieves more fine-grained scene element representation, leading to state-of-the-art performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning from autoregressive world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces FH-DRL, a novel framework that integrates a customizable heuristic function for frontier detection with a Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) agent for continuous, high-speed local navigation. The proposed heuristic relies on an exponential-hyperbolic distance score, which balances immediate proximity against long-range exploration gains, and an occupancy-based stochastic measure, accounting for environmental openness and obstacle densities in real time. By ranking frontiers using these adaptive metrics, FH-DRL targets highly informative yet tractable waypoints, thereby minimizing redundant paths and total exploration time. We thoroughly evaluate FH-DRL across multiple simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating clear improvements in travel distance and completion time over frontier-only or purely DRL-based exploration. In structured corridor layouts and maze-like topologies, our architecture consistently outperforms standard methods such as Nearest Frontier, Cognet Frontier Exploration, and Goal Driven Autonomous Exploration. Real-world tests with a Turtlebot3 platform further confirm robust adaptation to previously unseen or cluttered indoor spaces. The results highlight FH-DRL as an efficient and generalizable approach for frontier-based exploration in large or partially known environments, offering a promising direction for various autonomous driving, industrial, and service robotics tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

A key challenge is generating a diverse set of future predictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives. However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and training instabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, some approaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring a post-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number of predictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, a recently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCL methods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, we demonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motion forecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set of hypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step. Our approach can be easily incorporated into any trajectory prediction model normally trained using WTA and yields significant improvements.

Despite numerous testing methods available that can generate diverse and challenging scenarios to uncover potential vulnerabilities, these methods often treat ADS as a black-box, primarily focusing on identifying system failures like collisions or near-misses without pinpointing the specific modules responsible for these failures. Understanding the root causes of failures is essential for effective debugging and subsequent system repair. We observed that existing methods also fall short in generating diverse failures that adequately test the distinct modules of an ADS, such as perception, prediction, planning and control. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoDitector, the first root-cause-aware testing method for ADS. Unlike previous approaches, MoDitector not only generates scenarios leading to collisions but also showing which specific module triggered the failure. This method targets specific modules, creating test scenarios that highlight the weaknesses of these given modules. Specifically, our approach involves designing module-specific oracles to ascertain module failures and employs a module-directed testing strategy that includes module-specific feedback, adaptive seed selection, and mutation. This strategy guides the generation of tests that effectively provoke module-specific failures. We evaluated MoDitector across four critical ADS modules and four testing scenarios. Our approach represents a significant innovation in ADS testing by focusing on identifying and rectifying module-specific errors within the system, moving beyond conventional black-box failure detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Some researches focus on creating covert adversarial samples, but existing global noise techniques are detectable and difficult to deceive the human visual system. This paper introduces a novel adversarial attack method, AdvSwap, which creatively utilizes wavelet-based high-frequency information swapping to generate covert adversarial samples and fool the camera. AdvSwap employs invertible neural network for selective high-frequency information swapping, preserving both forward propagation and data integrity. The scheme effectively removes the original label data and incorporates the guidance image data, producing concealed and robust adversarial samples. Experimental evaluations and comparisons on the GTSRB and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that AdvSwap can make concealed attacks on common traffic targets. The generates adversarial samples are also difficult to perceive by humans and algorithms. Meanwhile, the method has strong attacking robustness and attacking transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>27th ...</summary><p>27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)</p></details> | None |

Current AVs, however, still lag behind human drivers in adaptability and performance, often exhibiting overly conservative behaviours and occasionally violating traffic laws. Existing solutions, such as runtime enforcement, mitigate this by automatically repairing the AV's planned trajectory at runtime, but such approaches lack transparency and should be a measure of last resort. It would be preferable for AV repairs to generalise beyond specific incidents and to be interpretable for users. In this work, we propose FixDrive, a framework that analyses driving records from near-misses or law violations to generate AV driving strategy repairs that reduce the chance of such incidents occurring again. These repairs are captured in {\mu}Drive, a high-level domain-specific language for specifying driving behaviours in response to event-based triggers. Implemented for the state-of-the-art autonomous driving system Apollo, FixDrive identifies and visualises critical moments from driving records, then uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with zero-shot learning to generate {\mu}Drive programs. We tested FixDrive on various benchmark scenarios, and found that the generated repairs improved the AV's performance with respect to following traffic laws, avoiding collisions, and successfully reaching destinations. Furthermore, the direct costs of repairing an AV -- 15 minutes of offline analysis and $0.08 per violation -- are reasonable in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> | None |

To address this issue, collaborative perception is envisioned to improve perceptual accuracy by using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to enable collaboration among connected and autonomous vehicles and roadside units. However, due to limited communication resources, it is impractical for all units to transmit sensing data such as point clouds or high-definition video. As a result, it is essential to optimize the scheduling of communication links to ensure efficient spectrum utilization for the exchange of perceptual data. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based V2X user scheduling algorithm for collaborative perception. Given the challenges in acquiring perceptual labels, we reformulate the conventional label-dependent objective into a label-free goal, based on characteristics of 3D object detection. Incorporating both channel state information (CSI) and semantic information, we develop a double deep Q-Network (DDQN)-based user scheduling framework for collaborative perception, named SchedCP. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of SchedCP compared with traditional V2X scheduling methods. Finally, we present a case study to illustrate how our proposed algorithm adaptively modifies the scheduling decisions by taking both instantaneous CSI and perceptual semantics into account.</p></details> |  | None |

While a considerable volume of literature focuses on densely scanned indoor scenarios, normal estimation during autonomous driving remains an intricate problem due to the sparse, non-uniform, and noisy nature of real-world LiDAR scans. In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal technique that leverages 3D point clouds and 2D colour images obtained from LiDAR and camera sensors for surface normal estimation. We present the Hybrid Geometric Transformer (HGT), a novel transformer-based neural network architecture that proficiently fuses visual semantic and 3D geometric information. Furthermore, we developed an effective learning strategy for the multi-modal data. Experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our information fusion approach compared to existing methods. It has also been verified that the proposed model can learn from a simulated 3D environment that mimics a traffic scene. The learned geometric knowledge is transferable and can be applied to real-world 3D scenes in the KITTI dataset. Further tasks built upon the estimated normal vectors in the KITTI dataset show that the proposed estimator has an advantage over existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditionally, these components have often been treated as separate modules, limiting the ability to perform interactive planning and leading to computational inefficiency in multi-agent scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel unified and data-driven framework that integrates prediction and planning with a single consistency model. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates samples from high-dimensional, multimodal joint trajectory distributions of the ego and multiple surrounding agents, enabling end-to-end predictive planning. It effectively produces interactive behaviors, such as proactive nudging and yielding to ensure both safe and efficient interactions with other road users. To incorporate additional planning constraints on the ego vehicle, we propose an alternating direction method for multi-objective guidance in online guided sampling. Compared to diffusion models, our consistency model achieves better performance with fewer sampling steps, making it more suitable for real-time deployment.

The proposed methods, termed Projected Zeroth-Order (P-ZO) dynamics, incorporate projection maps into a class of continuous-time model-free dynamics that make use of periodic dithering for the purpose of gradient learning. In particular, the proposed P-ZO algorithms can be interpreted as new extremum-seeking algorithms that autonomously drive an unknown system toward a neighborhood of the set of solutions of an optimization problem using only output feedback, while systematically guaranteeing that the input trajectories remain in a feasible set for all times. In this way, the P-ZO algorithms can properly handle hard and asymptotical constraints in model-free optimization problems without using penalty terms or barrier functions. Moreover, the proposed dynamics have suitable robustness properties with respect to small bounded additive disturbances on the states and dynamics, a property that is fundamental for practical real-world implementations. Additional tracking results for time-varying and switching cost functions are also derived under stronger convexity and smoothness assumptions and using tools from hybrid dynamical systems. Numerical examples are presented throughout the paper to illustrate the above results.</p></details> | 17 pages | None |

Previous end-to-end autonomous driving works represent both types of information in a single feature vector. However, including motion tasks, such as prediction and planning, always impairs detection and tracking performance, a phenomenon known as negative transfer in multi-task learning. To address this issue, we propose Neural-Bayes motion decoding, a novel parallel detection, tracking, and prediction method separating semantic and motion learning, similar to the Bayes filter. Specifically, we employ a set of learned motion queries that operate in parallel with the detection and tracking queries, sharing a unified set of recursively updated reference points. Moreover, we employ interactive semantic decoding to enhance information exchange in semantic tasks, promoting positive transfer. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show improvements of 5% in detection and 11% in tracking. Our method achieves state-of-the-art collision rates in open-loop planning evaluation without any modifications to the planning module.</p></details> |  | None |

The driving scene perception system fundamentally represents an object detection task that requires achieving a balance between accuracy and processing speed. Many contemporary methods focus on improving detection accuracy but often overlook the importance of real-time detection capabilities when computational resources are limited. Thus, it is vital to investigate efficient object detection strategies for driving scenes. This paper introduces Fast-COS, a novel single-stage object detection framework crafted specifically for driving scene applications. The research initiates with an analysis of the backbone, considering both macro and micro architectural designs, yielding the Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer (RAViT). RAViT utilizes Reparameterized Multi-Scale Depth-Wise Convolution (RepMSDW) and Reparameterized Self-Attention (RepSA) to enhance computational efficiency and feature extraction. In extensive tests across GPU, edge, and mobile platforms, RAViT achieves 81.4% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset, demonstrating significant throughput improvements over comparable backbone models such as ResNet, FastViT, RepViT, and EfficientFormer. Additionally, integrating RepMSDW into a feature pyramid network forms RepFPN, enabling fast and multi-scale feature fusion. Fast-COS enhances object detection in driving scenes, attaining an AP50 score of 57.2% on the BDD100K dataset and 80.0% on the TJU-DHD Traffic dataset. It surpasses leading models in efficiency, delivering up to 75.9% faster GPU inference and 1.38 higher throughput on edge devices compared to FCOS, YOLOF, and RetinaNet.

However, adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, snow, and more complex mixed degradation can significantly degrade image quality. The degradation compromises the accuracy and reliability of these systems across various scenarios. To tackle the challenge of developing adaptable models for scene restoration, we introduce the unified scene recovery network (USRNet), capable of handling multiple types of image degradation. The USRNet features a sophisticated architecture consisting of a scene encoder, an attention-driven node independent learning mechanism (NILM), an edge decoder, and a scene restoration module. The scene encoder, powered by advanced residual blocks, extracts deep features from degraded images in a progressive manner, ensuring thorough encoding of degradation information. To enhance the USRNet's adaptability in diverse weather conditions, we introduce NILM, which enables the network to learn and respond to different scenarios with precision, thereby increasing its robustness. The edge decoder is designed to extract edge features with precision, which is essential for maintaining image sharpness. Experimental results demonstrate that USRNet surpasses existing methods in handling complex imaging degradations, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of visual systems across diverse scenarios.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide an alternative computational model to process information and make decisions. This biologically plausible model has the advantage of low latency and energy efficiency. Recent work using SNNs for autonomous driving mostly focused on simple tasks like lane keeping in simplified simulation environments. This paper studies SNNs on photo-realistic driving scenes in the CARLA simulator, which is an important step toward using SNNs on real vehicles. The efficacy and generalizability of the method will be investigated.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, the availability of customer-level 360 cameras has made omnidirectional vision more popular, and the advance of deep learning (DL) has significantly sparked its research and applications.

Recent methods attempt to achieve this by learning a 3D occupancy world model that forecasts future surrounding scenes based on current observation. However, 3D occupancy labels are still required to produce promising results. Considering the high annotation cost for 3D outdoor scenes, we propose a semi-supervised vision-centric 3D occupancy world model, PreWorld, to leverage the potential of 2D labels through a novel two-stage training paradigm: the self-supervised pre-training stage and the fully-supervised fine-tuning stage. Specifically, during the pre-training stage, we utilize an attribute projection head to generate different attribute fields of a scene (e.g., RGB, density, semantic), thus enabling temporal supervision from 2D labels via volume rendering techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective state-conditioned forecasting module to recursively forecast future occupancy and ego trajectory in a direct manner. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method, and demonstrate that PreWorld achieves competitive performance across 3D occupancy prediction, 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07178v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -- the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep -- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |

Although integrating diffusion models with preference alignment strategies poses significant challenges for novices at this intersection, comprehensive and systematic reviews of this subject are still notably lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper extensively surveys preference alignment with diffusion models in image generation and editing. First, we systematically review cutting-edge optimization techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), and others, highlighting their pivotal role in aligning preferences with DMs. Then, we thoroughly explore the applications of aligning preferences with DMs in autonomous driving, medical imaging, robotics, and more. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the challenges of preference alignment with DMs. To our knowledge, this is the first survey centered on preference alignment with DMs, providing insights to drive future innovation in this dynamic area.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transfer Your Perspective: Controllable 3D Generation from Any Viewpoint in a Driving Scene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06682v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-driving cars relying solely on ego-centric perception face limitations in sensing, often failing to detect occluded, faraway objects. Collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) seems like a promising direction, but collecting data for development is non-trivial. It requires placing multiple sensor-equipped agents in a real-world driving scene, simultaneously! As such, existing datasets are limited in locations and agents. We introduce a novel surrogate to the rescue, which is to generate realistic perception from different viewpoints in a driving scene, conditioned on a real-world sample - the ego-car's sensory data. This surrogate has huge potential: it could potentially turn any ego-car dataset into a collaborative driving one to scale up the development of CAV. We present the very first solution, using a combination of simulated collaborative data and real ego-car data. Our method, Transfer Your Perspective (TYP), learns a conditioned diffusion model whose output samples are not only realistic but also consistent in both semantics and layouts with the given ego-car data. Empirical results demonstrate TYP's effectiveness in aiding in a CAV setting. In particular, TYP enables us to (pre-)train collaborative perception algorithms like early and late fusion with little or no real-world collaborative data, greatly facilitating downstream CAV applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This study presents the first Occupancy-based Large Language Model (Occ-LLM), which represents a pioneering effort to integrate LLMs with an important representation. To effectively encode occupancy as input for the LLM and address the category imbalances associated with occupancy, we propose Motion Separation Variational Autoencoder (MS-VAE). This innovative approach utilizes prior knowledge to distinguish dynamic objects from static scenes before inputting them into a tailored Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This separation enhances the model's capacity to concentrate on dynamic trajectories while effectively reconstructing static scenes. The efficacy of Occ-LLM has been validated across key tasks, including 4D occupancy forecasting, self-ego planning, and occupancy-based scene question answering. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Occ-LLM significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving gains of about 6\% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 4\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for the task of 4D occupancy forecasting. These findings highlight the transformative potential of Occ-LLM in reshaping current paradigms within robotic and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> | None |
| **[Occlusion-Aware Contingency Safety-Critical Planning for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06359v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safe driving while maintaining travel efficiency for autonomous vehicles in dynamic and occluded environments is a critical challenge. This paper proposes an occlusion-aware contingency safety-critical planning approach for real-time autonomous driving in such environments. Leveraging reachability analysis for risk assessment, forward reachable sets of occluded phantom vehicles are computed to quantify dynamic velocity boundaries. These velocity boundaries are incorporated into a biconvex nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation, enabling simultaneous optimization of exploration and fallback trajectories within a receding horizon planning framework. To facilitate real-time optimization and ensure coordination between trajectories, we employ the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the biconvex NLP problem into low-dimensional convex subproblems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulation studies and real-world experiments in occluded intersections. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced safety and improved travel efficiency, enabling real-time safe trajectory generation in dynamic occluded intersections under varying obstacle conditions.

| **[Actual Achieved Gain and Optimal Perceived Gain: Modeling Human Take-over Decisions Towards Automated Vehicles' Suggestions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06179v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driver decision quality in take-overs is critical for effective human-Autonomous Driving System (ADS) collaboration. However, current research lacks detailed analysis of its variations. This paper introduces two metrics--Actual Achieved Gain (AAG) and Optimal Perceived Gain (OPG)--to assess decision quality, with OPG representing optimal decisions and AAG reflecting actual outcomes. Both are calculated as weighted averages of perceived gains and losses, influenced by ADS accuracy. Study 1 (N=315) used a 21-point Thurstone scale to measure perceived gains and losses-key components of AAG and OPG-across typical tasks: route selection, overtaking, and collision avoidance. Studies 2 (N=54) and 3 (N=54) modeled decision quality under varying ADS accuracy and decision time. Results show with sufficient time (>3.5s), AAG converges towards OPG, indicating rational decision-making, while limited time leads to intuitive and deterministic choices. Study 3 also linked AAG-OPG deviations to irrational behaviors. An intervention study (N=8) and a pilot (N=4) employing voice alarms and multi-modal alarms based on these deviations demonstrated AAG's potential to improve decision quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Diffusion-Based Planning for Autonomous Driving with Flexible Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15564v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving human-like driving behaviors in complex open-world environments is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Contemporary learning-based planning approaches such as imitation learning methods often struggle to balance competing objectives and lack of safety assurance,due to limited adaptability and inadequacy in learning complex multi-modal behaviors commonly exhibited in human planning, not to mention their strong reliance on the fallback strategy with predefined rules. We propose a novel transformer-based Diffusion Planner for closed-loop planning, which can effectively model multi-modal driving behavior and ensure trajectory quality without any rule-based refinement. Our model supports joint modeling of both prediction and planning tasks under the same architecture, enabling cooperative behaviors between vehicles. Moreover, by learning the gradient of the trajectory score function and employing a flexible classifier guidance mechanism, Diffusion Planner effectively achieves safe and adaptable planning behaviors. Evaluations on the large-scale real-world autonomous planning benchmark nuPlan and our newly collected 200-hour delivery-vehicle driving dataset demonstrate that Diffusion Planner achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance with robust transferability in diverse driving styles.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SphereFusion: Efficient Panorama Depth Estimation via Gated Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05859v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the rapid development of panorama cameras, the task of estimating panorama depth has attracted significant attention from the computer vision community, especially in applications such as robot sensing and autonomous driving. However, existing methods relying on different projection formats often encounter challenges, either struggling with distortion and discontinuity in the case of equirectangular, cubemap, and tangent projections, or experiencing a loss of texture details with the spherical projection. To tackle these concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines the strengths of various projection methods. Specifically, SphereFusion initially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two distinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and spherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the spherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features for fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical domain. Meanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the efficiency of mesh operation. Extensive experiments on three public panorama datasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other state-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only 17 ms on a 512$\times$1024 panorama image.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 | None |
| **[TrackDiffuser: Nearly Model-Free Bayesian Filtering with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05629v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State estimation remains a fundamental challenge across numerous domains, from autonomous driving, aircraft tracking to quantum system control. Although Bayesian filtering has been the cornerstone solution, its classical model-based paradigm faces two major limitations: it struggles with inaccurate state space model (SSM) and requires extensive prior knowledge of noise characteristics. We present TrackDiffuser, a generative framework addressing both challenges by reformulating Bayesian filtering as a conditional diffusion model. Our approach implicitly learns system dynamics from data to mitigate the effects of inaccurate SSM, while simultaneously circumventing the need for explicit measurement models and noise priors by establishing a direct relationship between measurements and states. Through an implicit predict-and-update mechanism, TrackDiffuser preserves the interpretability advantage of traditional model-based filtering methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms both classical and contemporary hybrid methods, especially in challenging non-linear scenarios involving non-Gaussian noises. Notably, TrackDiffuser exhibits remarkable robustness to SSM inaccuracies, offering a practical solution for real-world state estimation problems where perfect models and prior knowledge are unavailable.</p></details> |  | None |

However, compared with single-vehicle perception, the openness of a CP system makes it more vulnerable to malicious attacks that can inject malicious information to mislead the perception of an ego vehicle, resulting in severe risks for safe driving. To mitigate such vulnerability, we first propose a new paradigm for malicious agent detection that effectively identifies malicious agents at the feature level without requiring verification of final perception results, significantly reducing computational overhead. Building on this paradigm, we introduce CP-GuardBench, the first comprehensive dataset provided to train and evaluate various malicious agent detection methods for CP systems. Furthermore, we develop a robust defense method called CP-Guard+, which enhances the margin between the representations of benign and malicious features through a carefully designed Dual-Centered Contrastive Loss (DCCLoss). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both CP-GuardBench and V2X-Sim, and demonstrate the superiority of CP-Guard+.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Learning-based Model Predictive Control Strategy for Drift Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04696v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drift vehicle control offers valuable insights to support safe autonomous driving in extreme conditions, which hinges on tracking a particular path while maintaining the vehicle states near the drift equilibrium points (DEP). However, conventional tracking methods are not adaptable for drift vehicles due to their opposite steering angle and yaw rate. In this paper, we propose an adaptive path tracking (APT) control method to dynamically adjust drift states to follow the reference path, improving the commonly utilized predictive path tracking methods with released computation burden. Furthermore, existing control strategies necessitate a precise system model to calculate the DEP, which can be more intractable due to the highly nonlinear drift dynamics and sensitive vehicle parameters. To tackle this problem, an adaptive learning-based model predictive control (ALMPC) strategy is proposed based on the APT method, where an upper-level Bayesian optimization is employed to learn the DEP and APT control law to instruct a lower-level MPC drift controller. This hierarchical system architecture can also resolve the inherent control conflict between path tracking and drifting by separating these objectives into different layers. The ALMPC strategy is verified on the Matlab-Carsim platform, and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in controlling the drift vehicle to follow a clothoid-based reference path even with the misidentified road friction parameter.</p></details> |  | None |

The Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC) has emerged as the foremost evaluation metric for assessing the performance of SC systems. In this work, we present a formal statistical formulation of population AURC, presenting an equivalent expression that can be interpreted as a reweighted risk function. Through Monte Carlo methods, we derive empirical AURC plug-in estimators for finite sample scenarios. The weight estimators associated with these plug-in estimators are shown to be consistent, with low bias and tightly bounded mean squared error (MSE). The plug-in estimators are proven to converge at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\ln(n)/n})$ demonstrating statistical consistency. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our estimators through experiments across multiple datasets, model architectures, and confidence score functions (CSFs), demonstrating consistency and effectiveness in fine-tuning AURC performance.</p></details> |  | None |
