One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model. Our framework, dataset, and model are available at https://github.com/ayesha-ishaq/DriveLMM-o1.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, github: https://github.com/ayesha-ishaq/DriveLMM-o1</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ayesha-ishaq/DriveLMM-o1) |
| **[OCCUQ: Exploring Efficient Uncertainty Quantification for 3D Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10605v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving has the potential to significantly enhance productivity and provide numerous societal benefits. Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training. Current methods often overlook uncertainties arising from adversarial conditions or distributional shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation under various camera corruption scenarios, such as fog or missing cameras, demonstrates that our approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty by assigning higher uncertainty values to unseen data. We introduce region-specific corruptions to simulate defects affecting only a single camera and validate our findings through both scene-level and region-level assessments. Our results show superior performance in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection and confidence calibration compared to common baselines such as Deep Ensembles and MC-Dropout. Our approach consistently demonstrates reliable uncertainty measures, indicating its potential for enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems in real-world scenarios.

| **[MuDG: Taming Multi-modal Diffusion with Gaussian Splatting for Urban Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10604v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in radiance fields have significantly advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS) in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, critical limitations persist: reconstruction-based methods exhibit substantial performance deterioration under significant viewpoint deviations from training trajectories, while generation-based techniques struggle with temporal coherence and precise scene controllability. To overcome these challenges, we present MuDG, an innovative framework that integrates Multi-modal Diffusion model with Gaussian Splatting (GS) for Urban Scene Reconstruction. MuDG leverages aggregated LiDAR point clouds with RGB and geometric priors to condition a multi-modal video diffusion model, synthesizing photorealistic RGB, depth, and semantic outputs for novel viewpoints. This synthesis pipeline enables feed-forward NVS without computationally intensive per-scene optimization, providing comprehensive supervision signals to refine 3DGS representations for rendering robustness enhancement under extreme viewpoint changes. Experiments on the Open Waymo Dataset demonstrate that MuDG outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction and synthesis quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unlock the Power of Unlabeled Data in Language Driving Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10586v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-based Large Language Models~(VisionLLMs) for autonomous driving have seen rapid advancements. However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 | None |
| **[Finetuning Generative Trajectory Model with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10434v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[SplatAD: Real-Time Lidar and Camera Rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16816v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, requires extensive testing across diverse driving scenarios. Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

| **[TARS: Traffic-Aware Radar Scene Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10210v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene flow provides crucial motion information for autonomous driving. Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel $\textbf{T}$raffic-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{R}$adar $\textbf{S}$cene flow estimation method, named $\textbf{TARS}$, which utilizes the motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. Therefrom, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space, enabling a holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[PCLA: A Framework for Testing Autonomous Agents in the CARLA Simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09385v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on testing autonomous driving agents has grown significantly, especially in simulation environments. The CARLA simulator is often the preferred choice, and the autonomous agents from the CARLA Leaderboard challenge are regarded as the best-performing agents within this environment. However, researchers who test these agents, rather than training their own ones from scratch, often face challenges in utilizing them within customized test environments and scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce PCLA (Pretrained CARLA Leaderboard Agents), an open-source Python testing framework that includes nine high-performing pre-trained autonomous agents from the Leaderboard challenges. PCLA is the first infrastructure specifically designed for testing various autonomous agents in arbitrary CARLA environments/scenarios. PCLA provides a simple way to deploy Leaderboard agents onto a vehicle without relying on the Leaderboard codebase, it allows researchers to easily switch between agents without requiring modifications to CARLA versions or programming environments, and it is fully compatible with the latest version of CARLA while remaining independent of the Leaderboard's specific CARLA version. PCLA is publicly accessible at https://github.com/MasoudJTehrani/PCLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be published at the FSE 2025 demonstration track</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/MasoudJTehrani/PCLA) |
| **[GS-SDF: LiDAR-Augmented Gaussian Splatting and Neural SDF for Geometrically Consistent Rendering and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10170v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital twins are fundamental to the development of autonomous driving and embodied artificial intelligence. However, achieving high-granularity surface reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering remains a challenge. Gaussian splatting offers efficient photorealistic rendering but struggles with geometric inconsistencies due to fragmented primitives and sparse observational data in robotics applications. Existing regularization methods, which rely on render-derived constraints, often fail in complex environments. Moreover, effectively integrating sparse LiDAR data with Gaussian splatting remains challenging. We propose a unified LiDAR-visual system that synergizes Gaussian splatting with a neural signed distance field. The accurate LiDAR point clouds enable a trained neural signed distance field to offer a manifold geometry field, This motivates us to offer an SDF-based Gaussian initialization for physically grounded primitive placement and a comprehensive geometric regularization for geometrically consistent rendering and reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate superior reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality across diverse trajectories. To benefit the community, the codes will be released at https://github.com/hku-mars/GS-SDF.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/hku-mars/GS-SDF) |
| **[Unlocking Generalization Power in LiDAR Point Cloud Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10149v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world environments, a LiDAR point cloud registration method with robust generalization capabilities (across varying distances and datasets) is crucial for ensuring safety in autonomous driving and other LiDAR-based applications. However, current methods fall short in achieving this level of generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UGP, a pruned framework designed to enhance generalization power for LiDAR point cloud registration. The core insight in UGP is the elimination of cross-attention mechanisms to improve generalization, allowing the network to concentrate on intra-frame feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a progressive self-attention module to reduce ambiguity in large-scale scenes and integrate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features to incorporate semantic information about scene elements. Together, these enhancements significantly boost the network's generalization performance. We validated our approach through various generalization experiments in multiple outdoor scenes. In cross-distance generalization experiments on KITTI and nuScenes, UGP achieved state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall rates of 94.5% and 91.4%, respectively. In cross-dataset generalization from nuScenes to KITTI, UGP achieved a state-of-the-art mean Registration Recall of 90.9%.

| **[Can't Slow me Down: Learning Robust and Hardware-Adaptive Object Detectors against Latency Attacks for Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02171v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection is a fundamental enabler for many real-time downstream applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality and supply chain management. However, the algorithmic backbone of neural networks is brittle to imperceptible perturbations in the system inputs, which were generally known as misclassifying attacks. By targeting the real-time processing capability, a new class of latency attacks are reported recently. They exploit new attack surfaces in object detectors by creating a computational bottleneck in the post-processing module, that leads to cascading failure and puts the real-time downstream tasks at risks. In this work, we take an initial attempt to defend against this attack via background-attentive adversarial training that is also cognizant of the underlying hardware capabilities. We first draw system-level connections between latency attack and hardware capacity across heterogeneous GPU devices. Based on the particular adversarial behaviors, we utilize objectness loss as a proxy and build background attention into the adversarial training pipeline, and achieve a reasonable balance between clean and robust accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the defense effectiveness of restoring real-time processing capability from $13$ FPS to $43$ FPS on Jetson Orin NX, with a better trade-off between the clean and robust accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mamba-VA: A Mamba-based Approach for Continuous Emotion Recognition in Valence-Arousal Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10104v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Emotion Recognition (CER) plays a crucial role in intelligent human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and autonomous driving. Emotion modeling based on the Valence-Arousal (VA) space enables a more nuanced representation of emotional states. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling long-term dependencies and capturing complex temporal dynamics. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel emotion recognition model, Mamba-VA, which leverages the Mamba architecture to efficiently model sequential emotional variations in video frames. First, the model employs a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to extract deep visual features from video frames, enhancing the robustness of temporal information. Then, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is utilized for temporal modeling to capture local temporal dependencies. Subsequently, Mamba is applied for long-sequence modeling, enabling the learning of global emotional trends. Finally, a fully connected (FC) layer performs regression analysis to predict continuous valence and arousal values. Experimental results on the Valence-Arousal (VA) Estimation task of the 8th competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves valence and arousal scores of 0.5362 (0.5036) and 0.4310 (0.4119) on the validation (test) set, respectively, outperforming the baseline.

| **[JiSAM: Alleviate Labeling Burden and Corner Case Problems in Autonomous Driving via Minimal Real-World Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08422v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep-learning-based autonomous driving (AD) perception introduces a promising picture for safe and environment-friendly transportation. However, the over-reliance on real labeled data in LiDAR perception limits the scale of on-road attempts. 3D real world data is notoriously time-and-energy-consuming to annotate and lacks corner cases like rare traffic participants. On the contrary, in simulators like CARLA, generating labeled LiDAR point clouds with corner cases is a piece of cake. However, introducing synthetic point clouds to improve real perception is non-trivial. This stems from two challenges: 1) sample efficiency of simulation datasets 2) simulation-to-real gaps. To overcome both challenges, we propose a plug-and-play method called JiSAM , shorthand for Jittering augmentation, domain-aware backbone and memory-based Sectorized AlignMent. In extensive experiments conducted on the famous AD dataset NuScenes, we demonstrate that, with SOTA 3D object detector, JiSAM is able to utilize the simulation data and only labels on 2.5% available real data to achieve comparable performance to models trained on all real data. Additionally, JiSAM achieves more than 15 mAPs on the objects not labeled in the real training set. We will release models and codes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GraphBEV: Towards Robust BEV Feature Alignment for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11848v4)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating LiDAR and camera information into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation has emerged as a crucial aspect of 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, existing methods are susceptible to the inaccurate calibration relationship between LiDAR and the camera sensor. Such inaccuracies result in errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, ultimately causing misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a robust fusion framework called Graph BEV. Addressing errors caused by inaccurate point cloud projection, we introduce a Local Align module that employs neighbor-aware depth features via Graph matching. Additionally, we propose a Global Align module to rectify the misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. Our Graph BEV framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP of 70.1\%, surpassing BEV Fusion by 1.6\% on the nuscenes validation set. Importantly, our Graph BEV outperforms BEV Fusion by 8.3\% under conditions with misalignment noise.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TGP: Two-modal occupancy prediction with 3D Gaussian and sparse points for 3D Environment Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09941v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic occupancy has rapidly become a research focus in the fields of robotics and autonomous driving environment perception due to its ability to provide more realistic geometric perception and its closer integration with downstream tasks. By performing occupancy prediction of the 3D space in the environment, the ability and robustness of scene understanding can be effectively improved. However, existing occupancy prediction tasks are primarily modeled using voxel or point cloud-based approaches: voxel-based network structures often suffer from the loss of spatial information due to the voxelization process, while point cloud-based methods, although better at retaining spatial location information, face limitations in representing volumetric structural details. To address this issue, we propose a dual-modal prediction method based on 3D Gaussian sets and sparse points, which balances both spatial location and volumetric structural information, achieving higher accuracy in semantic occupancy prediction. Specifically, our method adopts a Transformer-based architecture, taking 3D Gaussian sets, sparse points, and queries as inputs. Through the multi-layer structure of the Transformer, the enhanced queries and 3D Gaussian sets jointly contribute to the semantic occupancy prediction, and an adaptive fusion mechanism integrates the semantic outputs of both modalities to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, to further improve accuracy, we dynamically refine the point cloud at each layer, allowing for more precise location information during occupancy prediction. We conducted experiments on the Occ3DnuScenes dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method on IoU based metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Planning with Adaptive World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10714v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning is crucial for safe navigation in complex urban environments. Historically, motion planners (MPs) have been evaluated with procedurally-generated simulators like CARLA. However, such synthetic benchmarks do not capture real-world multi-agent interactions. nuPlan, a recently released MP benchmark, addresses this limitation by augmenting real-world driving logs with closed-loop simulation logic, effectively turning the fixed dataset into a reactive simulator. We analyze the characteristics of nuPlan's recorded logs and find that each city has its own unique driving behaviors, suggesting that robust planners must adapt to different environments. We learn to model such unique behaviors with BehaviorNet, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that predicts reactive agent behaviors using features derived from recently-observed agent histories; intuitively, some aggressive agents may tailgate lead vehicles, while others may not. To model such phenomena, BehaviorNet predicts the parameters of an agent's motion controller rather than directly predicting its spacetime trajectory (as most forecasters do). Finally, we present AdaptiveDriver, a model-predictive control (MPC) based planner that unrolls different world models conditioned on BehaviorNet's predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaptiveDriver achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuPlan closed-loop planning benchmark, improving over prior work by 2% on Test-14 Hard R-CLS, and generalizes even when evaluated on never-before-seen cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project has been accepted to the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025.

| **[CleverDistiller: Simple and Spatially Consistent Cross-modal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09878v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINO have led to a paradigm shift in 2D camera-based perception towards extracting generalized features to support many downstream tasks. Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comprehensive Multi-Vocal Empirical Study of ML Cloud Service Misuses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09815v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used across various domains, including medical diagnostics and autonomous driving. To support this growth, cloud providers offer ML services to ease the integration of ML components in software systems. The evolving business requirements and the popularity of ML services have led practitioners of all skill levels to implement, and maintain ML service-based systems. However, they may not always adhere to optimal design and usage practices for ML cloud services, resulting in common misuse which could significantly degrade the quality of ML service-based systems and adversely affect their maintenance and evolution. Though much research has been conducted on ML service misuse, a consistent terminology and specification for these misuses remain absent. We therefore conduct in this paper a comprehensive, multi-vocal empirical study exploring the prevalence of ML cloud service misuses in practice. We propose a catalog of 20 ML cloud service misuses, most of which have not been studied in prior research. To achieve this, we conducted a) a systematic literature review of studies on ML misuses, b) a gray literature review of the official documentation provided by major cloud providers, c) an empirical analysis of a curated set of 377 ML service-based systems on GitHub, and d) a survey with 50 ML practitioners. Our results show that ML service misuses are common in both open-source projects and industry, often stemming from a lack of understanding of service capabilities, and insufficient documentation. This emphasizes the importance of ongoing education in best practices for ML services, which is the focus of this paper, while also highlighting the need for tools to automatically detect and refactor ML misuses.</p></details> |  | None |

To evaluate the utility and limitations of synthetic data, we conducted controlled experiments using multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset generated by BIT Technology Solutions GmbH. Our study spans two sensor modalities, camera and LiDAR, and investigates both 2D and 3D object detection tasks. We compare models trained on real, synthetic, and mixed datasets, analyzing their robustness and generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that the use of a combination of real and synthetic data improves the robustness and generalization of object detection models, underscoring the potential of synthetic data in advancing autonomous driving technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often focus on either driving or vision-language understanding but achieving both high driving performance and extensive language understanding remains challenging. In addition, the dominant approach to tackle vision-language understanding is using visual question answering. However, for autonomous driving, this is only useful if it is aligned with the action space. Otherwise, the model's answers could be inconsistent with its behavior. Therefore, we propose a model that can handle three different tasks: (1) closed-loop driving, (2) vision-language understanding, and (3) language-action alignment. Our model SimLingo is based on a vision language model (VLM) and works using only camera, excluding expensive sensors like LiDAR. SimLingo obtains state-of-the-art performance on the widely used CARLA simulator on the Bench2Drive benchmark and is the winning entry at the CARLA challenge 2024. Additionally, we achieve strong results in a wide variety of language-related tasks while maintaining high driving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025. 1st Place @ CARLA Challenge 2024.

| **[HERMES: A Unified Self-Driving World Model for Simultaneous 3D Scene Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14729v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving World Models (DWMs) have become essential for autonomous driving by enabling future scene prediction. However, existing DWMs are limited to scene generation and fail to incorporate scene understanding, which involves interpreting and reasoning about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a unified Driving World Model named HERMES. We seamlessly integrate 3D scene understanding and future scene evolution (generation) through a unified framework in driving scenarios. Specifically, HERMES leverages a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation to consolidate multi-view spatial information while preserving geometric relationships and interactions. We also introduce world queries, which incorporate world knowledge into BEV features via causal attention in the Large Language Model, enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks.

However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches predominantly depend on single-vehicle data collection for model training and optimization, resulting in significant challenges such as high data acquisition and annotation costs, the scarcity of critical driving scenarios, and fragmented datasets that impede model generalization. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce RS2V-L, a novel framework for reconstructing and synthesizing vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor observations. Specifically, our method transforms roadside LiDAR point clouds into the vehicle-mounted LiDAR coordinate system by leveraging the target vehicle's relative pose. Subsequently, high-fidelity vehicle-mounted LiDAR data is synthesized through virtual LiDAR modeling, point cloud classification, and resampling techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to reconstruct vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the generated data into model training-complementing the KITTI dataset-enhances 3D object detection accuracy by over \text{30\%} while improving the efficiency of end-to-end autonomous driving data generation by more than an order of magnitude. These findings strongly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and underscore its potential in reducing dependence on costly vehicle-mounted data collection while improving the robustness of autonomous driving models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon self-examination, we have found that the data in the experimental section of our paper is uncertain.

| **[Object-Centric World Model for Language-Guided Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06170v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

It is difficult for humans to manually review concurrent behaviors or to write test cases covering all possible executions, often resulting in critical bugs. Preemption in schedulers serves as a typical example. This paper proposes a development method for concurrent software, such as schedulers. Our method incorporates model checking as an aid for tracing code, simplifying the analysis of concurrent behavior; we refer to this as model checking-assisted code review. While this approach aids in tracing behaviors, the accuracy of the results is limited because of the semantics gap between the modeling language and the programming language. Therefore, we also introduce runtime verification to address this limitation in model checking-assisted code review. We applied our approach to a real-world operating system, Awkernel, as a case study. This new operating system, currently under development for autonomous driving, is designed for preemptive task execution using asynchronous functions in Rust. After implementing our method, we identified several bugs that are difficult to detect through manual reviews or simple tests.</p></details> |  | None |

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving \textbf{W}orld \textbf{M}odel named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying \textbf{E}go-\textbf{O}ther vehicle \textbf{T}rajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30\% in FID and 55\% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures | None |

These inconsistencies pose significant challenges to the stability and reliability of real-world autonomous driving and map data collection systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end tracking framework for global map construction by temporally tracking map elements' historical trajectories. Firstly, instance-level historical rasterization map representation is designed to explicitly store previous perception results, which can control and maintain different global instances' history information in a fine-grained way. Secondly, we introduce a Map-Trajectory Prior Fusion module within this tracking framework, leveraging historical priors for tracked instances to improve temporal smoothness and continuity. Thirdly, we propose a global perspective metric to evaluate the quality of temporal geometry construction in HD maps, filling the gap in current metrics for assessing global geometric perception results. Substantial experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both single-frame and temporal metrics.

However, such methods are limited by the excessive compression of multi-modal features. While some works explore feature fusion in dense voxel spaces, they suffer from high computational costs and inefficiencies in query generation. To address these limitations, we propose a Dual-Domain Homogeneous Fusion network (DDHFusion), which leverages the complementary advantages of both BEV and voxel domains while mitigating their respective drawbacks. Specifically, we first transform image features into BEV and sparse voxel spaces using LSS and our proposed semantic-aware feature sampling module which can significantly reduces computational overhead by filtering unimportant voxels. For feature encoding, we design two networks for BEV and voxel feature fusion, incorporating novel cross-modal voxel and BEV Mamba blocks to resolve feature misalignment and enable efficient yet comprehensive scene perception. The output voxel features are injected into the BEV space to compensate for the loss of 3D details caused by height compression. For feature decoding, a progressive query generation module is implemented in the BEV domain to alleviate false negatives during query selection caused by feature compression and small object sizes. Finally, a progressive decoder can sequentially aggregate not only context-rich BEV features but also geometry-aware voxel features, ensuring more precise confidence prediction and bounding box regression. On the NuScenes dataset, DDHfusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, and further experiments demonstrate its superiority over other homogeneous fusion methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement. We present both, qualitative and quantitative results where we compare our generated cyclists against those from a recent stable diffusion-based method.</p></details> |  | None |

As Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) continue to expand, ground vehicles (GVs) face the challenge of handling huge amounts of sensor data to drive safely. Specifically, due to energy and capacity limitations, GVs will need to offload resource-hungry tasks to external (cloud) computing units for faster processing. In 6th generation (6G) wireless systems, the research community is exploring the concept of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), where satellites can serve as space edge computing nodes to aggregate, store, and process data from GVs. In this paper we propose new data offloading strategies between a cluster of GVs and satellites in the Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), to optimize the trade-off between coverage and end-to-end delay. For the accuracy of the simulations, we consider real data and orbits from the Starlink constellation, one of the most representative and popular examples of commercial satellite deployments for communication. Our results demonstrate that Starlink satellites can support real-time offloading under certain conditions that depend on the onboard computational capacity of the satellites, the frame rate of the sensors, and the number of GVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

| **[Simulator Ensembles for Trustworthy Autonomous Driving Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08936v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing with driving simulators is extensively used to identify failing conditions of automated driving assistance systems (ADAS) and reduce the amount of in-field road testing. However, existing studies have shown that repeated test execution in the same as well as in distinct simulators can yield different outcomes, which can be attributed to sources of flakiness or different implementations of the physics, among other factors. In this paper, we present MultiSim, a novel approach to multi-simulation ADAS testing based on a search-based testing approach that leverages an ensemble of simulators to identify failure-inducing, simulator-agnostic test scenarios. During the search, each scenario is evaluated jointly on multiple simulators. Scenarios that produce consistent results across simulators are prioritized for further exploration, while those that fail on only a subset of simulators are given less priority, as they may reflect simulator-specific issues rather than generalizable failures. Our case study, which involves testing a deep neural network-based ADAS on different pairs of three widely used simulators, demonstrates that MultiSim outperforms single-simulator testing by achieving on average a higher rate of simulator-agnostic failures by 51%. Compared to a state-of-the-art multi-simulator approach that combines the outcome of independent test generation campaigns obtained in different simulators, MultiSim identifies 54% more simulator-agnostic failing tests while showing a comparable validity rate. An enhancement of MultiSim that leverages surrogate models to predict simulator disagreements and bypass executions does not only increase the average number of valid failures but also improves efficiency in finding the first valid failure.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering advanced techniques for compressing point clouds more efficiently than conventional coding methods while also allowing effective computer vision tasks performed in the compressed domain thus, for the first time, making available a common compressed visual representation effective for both man and machine. Taking advantage of this potential, JPEG has recently finalized the JPEG Pleno Learning-based Point Cloud Coding (PCC) standard offering efficient lossy coding of static point clouds, targeting both human visualization and machine processing by leveraging deep learning models for geometry and color coding. The geometry is processed directly in its original 3D form using sparse convolutional neural networks, while the color data is projected onto 2D images and encoded using the also learning-based JPEG AI standard. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete technical description of the JPEG PCC standard, along with a thorough benchmarking of its performance against the state-of-the-art, while highlighting its main strengths and weaknesses. In terms of compression performance, JPEG PCC outperforms the conventional MPEG PCC standards, especially in geometry coding, achieving significant rate reductions. Color compression performance is less competitive but this is overcome by the power of a full learning-based coding framework for both geometry and color and the associated effective compressed domain processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 12 figures, accepted in IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

However, traditional cooperative methods are constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 11% higher success rate across diverse highly interactive V2V driving scenarios.

Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

The potential of leveraging planning in query design and interaction has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we introduce a multi-granularity planning query representation that integrates heterogeneous waypoints, including spatial, temporal, and driving-style waypoints across various sampling patterns. It provides additional supervision for trajectory prediction, enhancing precise closed-loop control for the ego vehicle. Additionally, we explicitly utilize the geometric properties of planning trajectories to effectively retrieve relevant image features based on physical locations using deformable attention. By combining these strategies, we propose a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework, termed HiP-AD, which simultaneously performs perception, prediction, and planning within a unified decoder. HiP-AD enables comprehensive interaction by allowing planning queries to iteratively interact with perception queries in the BEV space while dynamically extracting image features from perspective views.

This is caused by the lack of large-scale annotated datasets on the one hand, and lack of methods that can robustly handle the sparse and often noisy LiDAR data in a reasonable time on the other hand. We address these limitations using a traffic simulation engine and present LiSu, the first large-scale, synthetic LiDAR point cloud dataset with ground truth surface normal annotations, eliminating the need for tedious manual labeling. Additionally, we propose a novel method that exploits the spatiotemporal characteristics of autonomous driving data to enhance surface normal estimation accuracy. By incorporating two regularization terms, we enforce spatial consistency among neighboring points and temporal smoothness across consecutive LiDAR frames. These regularizers are particularly effective in self-training settings, where they mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust real-world deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LiSu, achieving state-of-the-art performance in LiDAR surface normal estimation.

Algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) strategies, designed atop standard chip architectures, are both cost-effective and adaptable to different architectures, making them particularly attractive. However, traditional ABFT relies on precise error metrics, triggering error recovery procedures even for minor computational deviations. These minor errors often do not impact the accuracy of the neural network model due to the inherent fault tolerance. To address this inefficiency, we propose an approximate ABFT approach, called ApproxABFT, which initiates error recovery only when computational errors are significant. This approach avoids unnecessary recovery procedures, streamlines the error recovery process, and focuses on correcting impactful errors, ultimately enhancing recovery quality. Additionally, ApproxABFT incorporates a fine-grained blocking strategy to smooth error sensitivity across layers within neural network models. Experimental results demonstrate that ApproxABFT reduces the computing overhead by 67.83\% and improves the tolerable bit error rate by an order of magnitude on average compared to classical accurate ABFT.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, despite the strong performance of PETR-based methods in 3D perception benchmarks, their direct INT8 quantization for onboard deployment leads to drastic accuracy drops-up to 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. In this work, we propose Q-PETR, a quantization-aware position embedding transformation that re-engineers key components of the PETR framework to reconcile the discrepancy between the dynamic ranges of positional encodings and image features, and to adapt the cross-attention mechanism for low-bit inference. By redesigning the positional encoding module and introducing an adaptive quantization strategy, Q-PETR maintains floating-point performance with a performance degradation of less than 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Moreover, compared to its FP32 counterpart, Q-PETR achieves a two-fold speedup and reduces memory usage by three times, thereby offering a deployment-friendly solution for resource-constrained onboard devices. Extensive experiments across various PETR-series models validate the strong generalization and practical benefits of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.

| **[UniScene: Unified Occupancy-centric Driving Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05435v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-fidelity, controllable, and annotated training data is critical for autonomous driving. Existing methods typically generate a single data form directly from a coarse scene layout, which not only fails to output rich data forms required for diverse downstream tasks but also struggles to model the direct layout-to-data distribution. In this paper, we introduce UniScene, the first unified framework for generating three key data forms - semantic occupancy, video, and LiDAR - in driving scenes. UniScene employs a progressive generation process that decomposes the complex task of scene generation into two hierarchical steps: (a) first generating semantic occupancy from a customized scene layout as a meta scene representation rich in both semantic and geometric information, and then (b) conditioned on occupancy, generating video and LiDAR data, respectively, with two novel transfer strategies of Gaussian-based Joint Rendering and Prior-guided Sparse Modeling. This occupancy-centric approach reduces the generation burden, especially for intricate scenes, while providing detailed intermediate representations for the subsequent generation stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniScene outperforms previous SOTAs in the occupancy, video, and LiDAR generation, which also indeed benefits downstream driving tasks.

| **[Talk2PC: Enhancing 3D Visual Grounding through LiDAR and Radar Point Clouds Fusion for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08336v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied outdoor scene understanding forms the foundation for autonomous agents to perceive, analyze, and react to dynamic driving environments. However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), collecting and processing limited scene-aware contexts. Instead, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors like LiDAR offer rich depth information and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Meanwhile, the emerging 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is capable of detecting the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. Therefore, the integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, enabling more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, in this paper, we exploratively propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar contexts. To adaptively balance the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we have designed a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds dual-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Additionally, we have designed a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we innovatively devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge. Our experiments have demonstrated that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures | None |

Neural rendering techniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic environments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based approaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera and LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling. Conversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for scene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization. However, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model non-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to sensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified representation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for rendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data rendering. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This work presents a unified and efficient solution for realistic simulation of camera and LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, offering significant advancements in both rendering quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

While end-to-end models trained on large datasets perform well in standard driving scenarios, they struggle with complex low-frequency events. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) advancements offer enhanced reasoning but suffer from computational inefficiency. Inspired by the dual-process cognitive model "Thinking, Fast and Slow", we propose $\textbf{FASIONAD}$ -- a novel dual-system framework that synergizes a fast end-to-end planner with a VLM-based reasoning module. The fast system leverages end-to-end learning to achieve real-time trajectory generation in common scenarios, while the slow system activates through uncertainty estimation to perform contextual analysis and complex scenario resolution. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A dynamic switching mechanism enabling slow system intervention based on real-time uncertainty assessment; (2) An information bottleneck with high-level plan feedback that optimizes the slow system's guidance capability; (3) A bidirectional knowledge exchange where visual prompts enhance the slow system's reasoning while its feedback refines the fast planner's decision-making. To strengthen VLM reasoning, we develop a question-answering mechanism coupled with reward-instruct training strategy. In open-loop experiments, FASIONAD achieves a $6.7\%$ reduction in average $L2$ trajectory error and $28.1\%$ lower collision rate.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, the lack of quality datasets hinders research and development. We report a new method that is able to simulate 4D millimeter wave radar signals including pitch, yaw, range, and Doppler velocity along with radar signal strength (RSS) using camera image, light detection and ranging (lidar) point cloud, and ego-velocity. The method is based on two new neural networks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of radar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on appearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method using open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The experimental results show that our method can successfully generate high-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object detection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar. The network outperforms the counterpart trained only on raw radar data, a promising result to facilitate future radar-based research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one task and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks, achieving a 10.7% improvement in challenging rare perception scenarios and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

A powerful autonomous driving system should be capable of handling images under all conditions, including nighttime. Generating accurate and diverse nighttime semantic segmentation datasets is crucial for enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms in low-light conditions. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach named NPSim, which enables the simulation of realistic nighttime images from real daytime counterparts with monocular inverse rendering and ray tracing. NPSim comprises two key components: mesh reconstruction and relighting. The mesh reconstruction component generates an accurate representation of the scene structure by combining geometric information extracted from the input RGB image and semantic information from its corresponding semantic labels. The relighting component integrates real-world nighttime light sources and material characteristics to simulate the complex interplay of light and object surfaces under low-light conditions. The scope of this thesis mainly focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the mesh reconstruction component. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh reconstruction component in producing high-quality scene meshes and their generality across different autonomous driving datasets. We also propose a detailed experiment plan for evaluating the entire pipeline, including both quantitative metrics in training state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches and human perceptual studies, aiming to indicate the capability of our approach to generate realistic nighttime images and the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

In autonomous driving, recent end-to-end models have greatly improved planning performance but still struggle with long-tailed problems due to limited common sense and reasoning abilities. Some studies integrate vision-language models (VLMs) into autonomous driving, but they typically rely on pre-trained models with simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on driving data, without further exploration of training strategies or optimizations specifically tailored for planning. In this paper, we propose AlphaDrive, a RL and reasoning framework for VLMs in autonomous driving. AlphaDrive introduces four GRPO-based RL rewards tailored for planning and employs a two-stage planning reasoning training strategy that combines SFT with RL. As a result, AlphaDrive significantly improves both planning performance and training efficiency compared to using only SFT or without reasoning. Moreover, we are also excited to discover that, following RL training, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities, which is critical for improving driving safety and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, AlphaDrive is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with planning reasoning into autonomous driving.

To study this, we create the Robusto-1 dataset that uses dashcam video data from Peru, a country with one of the worst (aggressive) drivers in the world, a high traffic index, and a high ratio of bizarre to non-bizarre street objects likely never seen in training. In particular, to preliminarly test at a cognitive level how well Foundational Visual Language Models (VLMs) compare to Humans in Driving, we move away from bounding boxes, segmentation maps, occupancy maps or trajectory estimation to multi-modal Visual Question Answering (VQA) comparing both humans and machines through a popular method in systems neuroscience known as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Depending on the type of questions we ask and the answers these systems give, we will show in what cases do VLMs and Humans converge or diverge allowing us to probe on their cognitive alignment. We find that the degree of alignment varies significantly depending on the type of questions asked to each type of system (Humans vs VLMs), highlighting a gap in their alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A pre-print. 26 pages.

This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it is possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we introduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models (VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual prompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of both financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for robotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene understanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs, making them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we propose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named Chameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over detected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a VLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages the strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while maintaining high performance.

One often overlooked aspect is the uncertainty of planned trajectories predicted by these systems, despite awareness of their own uncertainty being key to achieve safety and robustness. We propose to estimate this uncertainty by adapting loss prediction from the uncertainty quantification literature. To this end, we introduce a novel light-weight module, dubbed CATPlan, that is trained to decode motion and planning embeddings into estimates of the collision loss used to partially supervise end-to-end AD systems. During inference, these estimates are interpreted as collision risk. We evaluate CATPlan on the safety-critical, nerf-based, closed-loop benchmark NeuroNCAP and find that it manages to detect collisions with a $54.8\%$ relative improvement to average precision over a GMM-based baseline in which the predicted trajectory is compared to the forecasted trajectories of other road users. Our findings indicate that the addition of CATPlan can lead to safer end-to-end AD systems and hope that our work will spark increased interest in uncertainty quantification for such systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the 3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes. Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving 1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to 36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.</p></details> |  | None |

However, there still exist fundamental challenges: deeply coupled fusion methods assume continuous sensor availability, making them vulnerable to sensor degradation and failure, whereas sensor-wise cross-attention fusion methods struggle with computational cost and unified feature representation. This paper presents availability-aware sensor fusion (ASF), a novel method that employs unified canonical projection (UCP) to enable consistency in all sensor features for fusion and cross-attention across sensors along patches (CASAP) to enhance robustness of sensor fusion against sensor degradation and failure. As a result, the proposed ASF shows a superior object detection performance to the existing state-of-the-art fusion methods under various weather and sensor degradation (or failure) conditions; Extensive experiments on the K-Radar dataset demonstrate that ASF achieves improvements of 9.7% in AP BEV (87.2%) and 20.1% in AP 3D (73.6%) in object detection at IoU=0.5, while requiring a low computational cost.

Current protocols typically respond with immediate stops or minimal-risk maneuvers, worsening traffic flow and lacking flexibility for rare driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents. To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous driving resilience against adverse perception deficits.

Aerial-ground cooperation offers a promising solution by integrating UAVs' aerial views with ground vehicles' local observations. However, progress in this emerging field has been hindered by the absence of public datasets and standardized evaluation benchmarks. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive solution for aerial-ground cooperative 3D perception through three key contributions: (1) Griffin, a large-scale multi-modal dataset featuring over 200 dynamic scenes (30k+ frames) with varied UAV altitudes (20-60m), diverse weather conditions, and occlusion-aware 3D annotations, enhanced by CARLA-AirSim co-simulation for realistic UAV dynamics; (2) A unified benchmarking framework for aerial-ground cooperative detection and tracking tasks, including protocols for evaluating communication efficiency, latency tolerance, and altitude adaptability; (3) AGILE, an instance-level intermediate fusion baseline that dynamically aligns cross-view features through query-based interaction, achieving an advantageous balance between communication overhead and perception accuracy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of aerial-ground cooperative perception and demonstrate the direction of further research.

However, real-world applications demand more than visually plausible predictions; they require reasoning about object motions based on explicitly defined boundary conditions, such as initial scene image and partial object motion. We term this capability Boundary Conditional Motion Reasoning. Current approaches either neglect explicit user-defined motion constraints, producing physically inconsistent motions, or conversely demand complete motion inputs, which are rarely available in practice. Here we introduce Motion Dreamer, a two-stage framework that explicitly separates motion reasoning from visual synthesis, addressing these limitations. Our approach introduces instance flow, a sparse-to-dense motion representation enabling effective integration of partial user-defined motions, and the motion inpainting strategy to robustly enable reasoning motions of other objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion Dreamer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior motion plausibility and visual realism, thus bridging the gap towards practical boundary conditional motion reasoning.

Our proposed framework, termed the "World-Centric Diffusion Transformer"(WcDT), optimizes the entire trajectory generation process, from feature extraction to model inference. To enhance the scene diversity and stochasticity, the historical trajectory data is first preprocessed into "Agent Move Statement" and encoded into latent space using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) enhanced with Diffusion with Transformer (DiT) blocks. Then, the latent features, historical trajectories, HD map features, and historical traffic signal information are fused with various transformer-based encoders that are used to enhance the interaction of agents with other elements in the traffic scene. The encoded traffic scenes are then decoded by a trajectory decoder to generate multimodal future trajectories. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach exhibits superior performance in generating both realistic and diverse trajectories, showing its potential for integration into automatic driving simulation systems.

BEV mapping models need to be applied to the unlabeled real world, making the study of unsupervised domain adaptation models an essential path. However, research on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and cannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this paper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation framework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that solely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper explores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct levels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists of three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision (SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum Mixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective feature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation models in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by spatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an intermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels, thereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding perspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of view frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which guides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV labels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as BEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping.

When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments.

However, the complex and highly dynamic nature of traffic environments presents significant challenges in accurately rendering these scenes. In this paper, we introduce a novel 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach, which incorporates context and temporal deformation awareness to improve dynamic scene rendering. Specifically, we employ a 2D semantic segmentation foundation model to self-supervise the 4D semantic features of Gaussians, ensuring meaningful contextual embedding. Simultaneously, we track the temporal deformation of each Gaussian across adjacent frames. By aggregating and encoding both semantic and temporal deformation features, each Gaussian is equipped with cues for potential deformation compensation within 3D space, facilitating a more precise representation of dynamic scenes. Experimental results show that our method improves 4DGS's ability to capture fine details in dynamic scene rendering for autonomous driving and outperforms other self-supervised methods in 4D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, CoDa-4DGS deforms semantic features with each Gaussian, enabling broader applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing world models often suffer from low prediction fidelity and compounding one-step errors, leading to policy degradation over long horizons. Additionally, traditional RL policies, often deterministic or single Gaussian-based, fail to capture the multi-modal nature of decision-making in complex driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Imagine-2-Drive, a novel WMRL framework that integrates a high-fidelity world model with a multi-modal diffusion-based policy actor. It consists of two key components: DiffDreamer, a diffusion-based world model that generates future observations simultaneously, mitigating error accumulation, and DPA (Diffusion Policy Actor), a diffusion-based policy that models diverse and multi-modal trajectory distributions. By training DPA within DiffDreamer, our method enables robust policy learning with minimal online interactions. We evaluate our method in CARLA using standard driving benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms prior world model baselines, improving Route Completion and Success Rate by 15% and 20% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

We introduce PixelSHAP, a model-agnostic framework extending Shapley-based analysis to structured visual entities. Unlike previous methods focusing on text prompts, PixelSHAP applies to vision-based reasoning by systematically perturbing image objects and quantifying their influence on a VLM's response. PixelSHAP requires no model internals, operating solely on input-output pairs, making it compatible with open-source and commercial models. It supports diverse embedding-based similarity metrics and scales efficiently using optimization techniques inspired by Shapley-based methods. We validate PixelSHAP in autonomous driving, highlighting its ability to enhance interpretability. Key challenges include segmentation sensitivity and object occlusion.

Existing studies either require multi-stage pose regression or rely on 2D-3D feature matching. Though these approaches have shown promising results, they rely heavily on appearance information, requiring complex input (i.e., multi-view reference input, depth, or CAD models) and intricate pipeline (i.e., feature extraction-SfM-2D to 3D matching-PnP). We propose AxisPose, a model-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation, which fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing methods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM and PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by leveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects without reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation Module (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes through a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the gradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain the geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated tri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module (TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose achieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N instances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with great potential for generalization to unseen-object level.</p></details> |  | None |

While standard loss functions such as cross-entropy and Dice loss perform well in general cases, they often struggle with fine structures, particularly in tasks involving thin structures or closely packed objects. Various weight map-based loss functions have been proposed to address this issue by assigning higher loss weights to pixels prone to misclassification. However, these methods typically rely on precomputed or runtime-generated weight maps based on distance transforms, which impose significant computational costs and fail to adapt to evolving network predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel steerable pyramid-based weighted (SPW) loss function that efficiently generates adaptive weight maps. Unlike traditional boundary-aware losses that depend on static or iteratively updated distance maps, our method leverages steerable pyramids to dynamically emphasize regions across multiple frequency bands (capturing features at different scales) while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, by incorporating network predictions into the weight computation, our approach enables adaptive refinement during training. We evaluate our method on the SNEMI3D, GlaS, and DRIVE datasets, benchmarking it against 11 state-of-the-art loss functions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SPW loss function achieves superior pixel precision and segmentation accuracy with minimal computational overhead. This work provides an effective and efficient solution for improving semantic segmentation, particularly for applications requiring multiscale feature representation.

A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p></details> |  | None |

In previous methods, potential future trajectories are often absent in the scene encoding stage, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, prior approaches typically employ transformer architectures for spatiotemporal modeling of trajectories and map information, which suffer from the quadratic scaling complexity of the transformer architecture. In this work, we propose an interaction-based method, named Future-Aware Interaction Network, that introduces potential future trajectories into scene encoding for a comprehensive traffic representation. Furthermore, a State Space Model (SSM), specifically Mamba, is introduced for both spatial and temporal modeling. To adapt Mamba for spatial interaction modeling, we propose an adaptive reordering strategy that transforms unordered data into a structured sequence. Additionally, Mamba is employed to refine generated future trajectories temporally, ensuring more consistent predictions. These enhancements not only improve model efficiency but also enhance the accuracy and diversity of predictions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the widely used Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches in a more efficient way. The code will be released according to the acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

As interactive components within autonomous driving systems, VLMs must maintain strong safety cognition during interactions. From this perspective, we propose a novel evaluation method: Safety Cognitive Driving Benchmark (SCD-Bench) . To address the large-scale annotation challenge for SCD-Bench, we develop the Autonomous Driving Image-Text Annotation System (ADA) . Additionally, to ensure data quality in SCD-Bench, our dataset undergoes manual refinement by experts with professional knowledge in autonomous driving. We further develop an automated evaluation method based on large language models (LLMs). To verify its effectiveness, we compare its evaluation results with those of expert human evaluations, achieving a consistency rate of 99.74%. Preliminary experimental results indicate that existing open-source models still lack sufficient safety cognition, showing a significant gap compared to GPT-4o. Notably, lightweight models (1B-4B) demonstrate minimal safety cognition. However, since lightweight models are crucial for autonomous driving systems, this presents a significant challenge for integrating VLMs into the field.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches achieve this by connecting traditional 3D object detectors with vision-language models (VLMs) to regress 3D bounding boxes for novel objects and perform open-vocabulary classification through cross-modal alignment between 3D and 2D features. However, achieving robust cross-modal alignment remains a challenge due to semantic inconsistencies when generating corresponding 3D and 2D feature pairs. To overcome this challenge, we present OV-SCAN, an Open-Vocabulary 3D framework that enforces Semantically Consistent Alignment for Novel object discovery. OV-SCAN employs two core strategies: discovering precise 3D annotations and filtering out low-quality or corrupted alignment pairs (arising from 3D annotation, occlusion-induced, or resolution-induced noise). Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that OV-SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

For lane detection, we propose a CNN-based segmentation method enhanced by polynomial curve fitting, which delivers high accuracy under favorable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight, Multimodal, LLM-based framework that directly undergoes instruction tuning using small yet diverse datasets, eliminating the need for initial pretraining. This framework effectively handles various lane types, complex intersections, and merging zones, significantly enhancing lane detection reliability by reasoning under adverse conditions. Despite constraints in available training resources, our multimodal approach demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities, achieving a Frame Overall Accuracy (FRM) of 53.87%, a Question Overall Accuracy (QNS) of 82.83%, lane detection accuracies of 99.6% in clear conditions and 93.0% at night, and robust performance in reasoning about lane invisibility due to rain (88.4%) or road degradation (95.6%).

While deep models achieve strong performance, their efficiency remains a challenge. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique, but existing feature-based KD methods rely on static, teacher-driven feature selection, failing to adapt to the student's evolving learning state or leverage dynamic student-teacher interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive student-teacher Cooperative Attention Masking for Knowledge Distillation (ACAM-KD), which introduces two key components: (1) Student-Teacher Cross-Attention Feature Fusion (STCA-FF), which adaptively integrates features from both models for a more interactive distillation process, and (2) Adaptive Spatial-Channel Masking (ASCM), which dynamically generates importance masks to enhance both spatial and channel-wise feature selection. Unlike conventional KD methods, ACAM-KD adapts to the student's evolving needs throughout the entire distillation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. For instance, on COCO2017, ACAM-KD improves object detection performance by up to 1.4 mAP over the state-of-the-art when distilling a ResNet-50 student from a ResNet-101 teacher. For semantic segmentation on Cityscapes, it boosts mIoU by 3.09 over the baseline with DeepLabV3-MobileNetV2 as the student model.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 tables, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

To address this, we introduce the first generalized cross-domain few-shot (GCFS) task in 3D object detection, which focuses on adapting a source-pretrained model for high performance on both common and novel classes in a target domain with few-shot samples. Our solution integrates multi-modal fusion and contrastive-enhanced prototype learning within one framework, holistically overcoming challenges related to data scarcity and domain adaptation in the GCFS setting. The multi-modal fusion module utilizes 2D vision-language models to extract rich, open-set semantic knowledge. To address biases in point distributions across varying structural complexities, we particularly introduce a physically-aware box searching strategy that leverages laser imaging principles to generate high-quality 3D box proposals from 2D insights, enhancing object recall. To effectively capture domain-specific representations for each class from limited target data, we further propose a contrastive-enhanced prototype learning, which strengthens the model's adaptability. We evaluate our approach with three GCFS benchmark settings, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for GCFS tasks.

Although sparse-point methods lower computational load and maintain high accuracy in complex lane geometries, current methods fail to fully leverage the geometric structure of lanes in both lane geometry representations and model design. In lane geometry representations, we present a theoretical analysis alongside experimental validation to verify that current sparse lane representation methods contain inherent flaws, resulting in potential errors of up to 20 m, which raise significant safety concerns for driving. To address this issue, we propose a novel patching strategy to completely represent the full lane structure. To enable existing models to match this strategy, we introduce the EndPoint head (EP-head), which adds a patching distance to endpoints. The EP-head enables the model to predict more complete lane representations even with fewer preset points, effectively addressing existing limitations and paving the way for models that are faster and require fewer parameters in the future. In model design, to enhance the model's perception of lane structures, we propose the PointLane attention (PL-attention), which incorporates prior geometric knowledge into the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on various state-of-the-art models. For instance, in terms of the overall F1-score, our methods improve Persformer by 4.4 points, Anchor3DLane by 3.2 points, and LATR by 2.8 points.

To address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal planner. We validate our planners using state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms in autonomous driving simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology SI: Intelligent Decision Making, Planning and Control of Automated Vehicles</p></details> | None |

However, the presence of dynamic objects in the scene seriously affects the accuracy of the model inferring 3D structures from 2D images. Existing methods simply stack multiple frames of image input to increase dense scene semantic information, but ignore the fact that dynamic objects and non-texture areas violate multi-view consistency and matching reliability. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, CDScene: Vision-based Robust Semantic Scene Completion via Capturing Dynamic Representations. First, we leverage a multimodal large-scale model to extract 2D explicit semantics and align them into 3D space. Second, we exploit the characteristics of monocular and stereo depth to decouple scene information into dynamic and static features. The dynamic features contain structural relationships around dynamic objects, and the static features contain dense contextual spatial information. Finally, we design a dynamic-static adaptive fusion module to effectively extract and aggregate complementary features, achieving robust and accurate semantic scene completion in autonomous driving scenarios. Extensive experimental results on the SemanticKITTI, SSCBench-KITTI360, and SemanticKITTI-C datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of CDScene over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, images provide limited information making the model susceptible to geometric ambiguity caused by occlusion and perspective distortion. Existing methods often lack explicit semantic modeling between objects, limiting their perception of 3D semantic context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method VLScene: Vision-Language Guidance Distillation for Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion. The key insight is to use the vision-language model to introduce high-level semantic priors to provide the object spatial context required for 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we design a vision-language guidance distillation process to enhance image features, which can effectively capture semantic knowledge from the surrounding environment and improve spatial context reasoning. In addition, we introduce a geometric-semantic sparse awareness mechanism to propagate geometric structures in the neighborhood and enhance semantic information through contextual sparse interactions.

| **[Treble Counterfactual VLMs: A Causal Approach to Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06169v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multi-modal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and reasoning. However, they often generate hallucinated outputs inconsistent with the visual context or prompt, limiting reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging. Existing studies link hallucination to statistical biases, language priors, and biased feature learning but lack a structured causal understanding. In this work, we introduce a causal perspective to analyze and mitigate hallucination in VLMs. We hypothesize that hallucination arises from unintended direct influences of either the vision or text modality, bypassing proper multi-modal fusion. To address this, we construct a causal graph for VLMs and employ counterfactual analysis to estimate the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of vision, text, and their cross-modal interaction on the output. We systematically identify and mitigate these unintended direct effects to ensure that responses are primarily driven by genuine multi-modal fusion. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) designing structural causal graphs to distinguish correct fusion pathways from spurious modality shortcuts, (2) estimating modality-specific and cross-modal NDE using perturbed image representations, hallucinated text embeddings, and degraded visual inputs, and (3) implementing a test-time intervention module to dynamically adjust the model's dependence on each modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination while preserving task performance, providing a robust and interpretable framework for improving VLM reliability.

While deploying personalized OOD detection directly on edge devices is desirable, it remains challenging due to large model sizes and the computational infeasibility of on-device training. Federated learning partially addresses this but still requires gradient computation and backpropagation, exceeding the capabilities of many edge devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose SecDOOD, a secure cloud-device collaboration framework for efficient on-device OOD detection without requiring device-side backpropagation. SecDOOD utilizes cloud resources for model training while ensuring user data privacy by retaining sensitive information on-device. Central to SecDOOD is a HyperNetwork-based personalized parameter generation module, which adapts cloud-trained models to device-specific distributions by dynamically generating local weight adjustments, effectively combining central and local information without local fine-tuning. Additionally, our dynamic feature sampling and encryption strategy selectively encrypts only the most informative feature channels, largely reducing encryption overhead without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and OOD scenarios demonstrate that SecDOOD achieves performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, enabling secure, efficient, and personalized OOD detection on resource-limited edge devices.

Experimental results demonstrate that the various errors of our model have decreased by approximately 50% in comparison with the current state-of-the-art end-to-end trajectory prediction algorithm of the same type. Our approach thus provides an effective solution for fully differentiable automatic parking.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security.

The global planner utilizes the informed Theta-Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (Informed-TRRT*) algorithm to generate an optimal reference path, while the local planner combines Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Pure Pursuit algorithms. Mutual Information (MI) is employed to fuse the outputs of the MPC and Pure Pursuit controllers, effectively balancing their strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. The proposed method addresses the challenges of navigating in dynamic environments with unpredictable obstacles by reducing uncertainty in local path planning and improving dynamic obstacle avoidance capabilities.

However, a major challenge in this paradigm lies in effectively utilizing available driving data, as collecting new data is resource-intensive and often limited in its ability to cover diverse driving scenarios. While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation strategy that enhances imitation learning by leveraging the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured through the AV's sensors, as additional expert demonstrations. We introduce a vehicle selection sampling strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer and more diverse dataset for training. We evaluate our approach using the state-of-the-art learning-based planning method PLUTO on the nuPlan dataset and demonstrate that our augmentation method leads to improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, our method reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10% of the original dataset, our method achieves performance comparable to that of the full dataset, with improved collision rates. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Explainability is especially important for safety-critical applications, and due to the variety of object detectors and their often proprietary nature, black-box explainability tools are needed. However, existing black-box explainability tools for AI models rely on multiple model calls, rendering them impractical for real-time use. In this paper, we introduce IncX, an algorithm and a tool for real-time black-box explainability for object detectors. The algorithm is based on linear transformations of saliency maps, producing sufficient explanations. We evaluate our implementation on four widely used video datasets of autonomous driving and demonstrate that IncX's explanations are comparable in quality to the state-of-the-art and are computed two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, making them usable in real time.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, existing solutions often rely on carefully crafted, task specific extrinsic rewards, limiting generalization to new tasks or environments. In this paper, we propose InDRiVE (Intrinsic Disagreement based Reinforcement for Vehicle Exploration), a method that leverages purely intrinsic, disagreement based rewards within a Dreamer based MBRL framework. By training an ensemble of world models, the agent actively explores high uncertainty regions of environments without any task specific feedback. This approach yields a task agnostic latent representation, allowing for rapid zero shot or few shot fine tuning on downstream driving tasks such as lane following and collision avoidance. Experimental results in both seen and unseen environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves higher success rates and fewer infractions compared to DreamerV2 and DreamerV3 baselines despite using significantly fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of purely intrinsic exploration for learning robust vehicle control behaviors, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IROS 2025 and is currently under review</p></details> | None |
| **[FastMap: Fast Queries Initialization Based Vectorized HD Map Reconstruction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05492v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstruction of high-definition maps is a crucial task in perceiving the autonomous driving environment, as its accuracy directly impacts the reliability of prediction and planning capabilities in downstream modules. Current vectorized map reconstruction methods based on the DETR framework encounter limitations due to the redundancy in the decoder structure, necessitating the stacking of six decoder layers to maintain performance, which significantly hampers computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we introduce FastMap, an innovative framework designed to reduce decoder redundancy in existing approaches. FastMap optimizes the decoder architecture by employing a single-layer, two-stage transformer that achieves multilevel representation capabilities. Our framework eliminates the conventional practice of randomly initializing queries and instead incorporates a heatmap-guided query generation module during the decoding phase, which effectively maps image features into structured query vectors using learnable positional encoding. Additionally, we propose a geometry-constrained point-to-line loss mechanism for FastMap, which adeptly addresses the challenge of distinguishing highly homogeneous features that often arise in traditional point-to-point loss computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastMap achieves state-of-the-art performance in both nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, with its decoder operating 3.2 faster than the baseline.

Unlike prior methods focused on synthetic data or elastic jittering along the contact surface, which prevent objects from fully detaching or moving independently, DecoupledGaussian allows for significant positional changes without being constrained by the initial contacted surface. Recognizing the limitations of current 2D inpainting tools for restoring 3D locations, our approach proposes joint Poisson fields to repair and expand the Gaussians of both objects and contacted scenes after separation. This is complemented by a multi-carve strategy to refine the object's geometry. Our system enables realistic simulations of decoupling motions, collisions, and fractures driven by user-specified impulses, supporting complex interactions within and across multiple scenes. We validate DecoupledGaussian through a comprehensive user study and quantitative benchmarks. This system enhances digital interaction with objects and scenes in real-world environments, benefiting industries such as VR, robotics, and autonomous driving.

| **[PRAM: Place Recognition Anywhere Model for Efficient Visual Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07785v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual localization is a key technique to a variety of applications, e.g., autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics. For these real applications, both efficiency and accuracy are important especially on edge devices with limited computing resources. However, previous frameworks, e.g., absolute pose regression (APR), scene coordinate regression (SCR), and the hierarchical method (HM), have limited either accuracy or efficiency in both indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose the place recognition anywhere model (PRAM), a new framework, to perform visual localization efficiently and accurately by recognizing 3D landmarks. Specifically, PRAM first generates landmarks directly in 3D space in a self-supervised manner. Without relying on commonly used classic semantic labels, these 3D landmarks can be defined in any place in indoor and outdoor scenes with higher generalization ability. Representing the map with 3D landmarks, PRAM discards global descriptors, repetitive local descriptors, and redundant 3D points, increasing the memory efficiency significantly. Then, sparse keypoints, rather than dense pixels, are utilized as the input tokens to a transformer-based recognition module for landmark recognition, which enables PRAM to recognize hundreds of landmarks with high time and memory efficiency. At test time, sparse keypoints and predicted landmark labels are utilized for outlier removal and landmark-wise 2D-3D matching as opposed to exhaustive 2D-2D matching, which further increases the time efficiency. A comprehensive evaluation of APRs, SCRs, HMs, and PRAM on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates that PRAM outperforms ARPs and SCRs in large-scale scenes with a large margin and gives competitive accuracy to HMs but reduces over 90\% memory cost and runs 2.4 times faster, leading to a better balance between efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://feixue94.github.io/pram-project/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://feixue94.github.io/pram-project) |

These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains.

However, existing E2E-AD methods usually adopt the sequential paradigm of perception-prediction-planning, which leads to cumulative errors and training instability. The manual ordering of tasks also limits the system`s ability to leverage synergies between tasks (for example, planning-aware perception and game-theoretic interactive prediction and planning). Moreover, the dense BEV representation adopted by existing methods brings computational challenges for long-range perception and long-term temporal fusion. To address these challenges, we present DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework for the ease of scaling up, characterized by three key features: Task Parallelism (All agent, map, and planning queries direct interact with each other at each block), Sparse Representation (Task queries direct interact with raw sensor features), and Streaming Processing (Task queries are stored and passed as history information). As a result, the new framework is composed of three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, temporal cross-attention, which significantly reduces the complexity of system and leads to better training stability. DriveTransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and real world open-loop benchmark nuScenes with high FPS.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 | None |

While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Nowadays, LiDAR inertial odometry becomes increasingly prevalent in robotics and autonomous driving. However, many current SLAM systems lack sufficient adaptability to various scenarios. Challenges include decreased point cloud accuracy with longer frame intervals under the constant velocity assumption, coupling of erroneous IMU information when IMU saturation occurs, and decreased localization accuracy due to the use of fixed-resolution maps during indoor-outdoor scene transitions.

Traditional methods often struggle with occlusions, variable lighting conditions, and the structural variability of crop rows. To address these challenges, RowDetr, a novel end-to-end neural network architecture, is introduced for robust and efficient row detection. A new dataset of approximately 6,900 images is curated, capturing a diverse range of real-world agricultural conditions, including occluded rows, uneven terrain, and varying crop densities. Unlike previous approaches, RowDetr leverages smooth polynomial functions to precisely delineate crop boundaries in the image space, ensuring a more structured and interpretable representation of row geometry. A key innovation of this approach is PolyOptLoss, a novel energy-based loss function designed to enhance learning robustness, even in the presence of noisy or imperfect labels.

Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps.

Specifically, trajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for specific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate future predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for low-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some work has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized autonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles for trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most certainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case scenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic psychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets for trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving styles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving styles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with edge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing real-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the lens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of risks, including not only collision risks but also traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in the Carla simulator.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GSPR: Multimodal Place Recognition Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00299v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Place recognition is a crucial component that enables autonomous vehicles to obtain localization results in GPS-denied environments. In recent years, multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention. They overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However, most existing methods explore cross-modality correlations through feature-level or descriptor-level fusion, suffering from a lack of interpretability. Conversely, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new perspective on multimodal fusion by harmonizing different modalities into an explicit scene representation. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph convolution and transformer is designed to extract spatio-temporal features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition. Extensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance while maintaining solid generalization ability. Our open-source code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/GSPR.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/GSPR) |

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC) |

This study introduces an innovative perceived risk prediction model for human-machine interaction in intelligent driving systems. The model aims to enhance prediction accuracy and, thereby, ensure passenger safety. Through a comprehensive analysis of risk impact mechanisms, we identify three key categories of factors, both subjective and objective, influencing perceived risk: driver's personal characteristics, ego-vehicle motion, and surrounding environment characteristics. We then propose a deep-learning-based risk prediction network that uses the first two categories of factors as inputs. The network captures the interactive relationships among traffic participants in dynamic driving scenarios. Additionally, we design a personalized modeling strategy that incorporates driver-specific traits to improve prediction accuracy. To ensure high-quality training data, we conducted a rigorous video rating experiment. Experimental results show that the proposed network achieves a 10.0% performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods. These findings suggest that the proposed network has significant potential to enhance the safety of conditional autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables.

However, generating long-duration, surround-view consistent driving videos remains a significant challenge. To address this, we present UniMLVG, a unified framework designed to generate extended street multi-perspective videos under precise control. By integrating single- and multi-view driving videos into the training data, our approach updates a DiT-based diffusion model equipped with cross-frame and cross-view modules across three stages with multi training objectives, substantially boosting the diversity and quality of generated visual content. Importantly, we propose an innovative explicit viewpoint modeling approach for multi-view video generation to effectively improve motion transition consistency. Capable of handling various input reference formats (e.g., text, images, or video), our UniMLVG generates high-quality multi-view videos according to the corresponding condition constraints such as 3D bounding boxes or frame-level text descriptions.

| **[FRNet: Frustum-Range Networks for Scalable LiDAR Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04484v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR segmentation has become a crucial component of advanced autonomous driving systems. Recent range-view LiDAR segmentation approaches show promise for real-time processing. However, they inevitably suffer from corrupted contextual information and rely heavily on post-processing techniques for prediction refinement. In this work, we propose FRNet, a simple yet powerful method aimed at restoring the contextual information of range image pixels using corresponding frustum LiDAR points. First, a frustum feature encoder module is used to extract per-point features within the frustum region, which preserves scene consistency and is critical for point-level predictions. Next, a frustum-point fusion module is introduced to update per-point features hierarchically, enabling each point to extract more surrounding information through the frustum features. Finally, a head fusion module is used to fuse features at different levels for final semantic predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on four popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks under various task setups demonstrate the superiority of FRNet. Notably, FRNet achieves 73.3% and 82.5% mIoU scores on the testing sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. While achieving competitive performance, FRNet operates 5 times faster than state-of-the-art approaches. Such high efficiency opens up new possibilities for more scalable LiDAR segmentation.

However, challenges, such as data heterogeneity and severely missing modalities, pose crucial hindrances to the robustness of MFL, significantly impacting the performance of global model. The occurrence of missing modalities in real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, often arises from factors like sensor failures, leading knowledge gaps during the training process. Specifically, the absence of a modality introduces misalignment during the local training phase, stemming from zero-filling in the case of clients with missing modalities. Consequently, achieving robust generalization in global model becomes imperative, especially when dealing with clients that have incomplete data. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{Multimodal Federated Cross Prototype Learning (MFCPL)}$, a novel approach for MFL under severely missing modalities. Our MFCPL leverages the complete prototypes to provide diverse modality knowledge in modality-shared level with the cross-modal regularization and modality-specific level with cross-modal contrastive mechanism. Additionally, our approach introduces the cross-modal alignment to provide regularization for modality-specific features, thereby enhancing the overall performance, particularly in scenarios involving severely missing modalities. Through extensive experiments on three multimodal datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MFCPL in mitigating the challenges of data heterogeneity and severely missing modalities while improving the overall performance and robustness of MFL.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose the Momentum-Aware Driving (MomAD) framework, which introduces trajectory momentum and perception momentum to stabilize and refine trajectory predictions. MomAD comprises two core components: (1) Topological Trajectory Matching (TTM) employs Hausdorff Distance to select the optimal planning query that aligns with prior paths to ensure coherence;(2) Momentum Planning Interactor (MPI) cross-attends the selected planning query with historical queries to expand static and dynamic perception files. This enriched query, in turn, helps regenerate long-horizon trajectory and reduce collision risks. To mitigate noise arising from dynamic environments and detection errors, we introduce robust instance denoising during training, enabling the planning model to focus on critical signals and improve its robustness. We also propose a novel Trajectory Prediction Consistency (TPC) metric to quantitatively assess planning stability. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MomAD achieves superior long-term consistency (>=3s) compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, evaluations on the curated Turning-nuScenes shows that MomAD reduces the collision rate by 26% and improves TPC by 0.97m (33.45%) over a 6s prediction horizon, while closedloop on Bench2Drive demonstrates an up to 16.3% improvement in success rate.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures | None |

Each 3D Gaussian function represents a flexible region of interest and its semantic features, which are iteratively refined by the attention mechanism. In the experiment, it is found that the Gaussian function required by this method is larger than the query resolution of the original dense grid network, resulting in impaired performance. Therefore, we consider optimizing GaussianFormer by using unused temporal information. We learn the Spatial-Temporal Self-attention Mechanism from the previous grid-given occupation network and improve it to GaussianFormer. The experiment was conducted with the NuScenes dataset, and the experiment is currently underway.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, conventional monocular visual odometry encoun-ters challenges in scale estimation due to the absence of depth information during projection. Previous methodologies, whether rooted in physical constraints or deep learning paradigms, con-tend with issues related to computational complexity and the management of dynamic objects. This study extends our prior research, presenting innovative strategies for ego-motion estima-tion and the selection of ground points. Striving for a nuanced equilibrium between computational efficiency and precision, we propose a hybrid method that leverages the SegNeXt model for real-time applications, encompassing both ego-motion estimation and ground point selection. Our methodology incorporates dy-namic object masks to eliminate unstable features and employs ground plane masks for meticulous triangulation. Furthermore, we exploit Geometry-constraint to delineate road regions for scale recovery. The integration of this approach with the mo-nocular version of ORB-SLAM3 culminates in the accurate esti-mation of a road model, a pivotal component in our scale recov-ery process. Rigorous experiments, conducted on the KITTI da-taset, systematically compare our method with existing monocu-lar visual odometry algorithms and contemporary scale recovery methodologies. The results undeniably confirm the superior ef-fectiveness of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms.

Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment.

In addition, to address the scarcity of collision data, we propose CollisionGen, a scalable data generation pipeline to generate diverse, high-quality scenarios using natural language prompts, generative models, and rule-based filtering. Experimental results show that our approach improves planning performance in collision-prone scenarios by 56\% over previous state-of-the-art planners while maintaining effectiveness in regular driving situations.

The primary challenge in becoming a fully reliable alternative lies in robust depth prediction capabilities, as camera-based systems struggle with long detection ranges and adverse lighting and weather conditions. In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion architecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of dense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid fusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar features in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association Transformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to produce more robust and accurate depth predictions.

With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes.

In this paper, we consider the problem of synchronous data collection from the open-source CARLA simulator using multiple sensors attached to vehicle based on user-defined criteria. We propose a novel, one-step framework that we refer to as Car-STAGE, based on CARLA simulator, to generate data using a graphical user interface (GUI) defining configuration parameters to data collection without any user intervention. This framework can utilize the user-defined configuration parameters such as choice of maps, number and configurations of sensors, environmental and lighting conditions etc. to run the simulation in the background, collecting high-dimensional sensor data from diverse sensors such as RGB Camera, LiDAR, Radar, Depth Camera, IMU Sensor, GNSS Sensor, Semantic Segmentation Camera, Instance Segmentation Camera, and Optical Flow Camera along with the ground-truths of the individual actors and storing the sensor data as well as ground-truth labels in a local or cloud-based database. The framework uses multiple threads where a main thread runs the server, a worker thread deals with queue and frame number and the rest of the threads processes the sensor data. The other way we derive speed up over the native implementation is by memory mapping the raw binary data into the disk and then converting the data into known formats at the end of data collection. We show that using these techniques, we gain a significant speed up over frames, under an increasing set of sensors and over the number of spawned objects.</p></details> |  | None |

PML, inspired by human motor learning, emphasizes the seamless integration of perception and action, enabling efficient decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional autonomous driving approaches--including modular pipelines, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning--struggle with adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize prediction error ("surprise") and actively shape vehicle control based on learned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning with active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping maneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different environments. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that PML with AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while achieving performance comparable to conventional methods. These findings highlight the potential of PML-driven active inference as a robust alternative for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IROS 2025 and is currently under review. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.07684</p></details> | None |

Large Language Models (LLMs) possess reasoning capabilities and natural language understanding, presenting the potential to serve as generalized decision-makers for ego-motion planning that can interact with humans and navigate environments designed for human drivers. While this research avenue is promising, current autonomous driving approaches are challenged by combining 3D spatial grounding and the reasoning and language capabilities of LLMs. We introduce BEVDriver, an LLM-based model for end-to-end closed-loop driving in CARLA that utilizes latent BEV features as perception input. BEVDriver includes a BEV encoder to efficiently process multi-view images and 3D LiDAR point clouds. Within a common latent space, the BEV features are propagated through a Q-Former to align with natural language instructions and passed to the LLM that predicts and plans precise future trajectories while considering navigation instructions and critical scenarios. On the LangAuto benchmark, our model reaches up to 18.9% higher performance on the Driving Score compared to SoTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> | None |

However, designing effective data-driven FF controllers in multi-agent systems requires significant data collection, including transferring private or proprietary data, which raises privacy concerns and incurs high communication costs. Therefore, we propose a novel approach integrating Federated Learning (FL) into FF control to address these challenges. This approach enables privacy-preserving, communication-efficient, and decentralized continuous improvement of FF controllers across multiple agents without sharing personal or proprietary data. By leveraging FL, each agent learns a local, neural FF controller using its data and contributes only model updates to a global aggregation process, ensuring data privacy and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an autonomous driving use case. Therein, vehicles equipped with a trajectory-tracking feedback controller are enhanced by FL-based neural FF control. Simulations highlight significant improvements in tracking performance compared to pure FB control, analogous to model-based FF control. We achieve comparable tracking performance without exchanging private vehicle-specific data compared to a centralized neural FF control. Our results underscore the potential of FL-based neural FF control to enable privacy-preserving learning in multi-agent control systems, paving the way for scalable and efficient autonomous systems applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[Human-aligned Safe Reinforcement Learning for Highway On-Ramp Merging in Dense Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02624v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for the decision-making of autonomous driving consider safety as a reward instead of a cost, which makes it hard to balance the tradeoff between safety and other objectives. Human risk preference has also rarely been incorporated, and the trained policy might be either conservative or aggressive for users. To this end, this study proposes a human-aligned safe RL approach for autonomous merging, in which the high-level decision problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) that incorporates users' risk preference into the safety constraints, followed by a model predictive control (MPC)-based low-level control. The safety level of RL policy can be adjusted by computing cost limits of CMDP's constraints based on risk preferences and traffic density using a fuzzy control method. To filter out unsafe or invalid actions, we design an action shielding mechanism that pre-executes RL actions using an MPC method and performs collision checks with surrounding agents. We also provide theoretical proof to validate the effectiveness of the shielding mechanism in enhancing RL's safety and sample efficiency. Simulation experiments in multiple levels of traffic densities show that our method can significantly reduce safety violations without sacrificing traffic efficiency. Furthermore, due to the use of risk preference-aware constraints in CMDP and action shielding, we can not only adjust the safety level of the final policy but also reduce safety violations during the training stage, proving a promising solution for online learning in real-world environments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures | None |

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PlanScope: Learning to Plan Within Decision Scope Does Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00476v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of autonomous driving, learning-based methods have been promising for the development of planning modules. During the training process of planning modules, directly minimizing the discrepancy between expert-driving logs and planning output is widely deployed. In general, driving logs consist of suddenly appearing obstacles or swiftly changing traffic signals, which typically necessitate swift and nuanced adjustments in driving maneuvers. Concurrently, future trajectories of the vehicles exhibit their long-term decisions, such as adhering to a reference lane or circumventing stationary obstacles. Due to the unpredictable influence of future events in driving logs, reasoning bias could be naturally introduced to learning based planning modules, which leads to a possible degradation of driving performance. To address this issue, we identify the decisions and their corresponding time horizons, and characterize a so-called decision scope by retaining decisions within derivable horizons only, to mitigate the effect of irrational behaviors caused by unpredictable events. Several viable implementations have been proposed, among which batch normalization along the temporal dimension is particularly effective and achieves superior performance. It consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of driving scores, as demonstrated through closed-loop evaluations on the nuPlan dataset. Essentially, this approach accommodates an appealing plug-and-play feature to enhance the closed-loop performance of other learning-based planning models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, models trained solely on single-task objectives or generic datasets often lack the contextual information needed for robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified encoder trained on multiple computer vision tasks crucial for urban driving, including depth, pose, and 3D scene flow estimation, as well as semantic, instance, panoptic, and motion segmentation. By integrating these diverse visual cues-similar to human perceptual mechanisms-the encoder captures rich features that enhance navigation-related predictions. We evaluate the model on steering estimation as a downstream task, leveraging its dense latent space. To ensure efficient multi-task learning, we introduce a multi-scale feature network for pose estimation and apply knowledge distillation from a multi-backbone teacher model. Our findings highlight two key findings: (1) the unified encoder achieves competitive performance across all visual perception tasks, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities; and (2) for steering estimation, the frozen unified encoder-leveraging dense latent representations-outperforms both its fine-tuned counterpart and the same frozen model pretrained on generic datasets like ImageNet. These results underline the significance of task-specific visual features and demonstrate the promise of multi-task learning in advancing autonomous driving systems.

Cross-view pose optimization offers an effective solution by directly estimating vehicle pose using satellite-view images. However, existing methods primarily rely on cross-view features at a given pose, neglecting fine-grained contexts for precision and global contexts for robustness against large initial pose errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose PIDLoc, a novel cross-view pose optimization approach inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Using RGB images and LiDAR, the PIDLoc comprises the PID branches to model cross-view feature relationships and the spatially aware pose estimator (SPE) to estimate the pose from these relationships. The PID branches leverage feature differences for local context (P), aggregated feature differences for global context (I), and gradients of feature differences for precise pose adjustment (D) to enhance localization accuracy under large initial pose errors. Integrated with the PID branches, the SPE captures spatial relationships within the PID-branch features for consistent localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIDLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-view pose estimation for the KITTI dataset, reducing position error by $37.8\%$ compared with the previous state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR-25 | None |

The creation of segmented scenarios within a simulated environment is acknowledged as a robust and effective strategy; however, the process of tailoring these scenarios often necessitates laborious and time-consuming manual efforts, thereby hindering the development and implementation of AD technologies. In response to this challenge, we introduce Text2Scenario, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to autonomously generate simulation test scenarios that closely align with user specifications, derived from their natural language inputs. Specifically, an LLM, equipped with a meticulously engineered input prompt scheme functions as a text parser for test scenario descriptions, extracting from a hierarchically organized scenario repository the components that most accurately reflect the user's preferences. Subsequently, by exploiting the precedence of scenario components, the process involves sequentially matching and linking scenario representations within a Domain Specific Language corpus, ultimately fabricating executable test scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that such prompt engineering can meticulously extract the nuanced details of scenario elements embedded within various descriptive formats, with the majority of generated scenarios aligning closely with the user's initial expectations, allowing for the efficient and precise evaluation of diverse AD stacks void of the labor-intensive need for manual scenario configuration.

Although recent data-driven approaches advance realistic behavior generation, their learning still relies primarily on a single real-world dataset, which limits their diversity and thereby hinders downstream algorithm optimization. In this paper, we propose DriveGen, a novel traffic simulation framework with large models for more diverse traffic generation that supports further customized designs. DriveGen consists of two internal stages: the initialization stage uses large language model and retrieval technique to generate map and vehicle assets; the rollout stage outputs trajectories with selected waypoint goals from visual language model and a specific designed diffusion planner. Through this two-staged process, DriveGen fully utilizes large models' high-level cognition and reasoning of driving behavior, obtaining greater diversity beyond datasets while maintaining high realism. To support effective downstream optimization, we additionally develop DriveGen-CS, an automatic corner case generation pipeline that uses failures of the driving algorithm as additional prompt knowledge for large models without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that our generated scenarios and corner cases have a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Downstream experiments further verify that the synthesized traffic of DriveGen provides better optimization of the performance of typical driving algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, despite the perception stability in harsh environments, the point cloud generated by mmWave radar is relatively sparse while containing significant noise, which limits its further development.

Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been explored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout choice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on multi-channel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this limitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed specifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments. ECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation Model (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring both robust generalizability and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional adaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank adaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the nested Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer layer of the underlying FM is treated as a separate expert, with embeddings extracted from these experts fused using trainable weights within a gating mechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local ECG features, leading to a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 7% increase in the F1 score, all while maintaining computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG-EmotionNet architecture is evaluated using a recently introduced and challenging driver emotion monitoring dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

CAPS addresses the challenge of imbalanced training datasets in imitation learning by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs). The use of VQ-VAE provides a structured and interpretable data representation, which helps reveal meaningful patterns in the data. These patterns are used to group the data into clusters, with each sample being assigned a cluster ID. The cluster IDs are then used to re-balance the dataset, ensuring that rare yet valuable samples receive higher priority during training. By ensuring a more diverse and informative training set, CAPS improves the generalization of the trained planner across a wide range of driving scenarios. We evaluate our method through closed-loop simulations in the CARLA environment.

However, with the emergence of new applications, traditional communication technologies face the problems of scarce spectrum resources and high latency. Semantic communication, which focuses on extracting, transmitting, and recovering some useful semantic information from messages, can reduce redundant data transmission, improve spectrum utilization, and provide innovative solutions to communication challenges in the IoV. This paper systematically reviews state of art of semantic communications in the IoV, elaborates the technical background of IoV and semantic communications, and deeply discusses key technologies of semantic communications in IoV, including semantic information extraction, semantic communication architecture, resource allocation and management, and so on. Through specific case studies, it demonstrates that semantic communications can be effectively employed in the scenarios of traffic environment perception and understanding, intelligent driving decision support, IoV service optimization, and intelligent traffic management. Additionally, it analyzes the current challenges and future research directions. This survey reveals that semantic communications has broad application prospects in IoV, but it is necessary to solve the real existing problems by combining advanced technologies to promote its wide application in IoV and contributing to the development of intelligent transportation system.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to Entropy</p></details> | None |

However, existing path planning methodologies fall short of addressing this need due to their incapability to handle the diverse and complex parking scenarios in reality. While non-learning methods provide reliable planning results, they are vulnerable to intricate occasions, whereas learning-based ones are good at exploration but unstable in converging to feasible solutions. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we introduce Hybrid pOlicy Path plannEr (HOPE). This novel solution integrates a reinforcement learning agent with Reeds-Shepp curves, enabling effective planning across diverse scenarios. HOPE guides the exploration of the reinforcement learning agent by applying an action mask mechanism and employs a transformer to integrate the perceived environmental information with the mask.

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception. Code and models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RALAD: Bridging the Real-to-Sim Domain Gap in Autonomous Driving with Retrieval-Augmented Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12296v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of robust autonomous driving systems, models trained on real-world datasets often struggle to adapt to new environments, particularly when confronted with corner cases such as extreme weather conditions. Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, which necessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the high computational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered the seamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost of our approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%.

Despite its popularity, the limitations of infrared cameras, such as low spatial resolution and complex degradations, consistently challenge imaging quality and subsequent visual tasks. Hence, infrared image super-resolution (IISR) has been developed to address this challenge. While recent developments in diffusion models have greatly advanced this field, current methods to solve it either ignore the unique modal characteristics of infrared imaging or overlook the machine perception requirements. To bridge these gaps, we propose DifIISR, an infrared image super-resolution diffusion model optimized for visual quality and perceptual performance. Our approach achieves task-based guidance for diffusion by injecting gradients derived from visual and perceptual priors into the noise during the reverse process. Specifically, we introduce an infrared thermal spectrum distribution regulation to preserve visual fidelity, ensuring that the reconstructed infrared images closely align with high-resolution images by matching their frequency components. Subsequently, we incorporate various visual foundational models as the perceptual guidance for downstream visual tasks, infusing generalizable perceptual features beneficial for detection and segmentation. As a result, our approach gains superior visual results while attaining State-Of-The-Art downstream task performance.

While Federated Learning (FL) could improve the generalization of an AD model (known as FedAD system), conventional models often struggle with under-fitting as the amount of accumulated training data progressively increases. To address this issue, instead of conventional small models, employing Large Vision Models (LVMs) in FedAD is a viable option for better learning of representations from a vast volume of data. However, implementing LVMs in FedAD introduces three challenges: (I) the extremely high communication overheads associated with transmitting LVMs between participating vehicles and a central server; (II) lack of computing resource to deploy LVMs on each vehicle; (III) the performance drop due to LVM focusing on shared features but overlooking local vehicle characteristics. To overcome these challenges, we propose pFedLVM, a LVM-Driven, Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning framework. In this approach, the LVM is deployed only on central server, which effectively alleviates the computational burden on individual vehicles. Furthermore, the exchange between central server and vehicles are the learned features rather than the LVM parameters, which significantly reduces communication overhead. In addition, we utilize both shared features from all participating vehicles and individual characteristics from each vehicle to establish a personalized learning mechanism. This enables each vehicle's model to learn features from others while preserving its personalized characteristics, thereby outperforming globally shared models trained in general FL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that pFedLVM outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to CVPR 2024 in Nov. 2023</p></details> | None |

However, traditional simulation systems, which often heavily rely on manual modeling and 2D image editing, struggled with scaling to extensive scenes and generating realistic simulation data. In this study, we present S-NeRF++, an innovative autonomous driving simulation system based on neural reconstruction. Trained on widely-used self-driving datasets such as nuScenes and Waymo, S-NeRF++ can generate a large number of realistic street scenes and foreground objects with high rendering quality as well as offering considerable flexibility in manipulation and simulation. Specifically, S-NeRF++ is an enhanced neural radiance field for synthesizing large-scale scenes and moving vehicles, with improved scene parameterization and camera pose learning. The system effectively utilizes noisy and sparse LiDAR data to refine training and address depth outliers, ensuring high-quality reconstruction and novel-view rendering. It also provides a diverse foreground asset bank by reconstructing and generating different foreground vehicles to support comprehensive scenario creation.Moreover, we have developed an advanced foreground-background fusion pipeline that skillfully integrates illumination and shadow effects, further enhancing the realism of our simulations. With the high-quality simulated data provided by our S-NeRF++, we found the perception methods enjoy performance boosts on several autonomous driving downstream tasks, further demonstrating our proposed simulator's effectiveness.</p></details> | IEEE TPAMI 2025 | None |
| **[Road Boundary Detection Using 4D mmWave Radar for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01930v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting road boundaries, the static physical edges of the available driving area, is important for safe navigation and effective path planning in autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Traditionally, road boundary detection in autonomous driving relies on cameras and LiDAR. However, they are vulnerable to poor lighting conditions, such as nighttime and direct sunlight glare, or prohibitively expensive for low-end vehicles. To this end, this paper introduces 4DRadarRBD, the first road boundary detection method based on 4D mmWave radar which is cost-effective and robust in complex driving scenarios. The main idea is that road boundaries (e.g., fences, bushes, roadblocks), reflect millimeter waves, thus generating point cloud data for the radar. To overcome the challenge that the 4D mmWave radar point clouds contain many noisy points, we initially reduce noisy points via physical constraints for road boundaries and then segment the road boundary points from the noisy points by incorporating a distance-based loss which penalizes for falsely detecting the points far away from the actual road boundaries. In addition, we capture the temporal dynamics of point cloud sequences by utilizing each point's deviation from the vehicle motion-compensated road boundary detection result obtained from the previous frame, along with the spatial distribution of the point cloud for point-wise road boundary segmentation. We evaluated 4DRadarRBD through real-world driving tests and achieved a road boundary point segmentation accuracy of 93$\%$, with a median distance error of up to 0.023 m and an error reduction of 92.6$\%$ compared to the baseline model.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the increased connectivity and massive data exchange for ML applications introduce significant privacy challenges. Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) offers potential solutions to address these challenges by preserving privacy at various stages of the ML pipeline. Despite the rapid development of ML-based IoV applications and the growing data privacy concerns, there are limited comprehensive studies on the adoption of PPML within this domain. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive review of the fundamentals, recent advancements, and the challenges of integrating PPML into IoV applications. To conduct an extensive study, we first review existing surveys of various PPML techniques and their integration into IoV across different scopes. We then discuss the fundamentals of IoV and propose a four-layer IoV architecture. Additionally, we categorize IoV applications into three key domains and analyze the privacy challenges in leveraging ML for these application domains. Next, we provide an overview of various PPML techniques, highlighting their applicability and performance to address the privacy challenges. Building on these fundamentals, we thoroughly review recent advancements in integrating various PPML techniques within IoV applications, discussing their frameworks, key features, and performance evaluation in terms of privacy, utility, and efficiency. Finally, we identify current challenges and propose future research directions to enhance privacy and reliability in IoV applications.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional map matching-based localization methods solve the poses by explicitly matching map elements with sensor observations, generally sensitive to perception noise, therefore requiring costly hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end localization neural network which directly estimates vehicle poses from surrounding images, without explicitly matching perception results with HD maps. To ensure efficiency and interpretability, a decoupled BEV neural matching-based pose solver is proposed, which estimates poses in a differentiable sampling-based matching module. Moreover, the sampling space is hugely reduced by decoupling the feature representation affected by each DoF of poses. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network is capable of performing decimeter level localization with mean absolute errors of 0.19m, 0.13m and 0.39 degree in longitudinal, lateral position and yaw angle while exhibiting a 68.8% reduction in inference memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

However, traditional approaches rely on either regressionbased models, which provide precise control but lack confidence estimation, or classification-based models, which offer confidence scores but suffer from reduced precision due to discretization. This limitation makes it challenging to quantify the reliability of predicted actions and apply corrections when necessary. In this work, we introduce a dual-head neural network architecture that integrates both regression and classification heads to improve decision reliability in imitation learning. The regression head predicts continuous driving actions, while the classification head estimates confidence, enabling a correction mechanism that adjusts actions in low-confidence scenarios, enhancing driving stability. We evaluate our approach in a closed-loop setting within the CARLA simulator, demonstrating its ability to detect uncertain actions, estimate confidence, and apply real-time corrections. Experimental results show that our method reduces lane deviation and improves trajectory accuracy by up to 50%, outperforming conventional regression-only models. These findings highlight the potential of classification-guided confidence estimation in enhancing the robustness of vision-based imitation learning for autonomous driving.

However, effectively integrating these methods into the automotive development lifecycle remains challenging. Since the performance of machine learning algorithms relies heavily on the training data provided, the data and model development lifecycle play a key role in successfully integrating these components into the product development lifecycle. Existing models frequently encounter difficulties recognizing or adapting to novel instances not present in the original training dataset. This poses a significant risk for reliable deployment in dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive neural network architecture and an iterative development framework that enables users to efficiently incorporate previously unknown objects into the current perception system. Our approach builds on continuous learning, emphasizing the necessity of dynamic updates to reflect real-world deployment conditions. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline with three key components: (1) a scalable network extension strategy to integrate new classes while preserving existing performance, (2) a dynamic OoD detection component that requires no additional retraining for newly added classes, and (3) a retrieval-based data augmentation process tailored for safety-critical deployments. The integration of these components establishes a pragmatic and adaptive pipeline for the continuous evolution of perception systems in the context of autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> | None |

To address these challenges, commencing with the representation of state-action mapping in the end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm, we introduce a novel pipeline, VDT-Auto. Leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of Visual Language Model (VLM), incorporating with diffusion Transformer-based action generation, our VDT-Auto parses the environment geometrically and contextually for the conditioning of the diffusion process. Geometrically, we use a bird's-eye view (BEV) encoder to extract feature grids from the surrounding images. Contextually, the structured output of our fine-tuned VLM is processed into textual embeddings and noisy paths. During our diffusion process, the added noise for the forward process is sampled from the noisy path output of the fine-tuned VLM, while the extracted BEV feature grids and embedded texts condition the reverse process of our diffusion Transformers. Our VDT-Auto achieved 0.52m on average L2 errors and 21% on average collision rate in the nuScenes open-loop planning evaluation. Moreover, the real-world demonstration exhibited prominent generalizability of our VDT-Auto. The code and dataset will be released after acceptance.</p></details> | Submitted paper | None |

To avoid the difficulty of modeling highly complex dynamics and ensuring realtime control feasibility and performance, this work uses deep reinforcement learning with a model predictive controller in a cooperative framework to handle unknown dynamics. The model-based controller takes on the primary role as both controllers are provided with predictive information about the other. This improves tracking performance and retention of inherent robustness of the model predictive controller. We evaluate this framework for off-road autonomous driving on unknown deformable terrains that represent sandy deformable soil, sandy and rocky soil, and cohesive clay-like deformable soil. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers by upto 29.2% and 10.2%. This framework generalized well over varied and previously unseen terrain characteristics to track longitudinal reference speeds with lower errors. Furthermore, this required significantly less training data compared to purely learning-based controller, while delivering better performance even when under-trained.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted at 2025 IEEE ICRA</p></details> | None |

This reliance necessitates expensive annotations and constrains deployment and data scalability in real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce SSR, a novel framework that utilizes only 16 navigation-guided tokens as Sparse Scene Representation, efficiently extracting crucial scene information for E2EAD. Our method eliminates the need for human-designed supervised sub-tasks, allowing computational resources to concentrate on essential elements directly related to navigation intent.

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.</p></details> | Technical report | None |

However, removing all temporarily static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street. StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed, partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further applications.

The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can process both visual and textual data, presents an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning tasks within a single framework. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a novel framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving systems by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce the Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss function, designed to improve the accuracy of low-level control signal predictions when numerical values are represented as text. Second, to ensure safe autonomous driving by explicitly integrating precise safety knowledge into the MLLM, we develop a reasoning component for SafeAuto. This component translates driving safety regulations into first-order logic rules (e.g., "red light => stop") and incorporates these rules into a probabilistic graphical model, such as a Markov Logic Network (MLN). The MLN is trained to verify the predicted next actions using environmental attributes identified by attribute recognition models (e.g., detecting a red light) to form the predicates. Additionally, we construct a Multimodal RAG model that leverages video data, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn more effectively from past similar driving experiences. By integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets. This advancement enables more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving systems that learn from experience, obey traffic laws, and perform precise control actions.</p></details> |  | None |

The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However, their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential. This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world environments.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components.

| **[Dynamically Local-Enhancement Planner for Large-Scale Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21134v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous vehicles operate primarily within limited regions, but there is increasing demand for broader applications. However, as models scale, their limited capacity becomes a significant challenge for adapting to novel scenarios. It is increasingly difficult to improve models for new situations using a single monolithic model. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of dynamically enhancing a basic driving planner with local driving data, without permanently modifying the planner itself. This approach, termed the Dynamically Local-Enhancement (DLE) Planner, aims to improve the scalability of autonomous driving systems without significantly expanding the planner's size. Our approach introduces a position-varying Markov Decision Process formulation coupled with a graph neural network that extracts region-specific driving features from local observation data. The learned features describe the local behavior of the surrounding objects, which is then leveraged to enhance a basic reinforcement learning-based policy. We evaluated our approach in multiple scenarios and compared it with a one-for-all driving model. The results show that our method outperforms the baseline policy in both safety (collision rate) and average reward, while maintaining a lighter scale. This approach has the potential to benefit large-scale autonomous vehicles without the need for largely expanding on-device driving models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AuthSim: Towards Authentic and Effective Safety-critical Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21100v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating adversarial safety-critical scenarios is a pivotal method for testing autonomous driving systems, as it identifies potential weaknesses and enhances system robustness and reliability. However, existing approaches predominantly emphasize unrestricted collision scenarios, prompting non-player character (NPC) vehicles to attack the ego vehicle indiscriminately. These works overlook these scenarios' authenticity, rationality, and relevance, resulting in numerous extreme, contrived, and largely unrealistic collision events involving aggressive NPC vehicles. To rectify this issue, we propose a three-layer relative safety region model, which partitions the area based on danger levels and increases the likelihood of NPC vehicles entering relative boundary regions. This model directs NPC vehicles to engage in adversarial actions within relatively safe boundary regions, thereby augmenting the scenarios' authenticity. We introduce AuthSim, a comprehensive platform for generating authentic and effective safety-critical scenarios by integrating the three-layer relative safety region model with reinforcement learning. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the authenticity and effectiveness of autonomous driving system test scenarios comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AuthSim outperforms existing methods in generating effective safety-critical scenarios. Notably, AuthSim achieves a 5.25% improvement in average cut-in distance and a 27.12% enhancement in average collision interval time, while maintaining higher efficiency in generating effective safety-critical scenarios compared to existing methods. This underscores its significant advantage in producing authentic scenarios over current methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional GNSS-based localization methods suffer from signal occlusion and multipath effects in urban environments. Meanwhile, methods relying on high-definition (HD) maps are constrained by the high costs associated with the construction and maintenance of HD maps. Standard-definition (SD) maps-based methods, on the other hand, often exhibit unsatisfactory performance or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SegLocNet, a multimodal GNSS-free localization network that achieves precise localization using bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. SegLocNet employs a BEV segmentation network to generate semantic maps from multiple sensor inputs, followed by an exhaustive matching process to estimate the vehicle's ego pose. This approach avoids the limitations of regression-based pose estimation and maintains high interpretability and generalization. By introducing a unified map representation, our method can be applied to both HD and SD maps without any modifications to the network architecture, thereby balancing localization accuracy and area coverage. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and that our method can accurately estimate the ego pose in urban environments without relying on GNSS, while maintaining strong generalization ability. Our code and pre-trained model will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

This paper proposes a novel approach for just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) in autonomous driving software systems using multimodal learning. The proposed model leverages the multimodal transformers in which the pre-trained transformers and a combining module deal with the multiple data modalities of the software system datasets such as code features, change metrics, and contextual information. The key point for adapting multimodal learning is to utilize the attention mechanism between the different data modalities such as text, numerical, and categorical. In the combining module, the output of a transformer model on text data and tabular features containing categorical and numerical data are combined to produce the predictions using the fully connected layers. Experiments conducted on three open-source autonomous driving system software projects collected from the GitHub repository (Apollo, Carla, and Donkeycar) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models regarding evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning to enhance the reliability and safety of autonomous driving software through improved defect prediction.</p></details> | 9 | None |

This raises a crucial research question: how can we develop better scene feature representations to fully leverage sensor data in end-to-end driving? Self-supervised learning methods show great success in learning rich feature representations in NLP and computer vision. Inspired by this, we propose a novel self-supervised learning approach using the LAtent World model (LAW) for end-to-end driving. LAW predicts future scene features based on current features and ego trajectories. This self-supervised task can be seamlessly integrated into perception-free and perception-based frameworks, improving scene feature learning and optimizing trajectory prediction.

This is crucial for maintaining the reliability of open-world applications by identifying data distribution shifts, particularly in critical domains such as online transactions, autonomous driving, and real-time patient diagnosis. Despite the availability of numerous OOD detection methods, the challenge of selecting an optimal model for diverse tasks remains largely underexplored, especially in scenarios lacking ground truth labels. In this work, we introduce MetaOOD, the first zero-shot, unsupervised framework that utilizes meta-learning to select an OOD detection model automatically. As a meta-learning approach, MetaOOD leverages historical performance data of existing methods across various benchmark OOD detection datasets, enabling the effective selection of a suitable model for new datasets without the need for labeled data at the test time. To quantify task similarities more accurately, we introduce language model-based embeddings that capture the distinctive OOD characteristics of both datasets and detection models. Through extensive experimentation with 24 unique test dataset pairs to choose from among 11 OOD detection models, we demonstrate that MetaOOD significantly outperforms existing methods and only brings marginal time overhead. Our results, validated by Wilcoxon statistical tests, show that MetaOOD surpasses a diverse group of 11 baselines, including established OOD detectors and advanced unsupervised selection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best paper at 2024 KDD Workshop on Resource-Efficient Learning.

However, current benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate these claims, focusing only on general video quality, ignoring important factors to world models such as physics adherence. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldModelBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the world modeling capabilities of video generation models in application-driven domains. WorldModelBench offers two key advantages: (1) Against to nuanced world modeling violations: By incorporating instruction-following and physics-adherence dimensions, WorldModelBench detects subtle violations, such as irregular changes in object size that breach the mass conservation law - issues overlooked by prior benchmarks. (2) Aligned with large-scale human preferences: We crowd-source 67K human labels to accurately measure 14 frontier models. Using our high-quality human labels, we further fine-tune an accurate judger to automate the evaluation procedure, achieving 8.6% higher average accuracy in predicting world modeling violations than GPT-4o with 2B parameters. In addition, we demonstrate that training to align human annotations by maximizing the rewards from the judger noticeably improve the world modeling capability.

However, it requires laborious human efforts to annotate the point cloud for training a segmentation model. To address this challenge, we propose a YoCo framework, which generates 3D pseudo labels using minimal coarse click annotations in the bird's eye view plane. It is a significant challenge to produce high-quality pseudo labels from sparse annotations. Our YoCo framework first leverages vision foundation models combined with geometric constraints from point clouds to enhance pseudo label generation. Second, a temporal and spatial-based label updating module is designed to generate reliable updated labels. It leverages predictions from adjacent frames and utilizes the inherent density variation of point clouds (dense near, sparse far). Finally, to further improve label quality, an IoU-guided enhancement module is proposed, replacing pseudo labels with high-confidence and high-IoU predictions. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate YoCo's effectiveness and generality, achieving state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised methods and surpassing fully supervised Cylinder3D. Additionally, the YoCo is suitable for various networks, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised methods with minimal fine-tuning using only 0.8% of the fully labeled data, significantly reducing annotation costs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RMP-SAM: Towards Real-Time Multi-Purpose Segment Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10228v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent segmentation methods, which adopt large-scale data training and transformer architecture, aim to create one foundation model that can perform multiple tasks. However, most of these methods rely on heavy encoder and decoder frameworks, hindering their performance in real-time scenarios. To explore real-time segmentation, recent advancements primarily focus on semantic segmentation within specific environments, such as autonomous driving. However, they often overlook the generalization ability of these models across diverse scenarios. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work explores a novel real-time segmentation setting called real-time multi-purpose segmentation. It contains three fundamental sub-tasks: interactive segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and video instance segmentation. Unlike previous methods, which use a specific design for each task, we aim to use only a single end-to-end model to accomplish all these tasks in real-time. To meet real-time requirements and balance multi-task learning, we present a novel dynamic convolution-based method, Real-Time Multi-Purpose SAM (RMP-SAM). It contains an efficient encoder and an efficient decoupled adapter to perform prompt-driven decoding. Moreover, we further explore different training strategies and one new adapter design to boost co-training performance further. We benchmark several strong baselines by extending existing works to support our multi-purpose segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMP-SAM is effective and generalizes well on proposed benchmarks and other specific semantic tasks. Our implementation of RMP-SAM achieves the optimal balance between accuracy and speed for these tasks.Our code and model are available at https://github.com/xushilin1/RAP-SAM/.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR-...</summary><p>ICLR-2025 (oral).

Although sophisticated 3D object detection and tracking methods have been investigated and developed thoroughly in the fields of computer vision and autonomous driving, their demands on expensive and high-accuracy sensor setups and substantial computational resources from large neural networks make them unsuitable for indoor robotics. Recently, more lightweight perception algorithms leveraging onboard cameras or LiDAR sensors have emerged as promising alternatives. However, relying on a single sensor poses significant limitations: cameras have limited fields of view and can suffer from high noise, whereas LiDAR sensors operate at lower frequencies and lack the richness of visual features. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic obstacle detection and tracking framework that uses both onboard camera and LiDAR data to enable lightweight and accurate perception. Our proposed method expands on our previous ensemble detection approach, which integrates outputs from multiple low-accuracy but computationally efficient detectors to ensure real-time performance on the onboard computer. In this work, we propose a more robust fusion strategy that integrates both LiDAR and visual data to enhance detection accuracy further. We then utilize a tracking module that adopts feature-based object association and the Kalman filter to track and estimate detected obstacles' states. Besides, a dynamic obstacle classification algorithm is designed to robustly identify moving objects. The dataset evaluation demonstrates a better perception performance compared to benchmark methods. The physical experiments on a quadcopter robot confirms the feasibility for real-world navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Unfortunately, the availability of high-quality training can be limited for specialized tasks, such as high performance racing. Several recent works have leveraged AI-assistance to improve instruction of tasks ranging from rehabilitation to surgical robot tele-operation. However, these works often make simplifying assumptions on the student learning process, and fail to model how a teacher's assistance interacts with different individuals' abilities when determining optimal teaching strategies. Inspired by the idea of scaffolding from educational psychology, we leverage shared autonomy, a framework for combining user inputs with robot autonomy, to aid with curriculum design. Our key insight is that the way a student's behavior improves in the presence of assistance from an autonomous agent can highlight which sub-skills might be most ``learnable'' for the student, or within their Zone of Proximal Development. We use this to design Z-COACH, a method for using shared autonomy to provide personalized instruction targeting interpretable task sub-skills. In a user study (n=50), where we teach high performance racing in a simulated environment of the Thunderhill Raceway Park with the CARLA Autonomous Driving simulator, we show that Z-COACH helps identify which skills each student should first practice, leading to an overall improvement in driving time, behavior, and smoothness. Our work shows that increasingly available semi-autonomous capabilities (e.g. in vehicles, robots) can not only assist human users, but also help *teach* them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional 3D tracking systems are typically constrained by predefined object categories, limiting their adaptability to novel, unseen objects in dynamic environments.

However, depth ambiguity poses a significant challenge, as it requires extracting precise 3D scene geometry from a single image, resulting in suboptimal performance when transferring knowledge from a LiDAR-based teacher model to a camera-based student model.

However, such representation necessitates cross-view overlap for accurate depth estimation, and is challenged by object occlusions and frustum truncations. As a result, these methods require scene-centric data acquisition to maintain cross-view overlap and complete scene visibility to circumvent occlusions and truncations, which limits their applicability to scene-centric reconstruction. In contrast, in autonomous driving scenarios, a more practical paradigm is ego-centric reconstruction, which is characterized by minimal cross-view overlap and frequent occlusions and truncations. The limitations of pixel-based representation thus hinder the utility of prior works in this task. In light of this, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of different representations, and introduces Omni-Gaussian representation with tailored network design to complement their strengths and mitigate their drawbacks. Experiments show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, pixelSplat and MVSplat, in ego-centric reconstruction, and achieves comparable performance to prior works in scene-centric reconstruction.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | None |

BEVDiffuser can be operated in a plug-and-play manner during training time to enhance existing BEV models without requiring any architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate BEVDiffuser's exceptional denoising and generation capabilities, which enable significant enhancement to existing BEV models, as evidenced by notable improvements of 12.3\% in mAP and 10.1\% in NDS achieved for 3D object detection without introducing additional computational complexity.

While these systems integrate a variety of technologies and offer numerous benefits, their security is paramount, as vulnerabilities can have severe consequences for safety and trust. This study aims to systematically investigate potential security weaknesses in the codebases of prominent open-source ADS projects using CodeQL, a static code analysis tool. The goal is to identify common vulnerabilities, their distribution and persistence across versions to enhance the security of ADS. We selected three representative open-source ADS projects, Autoware, AirSim, and Apollo, based on their high GitHub star counts and Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities. Using CodeQL, we analyzed multiple versions of these projects to identify vulnerabilities, focusing on CWE categories such as CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). We also tracked the lifecycle of these vulnerabilities across software versions. This approach allows us to systematically analyze vulnerabilities in projects, which has not been extensively explored in previous ADS research. Our analysis revealed that specific CWE categories, particularly CWE-190 (59.6%) and CWE-20 (16.1%), were prevalent across the selected ADS projects. These vulnerabilities often persisted for over six months, spanning multiple version iterations. The empirical assessment showed a direct link between the severity of these vulnerabilities and their tangible effects on ADS performance. These security issues among ADS still remain to be resolved. Our findings highlight the need for integrating static code analysis into ADS development to detect and mitigate common vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in Information and Software Technology, 2025</p></details> | None |

Recently, advanced multi-modal methods incorporating camera information have achieved notable performance. For a safe and effective autonomous driving system, algorithms that excel not only in accuracy but also in speed and low latency are essential. However, existing algorithms fail to meet these requirements due to the latency and bandwidth limitations of fixed frame rate sensors, e.g., LiDAR and camera. To address this limitation, we introduce asynchronous event cameras into 3D object detection for the first time. We leverage their high temporal resolution and low bandwidth to enable high-speed 3D object detection. Our method enables detection even during inter-frame intervals when synchronized data is unavailable, by retrieving previous 3D information through the event camera.
