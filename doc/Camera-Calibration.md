| **[Supervised Visual Docking Network for Unmanned Surface Vehicles Using Auto-labeling in Real-world Water Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03282v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are increasingly applied to water operations such as environmental monitoring and river-map modeling. It faces a significant challenge in achieving precise autonomous docking at ports or stations, still relying on remote human control or external positioning systems for accuracy and safety which limits the full potential of human-out-of-loop deployment for USVs.This paper introduces a novel supervised learning pipeline with the auto-labeling technique for USVs autonomous visual docking. Firstly, we designed an auto-labeling data collection pipeline that appends relative pose and image pair to the dataset. This step does not require conventional manual labeling for supervised learning. Secondly, the Neural Dock Pose Estimator (NDPE) is proposed to achieve relative dock pose prediction without the need for hand-crafted feature engineering, camera calibration, and peripheral markers. Moreover, The NDPE can accurately predict the relative dock pose in real-world water environments, facilitating the implementation of Position-Based Visual Servo (PBVS) and low-level motion controllers for efficient and autonomous docking.Experiments show that the NDPE is robust to the disturbance of the distance and the USV velocity. The effectiveness of our proposed solution is tested and validated in real-world water environments, reflecting its capability to handle real-world autonomous docking tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> | None |
| **[MUSt3R: Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01661v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DUSt3R introduced a novel paradigm in geometric computer vision by proposing a model that can provide dense and unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections with no prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. Under the hood, however, DUSt3R processes image pairs, regressing local 3D reconstructions that need to be aligned in a global coordinate system. The number of pairs, growing quadratically, is an inherent limitation that becomes especially concerning for robust and fast optimization in the case of large image collections. In this paper, we propose an extension of DUSt3R from pairs to multiple views, that addresses all aforementioned concerns. Indeed, we propose a Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction, or MUSt3R, that modifies the DUSt3R architecture by making it symmetric and extending it to directly predict 3D structure for all views in a common coordinate frame. Second, we entail the model with a multi-layer memory mechanism which allows to reduce the computational complexity and to scale the reconstruction to large collections, inferring thousands of 3D pointmaps at high frame-rates with limited added complexity. The framework is designed to perform 3D reconstruction both offline and online, and hence can be seamlessly applied to SfM and visual SLAM scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance on various 3D downstream tasks, including uncalibrated Visual Odometry, relative camera pose, scale and focal estimation, 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Blind Augmentation: Calibration-free Camera Distortion Model Estimation for Real-time Mixed-reality Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01387v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real camera footage is subject to noise, motion blur (MB) and depth of field (DoF). In some applications these might be considered distortions to be removed, but in others it is important to model them because it would be ineffective, or interfere with an aesthetic choice, to simply remove them. In augmented reality applications where virtual content is composed into a live video feed, we can model noise, MB and DoF to make the virtual content visually consistent with the video. Existing methods for this typically suffer two main limitations. First, they require a camera calibration step to relate a known calibration target to the specific cameras response. Second, existing work require methods that can be (differentiably) tuned to the calibration, such as slow and specialized neural networks. We propose a method which estimates parameters for noise, MB and DoF instantly, which allows using off-the-shelf real-time simulation methods from e.g., a game engine in compositing augmented content. Our main idea is to unlock both features by showing how to use modern computer vision methods that can remove noise, MB and DoF from the video stream, essentially providing self-calibration. This allows to auto-tune any black-box real-time noise+MB+DoF method to deliver fast and high-fidelity augmentation consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (IEEEVR 2025).

| **[High-precision visual navigation device calibration method based on collimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18012v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation devices require precise calibration to achieve high-precision localization and navigation, which includes camera and attitude calibration. To address the limitations of time-consuming camera calibration and complex attitude adjustment processes, this study presents a collimator-based calibration method and system. Based on the optical characteristics of the collimator, a single-image camera calibration algorithm is introduced. In addition, integrated with the precision adjustment mechanism of the calibration frame, a rotation transfer model between coordinate systems enables efficient attitude calibration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy and stability comparable to traditional multi-image calibration techniques. Specifically, the re-projection errors are less than 0.1463 pixels, and average attitude angle errors are less than 0.0586 degrees with a standard deviation less than 0.0257 degrees, demonstrating high precision and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Learning for Camera Calibration and Beyond: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10559v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera calibration involves estimating camera parameters to infer geometric features from captured sequences, which is crucial for computer vision and robotics. However, conventional calibration is laborious and requires dedicated collection. Recent efforts show that learning-based solutions have the potential to be used in place of the repeatability works of manual calibrations. Among these solutions, various learning strategies, networks, geometric priors, and datasets have been investigated. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of learning-based camera calibration techniques, by analyzing their strengths and limitations. Our main calibration categories include the standard pinhole camera model, distortion camera model, cross-view model, and cross-sensor model, following the research trend and extended applications. As there is no unified benchmark in this community, we collect a holistic calibration dataset that can serve as a public platform to evaluate the generalization of existing methods. It comprises both synthetic and real-world data, with images and videos captured by different cameras in diverse scenes. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide further research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first survey for the learning-based camera calibration (spanned 10 years).

| **[Spatiotemporal Multi-Camera Calibration using Freely Moving People](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12546v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for spatiotemporal multi-camera calibration using freely moving people in multiview videos. Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[PTZ-Calib: Robust Pan-Tilt-Zoom Camera Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09075v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present PTZ-Calib, a robust two-stage PTZ camera calibration method, that efficiently and accurately estimates camera parameters for arbitrary viewpoints. Our method includes an offline and an online stage. In the offline stage, we first uniformly select a set of reference images that sufficiently overlap to encompass a complete 360{\deg} view. We then utilize the novel PTZ-IBA (PTZ Incremental Bundle Adjustment) algorithm to automatically calibrate the cameras within a local coordinate system. Additionally, for practical application, we can further optimize camera parameters and align them with the geographic coordinate system using extra global reference 3D information. In the online stage, we formulate the calibration of any new viewpoints as a relocalization problem. Our approach balances the accuracy and computational efficiency to meet real-world demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our robustness and superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on various real and synthetic datasets.

| **[CoL3D: Collaborative Learning of Single-view Depth and Camera Intrinsics for Metric 3D Shape Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08902v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering the metric 3D shape from a single image is particularly relevant for robotics and embodied intelligence applications, where accurate spatial understanding is crucial for navigation and interaction with environments. Usually, the mainstream approaches achieve it through monocular depth estimation. However, without camera intrinsics, the 3D metric shape can not be recovered from depth alone. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that depth serves as a 3D prior constraint for estimating camera intrinsics and uncover the reciprocal relations between these two elements. Motivated by this, we propose a collaborative learning framework for jointly estimating depth and camera intrinsics, named CoL3D, to learn metric 3D shapes from single images. Specifically, CoL3D adopts a unified network and performs collaborative optimization at three levels: depth, camera intrinsics, and 3D point clouds. For camera intrinsics, we design a canonical incidence field mechanism as a prior that enables the model to learn the residual incident field for enhanced calibration. Additionally, we incorporate a shape similarity measurement loss in the point cloud space, which improves the quality of 3D shapes essential for robotic applications. As a result, when training and testing on a single dataset with in-domain settings, CoL3D delivers outstanding performance in both depth estimation and camera calibration across several indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets, which leads to remarkable 3D shape quality for the perception capabilities of robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Automatic Calibration of a Multi-Camera System with Limited Overlapping Fields of View for 3D Surgical Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16221v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The purpose of this study is to develop an automated and accurate external camera calibration method for multi-camera systems used in 3D surgical scene reconstruction (3D-SSR), eliminating the need for operator intervention or specialized expertise. The method specifically addresses the problem of limited overlapping fields of view caused by significant variations in optical zoom levels and camera locations. We contribute a novel, fast, and fully automatic calibration method based on the projection of multi-scale markers (MSMs) using a ceiling-mounted projector. MSMs consist of 2D patterns projected at varying scales, ensuring accurate extraction of well distributed point correspondences across significantly different viewpoints and zoom levels. Validation is performed using both synthetic and real data captured in a mock-up OR, with comparisons to traditional manual marker-based methods as well as markerless calibration methods. The method achieves accuracy comparable to manual, operator-dependent calibration methods while exhibiting higher robustness under conditions of significant differences in zoom levels. Additionally, we show that state-of-the-art Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines are ineffective in 3D-SSR settings, even when additional texture is projected onto the OR floor. The use of a ceiling-mounted entry-level projector proves to be an effective alternative to operator-dependent, traditional marker-based methods, paving the way for fully automated 3D-SSR.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[What Really Matters for Learning-based LiDAR-Camera Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16969v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calibration is an essential prerequisite for the accurate data fusion of LiDAR and camera sensors. Traditional calibration techniques often require specific targets or suitable scenes to obtain reliable 2D-3D correspondences. To tackle the challenge of target-less and online calibration, deep neural networks have been introduced to solve the problem in a data-driven manner. While previous learning-based methods have achieved impressive performance on specific datasets, they still struggle in complex real-world scenarios. Most existing works focus on improving calibration accuracy but overlook the underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we revisit the development of learning-based LiDAR-Camera calibration and encourage the community to pay more attention to the underlying principles to advance practical applications. We systematically analyze the paradigm of mainstream learning-based methods, and identify the critical limitations of regression-based methods with the widely used data generation pipeline. Our findings reveal that most learning-based methods inadvertently operate as retrieval networks, focusing more on single-modality distributions rather than cross-modality correspondences. We also investigate how the input data format and preprocessing operations impact network performance and summarize the regression clues to inform further improvements.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep-BrownConrady: Prediction of Camera Calibration and Distortion Parameters Using Deep Learning and Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14510v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research addresses the challenge of camera calibration and distortion parameter prediction from a single image using deep learning models. The main contributions of this work are: (1) demonstrating that a deep learning model, trained on a mix of real and synthetic images, can accurately predict camera and lens parameters from a single image, and (2) developing a comprehensive synthetic dataset using the AILiveSim simulation platform. This dataset includes variations in focal length and lens distortion parameters, providing a robust foundation for model training and testing. The training process predominantly relied on these synthetic images, complemented by a small subset of real images, to explore how well models trained on synthetic data can perform calibration tasks on real-world images. Traditional calibration methods require multiple images of a calibration object from various orientations, which is often not feasible due to the lack of such images in publicly available datasets. A deep learning network based on the ResNet architecture was trained on this synthetic dataset to predict camera calibration parameters following the Brown-Conrady lens model. The ResNet architecture, adapted for regression tasks, is capable of predicting continuous values essential for accurate camera calibration in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

Addressing the lack of review papers in the field of intelligent cinematography} (IC) and the breadth of related computer vision research, we present a holistic view of the IC landscape while providing technical insight, important for experts across disciplines.

In the final chapter, we address the greater scope of IC research and summarize the significant potential of this area to influence the creative industries sector. We suggest that work relating to virtual production has the greatest potential to impact other mediums of production, driven by the growing interest in LED volumes/stages for in-camera virtual effects (ICVFX) and automated 3-D capture for virtual modeling of real world scenes and actors. We also address ethical and legal concerns regarding the use of creative AI that impact on artists, actors, technologists and the general public.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication with "Artificial Intelligence Review" Journal (https://link.springer.com/journal/10462) and we are in the procress of publishing it</p></details> | None |
| **[Simultaneously Recovering Multi-Person Meshes and Multi-View Cameras with Human Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18785v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic multi-person mesh recovery has broad applications in sports broadcasting, virtual reality, and video games. However, current multi-view frameworks rely on a time-consuming camera calibration procedure. In this work, we focus on multi-person motion capture with uncalibrated cameras, which mainly faces two challenges: one is that inter-person interactions and occlusions introduce inherent ambiguities for both camera calibration and motion capture; the other is that a lack of dense correspondences can be used to constrain sparse camera geometries in a dynamic multi-person scene. Our key idea is to incorporate motion prior knowledge to simultaneously estimate camera parameters and human meshes from noisy human semantics. We first utilize human information from 2D images to initialize intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Thus, the approach does not rely on any other calibration tools or background features. Then, a pose-geometry consistency is introduced to associate the detected humans from different views. Finally, a latent motion prior is proposed to refine the camera parameters and human motions. Experimental results show that accurate camera parameters and human motions can be obtained through a one-step reconstruction.

| **[LUCES-MV: A Multi-View Dataset for Near-Field Point Light Source Photometric Stereo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16737v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The biggest improvements in Photometric Stereo (PS) field has recently come from adoption of differentiable volumetric rendering techniques such as NeRF or Neural SDF achieving impressive reconstruction error of 0.2mm on DiLiGenT-MV benchmark. However, while there are sizeable datasets for environment lit objects such as Digital Twin Catalogue (DTS), there are only several small Photometric Stereo datasets which often lack challenging objects (simple, smooth, untextured) and practical, small form factor (near-field) light setup. To address this, we propose LUCES-MV, the first real-world, multi-view dataset designed for near-field point light source photometric stereo. Our dataset includes 15 objects with diverse materials, each imaged under varying light conditions from an array of 15 LEDs positioned 30 to 40 centimeters from the camera center. To facilitate transparent end-to-end evaluation, our dataset provides not only ground truth normals and ground truth object meshes and poses but also light and camera calibration images. We evaluate state-of-the-art near-field photometric stereo algorithms, highlighting their strengths and limitations across different material and shape complexities. LUCES-MV dataset offers an important benchmark for developing more robust, accurate and scalable real-world Photometric Stereo based 3D reconstruction methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MV-DUSt3R+: Single-Stage Scene Reconstruction from Sparse Views In 2 Seconds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06974v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent sparse multi-view scene reconstruction advances like DUSt3R and MASt3R no longer require camera calibration and camera pose estimation. However, they only process a pair of views at a time to infer pixel-aligned pointmaps. When dealing with more than two views, a combinatorial number of error prone pairwise reconstructions are usually followed by an expensive global optimization, which often fails to rectify the pairwise reconstruction errors. To handle more views, reduce errors, and improve inference time, we propose the fast single-stage feed-forward network MV-DUSt3R. At its core are multi-view decoder blocks which exchange information across any number of views while considering one reference view. To make our method robust to reference view selection, we further propose MV-DUSt3R+, which employs cross-reference-view blocks to fuse information across different reference view choices. To further enable novel view synthesis, we extend both by adding and jointly training Gaussian splatting heads. Experiments on multi-view stereo reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, and novel view synthesis confirm that our methods improve significantly upon prior art. Code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and tracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking (MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly handling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named BEV-SUSHI, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera calibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV). Then, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D detections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, BEV-SUSHI has impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera settings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a result, our proposed BEV-SUSHI establishes the new state-of-the-art on the AICity'24 dataset with 81.22 HOTA, and 95.6 IDF1 on the WildTrack dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

An autonomous driving system must be extremely good at detecting objects surrounding the car to ensure safety. In this paper, classification, and estimation of an object's (pedestrian) position (concerning an ego 3D coordinate system) are studied and the distance between the ego vehicle and the object in the context of autonomous driving is measured. To classify the object, faster Region-based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) with inception v2 is utilized. First, a network is trained with customized dataset to estimate the reference position of objects as well as the distance from the vehicle. From camera calibration to computing the distance, cutting-edge technologies of computer vision algorithms in a series of processes are applied to generate a 3D reference point of the region of interest. The foremost step in this process is generating a disparity map using the concept of stereo vision.</p></details> |  | None |

To contribute to such applications, the research community has typically focused on single-view calibration methods, leveraging the near-omnipresence of soccer field markings in wide-angle broadcast views, but leaving all temporal aspects, if considered at all, to general-purpose tracking or filtering techniques. Only a few contributions have been made to leverage any domain-specific knowledge for this tracking task, and, as a result, there lacks a truly performant and off-the-shelf camera tracking system tailored for soccer broadcasting, specifically for elevated tripod-mounted cameras around the stadium. In this work, we present such a system capable of addressing the task of soccer broadcast camera tracking efficiently, robustly, and accurately, outperforming by far the most precise methods of the state-of-the-art. By combining the available open-source soccer field detectors with carefully designed camera and tripod models, our tracking system, BroadTrack, halves the mean reprojection error rate and gains more than 15% in terms of Jaccard index for camera calibration on the SoccerNet dataset. Furthermore, as the SoccerNet dataset videos are relatively short (30 seconds), we also present qualitative results on a 20-minute broadcast clip to showcase the robustness and the soundness of our system.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, 60 references</p></details> | None |
| **[DUSt3R: Geometric 3D Vision Made Easy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14132v3)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view stereo reconstruction (MVS) in the wild requires to first estimate the camera parameters e.g. intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. These are usually tedious and cumbersome to obtain, yet they are mandatory to triangulate corresponding pixels in 3D space, which is the core of all best performing MVS algorithms. In this work, we take an opposite stance and introduce DUSt3R, a radically novel paradigm for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections, i.e. operating without prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. We cast the pairwise reconstruction problem as a regression of pointmaps, relaxing the hard constraints of usual projective camera models. We show that this formulation smoothly unifies the monocular and binocular reconstruction cases. In the case where more than two images are provided, we further propose a simple yet effective global alignment strategy that expresses all pairwise pointmaps in a common reference frame. We base our network architecture on standard Transformer encoders and decoders, allowing us to leverage powerful pretrained models. Our formulation directly provides a 3D model of the scene as well as depth information, but interestingly, we can seamlessly recover from it, pixel matches, relative and absolute camera. Exhaustive experiments on all these tasks showcase that the proposed DUSt3R can unify various 3D vision tasks and set new SoTAs on monocular/multi-view depth estimation as well as relative pose estimation. In summary, DUSt3R makes many geometric 3D vision tasks easy.</p></details> | <details><summary>fixin...</summary><p>fixing the ref for StaticThings3D dataset</p></details> | None |

However, the tracking performance still lacks behind traditional and end-to-end SLAM systems. An optimal trade-off between robustness, speed and accuracy has not yet been reached, especially for monocular video. In this paper, we introduce a SLAM system based on an end-to-end Tracker and extend it with a Renderer based on recent 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques. Our framework \textbf{DroidSplat} achieves both SotA tracking and rendering results on common SLAM benchmarks. We implemented multiple building blocks of modern SLAM systems to run in parallel, allowing for fast inference on common consumer GPU's. Recent progress in monocular depth prediction and camera calibration allows our system to achieve strong results even on in-the-wild data without known camera intrinsics.

While these tasks rely heavily on known camera poses, the problem of finding such poses using structure-from-motion (SfM) often depends on robustly separating static from dynamic parts of a video. The lack of a robust solution to this problem limits the performance of SfM camera-calibration pipelines. We propose a novel approach to video-based motion segmentation to identify the components of a scene that are moving w.r.t. a fixed world frame. Our simple but effective iterative method, RoMo, combines optical flow and epipolar cues with a pre-trained video segmentation model. It outperforms unsupervised baselines for motion segmentation as well as supervised baselines trained from synthetic data. More importantly, the combination of an off-the-shelf SfM pipeline with our segmentation masks establishes a new state-of-the-art on camera calibration for scenes with dynamic content, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  | None |

Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad benefits to 3D vision tasks.

Unlike previous approaches, PreF3R removes the need for camera calibration and reconstructs the 3D Gaussian field within a canonical coordinate frame directly from a sequence of unposed images, enabling efficient novel-view rendering. We leverage DUSt3R's ability for pair-wise 3D structure reconstruction, and extend it to sequential multi-view input via a spatial memory network, eliminating the need for optimization-based global alignment. Additionally, PreF3R incorporates a dense Gaussian parameter prediction head, which enables subsequent novel-view synthesis with differentiable rasterization. This allows supervising our model with the combination of photometric loss and pointmap regression loss, enhancing both photorealism and structural accuracy. Given a sequence of ordered images, PreF3R incrementally reconstructs the 3D Gaussian field at 20 FPS, therefore enabling real-time novel-view rendering. Empirical experiments demonstrate that PreF3R is an effective solution for the challenging task of pose-free feed-forward novel-view synthesis, while also exhibiting robust generalization to unseen scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/PreF3R/</p></details> | None |

However, robotic applications often face challenges such as motion blur, insufficient illumination, and high computational overhead, which adversely affect downstream tasks like navigation, inspection, and scene visualization. To address these challenges, we propose E-3DGS, a novel event-based approach that partitions events into motion (from camera or object movement) and exposure (from camera exposure), using the former to handle fast-motion scenes and using the latter to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We introduce a novel integration of 3DGS with exposure events for high-quality reconstruction of explicit scene representations. Our versatile framework can operate on motion events alone for 3D reconstruction, enhance quality using exposure events, or adopt a hybrid mode that balances quality and effectiveness by optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. We also introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method is faster and delivers better reconstruction quality than event-based NeRF while being more cost-effective than NeRF methods that combine event and RGB data by using a single event sensor. By combining motion and exposure events, E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands.

However, in many real-world applications, the more advanced challenge lies in inverse rendering, which seeks to derive the physical properties of a scene, including light, geometry, textures, and materials. Meshes, as a traditional representation adopted by many simulation pipeline, however, still show limited influence in radiance field for inverse rendering. This paper introduces a novel framework called Triangle Patchlet (abbr. Triplet), a mesh-based representation, to comprehensively approximate these scene parameters. We begin by assembling Triplets with either randomly generated points or sparse points obtained from camera calibration where all faces are treated as an independent element. Next, we simulate the physical interaction of light and optimize the scene parameters using traditional graphics rendering techniques like rasterization and ray tracing, accompanying with density control and propagation. An iterative mesh extracting process is also suggested, where we continue to optimize on geometry and materials with graph-based operation. We also introduce several regulation terms to enable better generalization of materials property. Our framework could precisely estimate the light, materials and geometry with mesh without prior of light, materials and geometry in a unified framework. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while reconstructing high-quality geometry and accurate material properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/RANDO11199/Triplet</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/RANDO11199/Triplet) |

Most of these devices work by translating visual information into voice commands. In complex scenarios where multiple objects are present, it is imperative to prioritize object detection and provide immediate notifications for key entities in specific directions. This brings the need for identifying the observer's motion direction (ego-motion) by merely processing visual information, which is the key contribution of this paper. Specifically, we introduce Motor Focus, a lightweight image-based framework that predicts the ego-motion - the humans (and humanoid machines) movement intentions based on their visual feeds, while filtering out camera motion without any camera calibration. To this end, we implement an optical flow-based pixel-wise temporal analysis method to compensate for the camera motion with a Gaussian aggregation to smooth out the movement prediction area. Subsequently, to evaluate the performance, we collect a dataset including 50 clips of pedestrian scenes in 5 different scenarios. We tested this framework with classical feature detectors such as SIFT and ORB to show the comparison. Our framework demonstrates its superiority in speed (> 40FPS), accuracy (MAE = 60pixels), and robustness (SNR = 23dB), confirming its potential to enhance the usability of vision-based assistive navigation tools in complex environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, obtaining a sufficient number of high-quality point pairs remains a significant challenge for both traditional and deep learning-based calibration methods. This paper introduces a multi-stage pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging the structural features of the football pitch. Our approach significantly increases the number of usable points for calibration by exploiting line-line and line-conic intersections, points on the conics, and other geometric features. To mitigate the impact of imperfect annotations, we employ data fitting techniques. Our pipeline utilizes deep learning for keypoint and line detection and incorporates geometric constraints based on real-world pitch dimensions. A voter algorithm iteratively selects the most reliable keypoints, further enhancing calibration accuracy. We evaluated our approach on the largest football broadcast camera calibration dataset available, and secured the top position in the SoccerNet Camera Calibration Challenge 2023 [arXiv:2309.06006], which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

The system was implemented using traditional computer vision techniques, focusing on robustness and efficiency to operate in real-time, even under adverse conditions such as worn-out lanes and weather variations. The methodology employs an image processing pipeline that includes camera calibration, distortion correction, perspective transformation, and binary image generation. Lane detection is performed using sliding window techniques and segmentation based on gradients and color channels, enabling the precise identification of lanes in various road scenarios. The results indicate that the system can effectively detect and track lanes, performing well under different lighting conditions and road surfaces.

However, the standard approach based on checkerboard calibration patterns has some drawbacks that limit its applicability. For example, the calibration pattern must be completely visible without any occlusions. Alternative solutions such as ChArUco boards allow partial occlusions, but require a higher camera resolution due to the fine details of the position encoding. We present a new calibration pattern that combines the advantages of checkerboard calibration patterns with a lightweight position coding that can be decoded at very low resolutions. The decoding algorithm includes error correction and is computationally efficient. The whole approach is backward compatible to both checkerboard calibration patterns and several checkerboard calibration algorithms. Furthermore, the method can be used not only for camera calibration but also for camera pose estimation and marker-based object localization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR) 2024.

In practical scenarios with a long working distance to cover a wide area, target-based calibration methods become complicated and inflexible due to site limitations. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a collimator system, which can provide a reliable and controllable calibration environment for cameras with varying working distances. Based on the optical geometry of the collimator system, we prove that the relative motion between the target and camera conforms to the spherical motion model, reducing the original 6DOF relative motion to 3DOF pure rotation motion. Furthermore, a closed-form solver for multiple views and a minimal solver for two views are proposed for camera calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

Our system utilizes a mobile wireless communication tag attached to personal belongings as proof of opt-in and as a means of localizing tag carriers in video footage. Specifically, the on-ground positions of the wireless tag are first tracked over time using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The tag trajectory is then matched against visual tracking results for pedestrians found in videos to identify the tag carrier. Technically, we devise a dedicated trajectory matching technique based on constrained linear optimization, as well as a novel calibration technique that handles wireless tag-camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning for the UKF, which mitigates the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) issue in wireless localization. We realize the proposed opt-in camera system using ultra-wideband (UWB) devices and an off-the-shelf webcam installed in the environment.

While the state-of-the-art SfM pipelines have reached a high level of maturity in well-textured and well-configured scenes over the last decades, they still fall short of robustly solving the SfM problem in challenging scenarios. In particular, weakly textured scenes and poorly constrained configurations oftentimes cause catastrophic failures or large errors for the primarily keypoint-based pipelines. In these scenarios, line segments are often abundant and can offer complementary geometric constraints. Their large spatial extent and typically structured configurations lead to stronger geometric constraints as compared to traditional keypoint-based methods. In this work, we introduce an incremental SfM system that, in addition to points, leverages lines and their structured geometric relations. Our technical contributions span the entire pipeline (mapping, triangulation, registration) and we integrate these into a comprehensive end-to-end SfM system that we share as an open-source software with the community. We also present the first analytical method to propagate uncertainties for 3D optimized lines via sensitivity analysis. Experiments show that our system is consistently more robust and accurate compared to the widely used point-based state of the art in SfM -- achieving richer maps and more precise camera registrations, especially under challenging conditions. In addition, our uncertainty-aware localization module alone is able to consistently improve over the state of the art under both point-alone and hybrid setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables.

However, accurate and robust angle estimation from fisheye images in the Manhattan world has remained an open challenge because general scene images tend to lack constraints such as lines, arcs, and vanishing points. To achieve higher accuracy and robustness, we propose a learning-based calibration method that uses heatmap regression, which is similar to pose estimation using keypoints, to detect the directions of labeled image coordinates. Simultaneously, our two estimators recover the rotation and remove fisheye distortion by remapping from a general scene image. Without considering vanishing-point constraints, we find that additional points for learning-based methods can be defined. To compensate for the lack of vanishing points in images, we introduce auxiliary diagonal points that have the optimal 3D arrangement of spatial uniformity.

Unlike frame cameras (RGB or Multispectral), many hyperspectral sensors use a linear array or 'push-broom' scanning design. This design presents significant challenges for image rectification and the calibration of the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Typically, methods employed to address such tasks rely on a precise GPS/INS estimate of the airborne platform trajectory and a detailed terrain model. However, inaccuracies in the trajectory or surface model information can introduce systematic errors and complicate geometric modeling which ultimately degrade the quality of the rectification. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method for tie point extraction and camera calibration for 'push-broom' hyperspectral sensors using only the raw spectral imagery and raw, possibly low quality, GPS/INS trajectory. We demonstrate that our approach allows for the automatic calibration of airborne systems with hyperspectral cameras, outperforms other state-of-the-art automatic rectification methods and reaches an accuracy on par with manual calibration methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

In this paper, it is demonstrated that major and minor variations due to changes in focal length and camera pose, respectively, can be identified with a recently proposed calibration method. It is readily observable from the experimental results that the former variations have different trends (directions) of principal point deviation for different types of camera, possibly due to different internal lens configurations, while the latter have very similar trends in the deviation which is most likely due to direction of gravity. Finally, to confirm the validity of such unprecedented findings, 3D to 2D reprojection errors are compared for different methods of camera calibration.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 figures | None |

Fusing this multi-view data is crucial for tasks like behavioral analysis, although it traditionally requires camera calibration, a process that is often complex. Moreover, previous studies have overlooked the challenges posed by self-occlusion under multiple views and the continuity of human body shape estimation. In this study, we introduce a method to reconstruct the 3D human body from multiple uncalibrated camera views. Initially, we utilize a pre-trained human body encoder to process each camera view individually, enabling the reconstruction of human body models and parameters for each view along with predicted camera positions. Rather than merely averaging the models across views, we develop a neural network trained to assign weights to individual views for all human body joints, based on the estimated distribution of joint distances from each camera. Additionally, we focus on the mesh surface of the human body for dynamic fusion, allowing for the seamless integration of facial expressions and body shape into a unified human body model. Our method has shown excellent performance in reconstructing the human body on two public datasets, advancing beyond previous work from the SMPL model to the SMPL-X model. This extension incorporates more complex hand poses and facial expressions, enhancing the detail and accuracy of the reconstructions. Crucially, it supports the flexible ad-hoc deployment of any number of cameras, offering significant potential for various applications.

We present a SynthCal generated calibration dataset with four common patterns, two camera types, and two environments with varying view, distortion, lighting, and noise levels for both monocular and multi-camera systems. The dataset evaluates both single and multi-view calibration algorithms by measuring re-projection and root-mean-square errors for identical patterns and camera settings. Additionally, we analyze the significance of different patterns using different calibration configurations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SynthCal in evaluating various calibration algorithms and patterns.</p></details> | ICPR 2024 | None |

We investigate a novel multi-camera multi-target association algorithm based on dense pixel correspondence estimation with a Transformer-based architecture and underlying detection-based masking. After the algorithm generates a set of corresponding keypoints and their respective confidence levels between every pair of detections in the camera views are computed, an affinity matrix is determined containing the probabilities of matches between each pair. Finally, the Hungarian algorithm is applied to generate an optimal assignment matrix with all the predicted associations between the camera views. Our method is evaluated on the WILDTRACK Seven-Camera HD Dataset, a high-resolution dataset containing footage of walking pedestrians as well as precise annotations and camera calibrations. Our results conclude that the algorithm performs exceptionally well associating pedestrians on camera pairs that are positioned close to each other and observe the scene from similar perspectives. On camera pairs with orientations that are drastically different in distance or angle, there is still significant room for improvement.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures | None |

A common approach to address this is to define a new trajectory for each possible grasp explicitly, but this is highly inefficient. Instead, we propose a method to adapt such trajectories directly while only requiring a period of self-supervised data collection, during which a camera observes the robot's end-effector moving with the object rigidly grasped. Importantly, our method requires no prior knowledge of the grasped object (such as a 3D CAD model), it can work with RGB images, depth images, or both, and it requires no camera calibration. Through a series of real-world experiments involving 1360 evaluations, we find that self-supervised RGB data consistently outperforms alternatives that rely on depth images including several state-of-the-art pose estimation methods. Compared to the best-performing baseline, our method results in an average of 28.5% higher success rate when adapting manipulation trajectories to novel grasps on several everyday tasks.

Despite this progress, current state-of-the-art methods struggle to reconstruct high frequency detail, due to factors such as a low-frequency bias of radiance fields and inaccurate camera calibration. One approach to mitigate this issue is to enhance images post-rendering. 2D enhancers can be pre-trained to recover some detail but are agnostic to scene geometry and do not easily generalize to new distributions of image degradation. Conversely, existing 3D enhancers are able to transfer detail from nearby training images in a generalizable manner, but suffer from inaccurate camera calibration and can propagate errors from the geometry into rendered images. We propose a neural rendering enhancer, RoGUENeRF, which exploits the best of both paradigms. Our method is pre-trained to learn a general enhancer while also leveraging information from nearby training images via robust 3D alignment and geometry-aware fusion. Our approach restores high-frequency textures while maintaining geometric consistency and is also robust to inaccurate camera calibration. We show that RoGUENeRF substantially enhances the rendering quality of a wide range of neural rendering baselines, e.g. improving the PSNR of MipNeRF360 by 0.63dB and Nerfacto by 1.34dB on the real world 360v2 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Single-image camera calibration with model-free distortion correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01263v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera calibration is a process of paramount importance in computer vision applications that require accurate quantitative measurements. The popular method developed by Zhang relies on the use of a large number of images of a planar grid of fiducial points captured in multiple poses. Although flexible and easy to implement, Zhang's method has some limitations. The simultaneous optimization of the entire parameter set, including the coefficients of a predefined distortion model, may result in poor distortion correction at the image boundaries or in miscalculation of the intrinsic parameters, even with a reasonably small reprojection error. Indeed, applications involving image stitching (e.g. multi-camera systems) require accurate mapping of distortion up to the outermost regions of the image. Moreover, intrinsic parameters affect the accuracy of camera pose estimation, which is fundamental for applications such as vision servoing in robot navigation and automated assembly. This paper proposes a method for estimating the complete set of calibration parameters from a single image of a planar speckle pattern covering the entire sensor. The correspondence between image points and physical points on the calibration target is obtained using Digital Image Correlation. The effective focal length and the extrinsic parameters are calculated separately after a prior evaluation of the principal point. At the end of the procedure, a dense and uniform model-free distortion map is obtained over the entire image. Synthetic data with different noise levels were used to test the feasibility of the proposed method and to compare its metrological performance with Zhang's method. Real-world tests demonstrate the potential of the developed method to reveal aspects of the image formation that are hidden by averaging over multiple images.</p></details> | Accepted manuscript | None |
| **[Multi-View People Detection in Large Scenes via Supervised View-Wise Contribution Weighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19943v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning-based multi-view people detection (MVD) methods have shown promising results on existing datasets. However, current methods are mainly trained and evaluated on small, single scenes with a limited number of multi-view frames and fixed camera views. As a result, these methods may not be practical for detecting people in larger, more complex scenes with severe occlusions and camera calibration errors. This paper focuses on improving multi-view people detection by developing a supervised view-wise contribution weighting approach that better fuses multi-camera information under large scenes. Besides, a large synthetic dataset is adopted to enhance the model's generalization ability and enable more practical evaluation and comparison. The model's performance on new testing scenes is further improved with a simple domain adaptation technique. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving promising cross-scene multi-view people detection performance.

| **[A Calibration Tool for Refractive Underwater Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18018v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many underwater robotic applications relying on vision sensors require proper camera calibration, i.e. knowing the incoming light ray for each pixel in the image. While for the ideal pinhole camera model all viewing rays intersect in a single 3D point, underwater cameras suffer from - possibly multiple - refractions of light rays at the interfaces of water, glass and air. These changes of direction depend on the position and orientation of the camera inside the water-proof housing, as well as on the shape and properties of the optical window, the port, itself. In recent years explicit models for underwater vision behind common ports such as flat or dome port have been proposed, but the underwater community is still lacking a calibration tool which can determine port parameters through refractive calibration. With this work we provide the first open source implementation of an underwater refractive camera calibration toolbox. It allows end-to-end calibration of underwater vision systems, including camera, stereo and housing calibration for systems with dome or flat ports. The implementation is verified using rendered datasets and real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, the paper is submitted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> | None |

Despite considerable advancements, existing methods often hinge on specific assumptions and struggle to generalize across varied real-world scenarios, and the performance is limited by insufficient training data. Recently, diffusion models trained on expansive datasets have been confirmed to maintain the capability to generate diverse, high-quality images. This success suggests a strong potential of the models to effectively understand varied visual information. In this work, we leverage the comprehensive visual knowledge embedded in pre-trained diffusion models to enable more robust and accurate monocular camera intrinsic estimation. Specifically, we reformulate the problem of estimating the four degrees of freedom (4-DoF) of camera intrinsic parameters as a dense incident map generation task. The map details the angle of incidence for each pixel in the RGB image, and its format aligns well with the paradigm of diffusion models. The camera intrinsic then can be derived from the incident map with a simple non-learning RANSAC algorithm during inference. Moreover, to further enhance the performance, we jointly estimate a depth map to provide extra geometric information for the incident map estimation. Extensive experiments on multiple testing datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, gaining up to a 40% reduction in prediction errors. Besides, the experiments also show that the precise camera intrinsic and depth maps estimated by our pipeline can greatly benefit practical applications such as 3D reconstruction from a single in-the-wild image.</p></details> |  | None |

This task poses a significant challenge in scenarios where the views from the real and mirrored cameras have no overlap or share salient features. To address this issue, prior knowledge of a human body and 2D joint locations are utilized to estimate the camera extrinsic parameters when a person is in front of a mirror. We devise a modified eight-point algorithm to obtain an initial estimation from 2D joint locations. The 2D joint locations are then refined subject to human body constraints. Finally, a RANSAC algorithm is employed to remove outliers by comparing their epipolar distances to a predetermined threshold. MirrorCalib achieves a rotation error of 1.82{\deg} and a translation error of 69.51 mm on a collected real-world dataset, which outperforms the state-of-art method.</p></details> | Accepted by AVSS2024 | None |
| **[Towards Unstructured Unlabeled Optical Mocap: A Video Helps!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06114v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical motion capture (mocap) requires accurately reconstructing the human body from retroreflective markers, including pose and shape. In a typical mocap setting, marker labeling is an important but tedious and error-prone step. Previous work has shown that marker labeling can be automated by using a structured template defining specific marker placements, but this places additional recording constraints. We propose to relax these constraints and solve for Unstructured Unlabeled Optical (UUO) mocap. Compared to the typical mocap setting that either labels markers or places them w.r.t a structured layout, markers in UUO mocap can be placed anywhere on the body and even on one specific limb (e.g., right leg for biomechanics research), hence it is of more practical significance. It is also more challenging. To solve UUO mocap, we exploit a monocular video captured by a single RGB camera, which does not require camera calibration. On this video, we run an off-the-shelf method to reconstruct and track a human individual, giving strong visual priors of human body pose and shape. With both the video and UUO markers, we propose an optimization pipeline towards marker identification, marker labeling, human pose estimation, and human body reconstruction. Our technical novelties include multiple hypothesis testing to optimize global orientation, and marker localization and marker-part matching to better optimize for body surface. We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively compare our method against state-of-the-art approaches, including marker-only mocap and video-only human body/shape reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our method resoundingly outperforms existing methods on three established benchmark datasets for both full-body and partial-body reconstruction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CasCalib: Cascaded Calibration for Motion Capture from Sparse Unsynchronized Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06845v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is now possible to estimate 3D human pose from monocular images with off-the-shelf 3D pose estimators. However, many practical applications require fine-grained absolute pose information for which multi-view cues and camera calibration are necessary. Such multi-view recordings are laborious because they require manual calibration, and are expensive when using dedicated hardware. Our goal is full automation, which includes temporal synchronization, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration. This is done by using persons in the scene as the calibration objects. Existing methods either address only synchronization or calibration, assume one of the former as input, or have significant limitations. A common limitation is that they only consider single persons, which eases correspondence finding. We attain this generality by partitioning the high-dimensional time and calibration space into a cascade of subspaces and introduce tailored algorithms to optimize each efficiently and robustly. The outcome is an easy-to-use, flexible, and robust motion capture toolbox that we release to enable scientific applications, which we demonstrate on diverse multi-view benchmarks.

This is a very challenging problem since its only input is several RGB images from different first-person views (FPVs) for a multi-person scene, without the BEV image and the calibration of the FPVs, while the output is a unified plane with the localization and orientation of both the subjects and cameras in a BEV. We propose an end-to-end framework solving this problem, whose main idea can be divided into following parts: i) creating a view-transform subject detection module to transform the FPV to a virtual BEV including localization and orientation of each pedestrian, ii) deriving a geometric transformation based method to estimate camera localization and view direction, i.e., the camera registration in a unified BEV, iii) making use of spatial and appearance information to aggregate the subjects into the unified BEV. We collect a new large-scale synthetic dataset with rich annotations for evaluation. The experimental results show the remarkable effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose the Evolutionary Stitched Camera calibration (ESC) algorithm to bridge this gap. It consists of image segmentation followed by evolutionary optimization of a novel loss function, providing a unified and accurate multi-camera calibration solution with high visual fidelity. The outcome allows the creation of virtual stitched views from multiple video sources, being as important for practical applications as numerical accuracy.

This tracking and identification process is crucial for reconstructing the game state, defined by the athletes' positions and identities on a 2D top-view of the pitch, (i.e. a minimap). However, reconstructing the game state from videos captured by a single camera is challenging. It requires understanding the position of the athletes and the viewpoint of the camera to localize and identify players within the field. In this work, we formalize the task of Game State Reconstruction and introduce SoccerNet-GSR, a novel Game State Reconstruction dataset focusing on football videos. SoccerNet-GSR is composed of 200 video sequences of 30 seconds, annotated with 9.37 million line points for pitch localization and camera calibration, as well as over 2.36 million athlete positions on the pitch with their respective role, team, and jersey number. Furthermore, we introduce GS-HOTA, a novel metric to evaluate game state reconstruction methods. Finally, we propose and release an end-to-end baseline for game state reconstruction, bootstrapping the research on this task. Our experiments show that GSR is a challenging novel task, which opens the field for future research.

| **[A Universal Protocol to Benchmark Camera Calibration for Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09807v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera calibration is a crucial component in the realm of sports analytics, as it serves as the foundation to extract 3D information out of the broadcast images. Despite the significance of camera calibration research in sports analytics, progress is impeded by outdated benchmarking criteria. Indeed, the annotation data and evaluation metrics provided by most currently available benchmarks strongly favor and incite the development of sports field registration methods, i.e. methods estimating homographies that map the sports field plane to the image plane. However, such homography-based methods are doomed to overlook the broader capabilities of camera calibration in bridging the 3D world to the image. In particular, real-world non-planar sports field elements (such as goals, corner flags, baskets, ...) and image distortion caused by broadcast camera lenses are out of the scope of sports field registration methods. To overcome these limitations, we designed a new benchmarking protocol, named ProCC, based on two principles: (1) the protocol should be agnostic to the camera model chosen for a camera calibration method, and (2) the protocol should fairly evaluate camera calibration methods using the reprojection of arbitrary yet accurately known 3D objects. Indirectly, we also provide insights into the metric used in SoccerNet-calibration, which solely relies on image annotation data of viewed 3D objects as ground truth, thus implementing our protocol. With experiments on the World Cup 2014, CARWC, and SoccerNet datasets, we show that our benchmarking protocol provides fairer evaluations of camera calibration methods. By defining our requirements for proper benchmarking, we hope to pave the way for a new stage in camera calibration for sports applications with high accuracy standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

This is a challenging problem due to the dynamics of traffic environments with 3D scenes of unknown depths. This problem is further complicated by the volatile distance between the driver and the camera system. To tackle these challenges, we develop a novel convolutional network that simultaneously analyzes the image of the scene and the image of the driver's face. This network has a camera calibration module that can compute an embedding vector that represents the spatial configuration between the driver and the camera system. This calibration module improves the overall network's performance, which can be jointly trained end to end. We also address the lack of annotated data for training and evaluation by introducing a large-scale driving dataset with point-of-gaze annotations. This is an in situ dataset of real driving sessions in an urban city, containing synchronized images of the driving scene as well as the face and gaze of the driver. Experiments on this dataset show that the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods, having the mean prediction error of 29.69 pixels, which is relatively small compared to the $1280{\times}720$ resolution of the scene camera.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-camera calibration with pattern rigs, including for non-overlapping cameras: CALICO](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06811v3)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes CALICO, a method for multi-camera calibration suitable for challenging contexts: stationary and mobile multi-camera systems, cameras without overlapping fields of view, and non-synchronized cameras. Recent approaches are roughly divided into infrastructure- and pattern-based. Infrastructure-based approaches use the scene's features to calibrate, while pattern-based approaches use calibration patterns. Infrastructure-based approaches are not suitable for stationary camera systems, and pattern-based approaches may constrain camera placement because shared fields of view or extremely large patterns are required. CALICO is a pattern-based approach, where the multi-calibration problem is formulated using rigidity constraints between patterns and cameras. We use a {\it pattern rig}: several patterns rigidly attached to each other or some structure. We express the calibration problem as that of algebraic and reprojection error minimization problems. Simulated and real experiments demonstrate the method in a variety of settings. CALICO compared favorably to Kalibr. Mean reconstruction accuracy error was $\le 0.71$ mm for real camera rigs, and $\le 1.11$ for simulated camera rigs.

The performance of such fusion-based algorithms largely depends on the accuracy of sensor calibration, which is challenging due to the difficulty of identifying common features across different data modalities. Previously, many calibration methods involved specific targets and/or manual intervention, which has proven to be cumbersome and costly. Learning-based online calibration methods have been proposed, but their performance is barely satisfactory in most cases. These methods usually suffer from issues such as sparse feature maps, unreliable cross-modality association, inaccurate calibration parameter regression, etc. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose CalibFormer, an end-to-end network for automatic LiDAR-camera calibration. We aggregate multiple layers of camera and LiDAR image features to achieve high-resolution representations. A multi-head correlation module is utilized to identify correlations between features more accurately. Lastly, we employ transformer architectures to estimate accurate calibration parameters from the correlation information. Our method achieved a mean translation error of $0.8751 \mathrm{cm}$ and a mean rotation error of $0.0562 ^{\circ}$ on the KITTI dataset, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating strong robustness, accuracy, and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Unbiased Estimator for Distorted Conics in Camera Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04583v2)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the literature, points and conics have been major features for camera geometric calibration. Although conics are more informative features than points, the loss of the conic property under distortion has critically limited the utility of conic features in camera calibration. Many existing approaches addressed conic-based calibration by ignoring distortion or introducing 3D spherical targets to circumvent this limitation. In this paper, we present a novel formulation for conic-based calibration using moments. Our derivation is based on the mathematical finding that the first moment can be estimated without bias even under distortion. This allows us to track moment changes during projection and distortion, ensuring the preservation of the first moment of the distorted conic. With an unbiased estimator, the circular patterns can be accurately detected at the sub-pixel level and can now be fully exploited for an entire calibration pipeline, resulting in significantly improved calibration.

In this work, we propose a novel constraints-based loss for measuring the intrinsic (focal length: $(f_x, f_y)$ and principal point: $(p_x, p_y)$) and extrinsic (baseline: ($b$), disparity: ($d$), translation: $(t_x, t_y, t_z)$, and rotation specifically pitch: $(\theta_p)$) camera parameters. Our novel constraints are based on geometric properties inherent in the camera model, including the anatomy of the projection matrix (vanishing points, image of world origin, axis planes) and the orthonormality of the rotation matrix. Thus we proposed a novel Unsupervised Geometric Constraint Loss (UGCL) via a multitask learning framework. Our methodology is a hybrid approach that employs the learning power of a neural network to estimate the desired parameters along with the underlying mathematical properties inherent in the camera projection matrix. This distinctive approach not only enhances the interpretability of the model but also facilitates a more informed learning process. Additionally, we introduce a new CVGL Camera Calibration dataset, featuring over 900 configurations of camera parameters, incorporating 63,600 image pairs that closely mirror real-world conditions. By training and testing on both synthetic and real-world datasets, our proposed approach demonstrates improvements across all parameters when compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks.

While binarization from intensity images is crucial for extracting the embedded information in the bimodal objects, few previous works consider the task of binarization of blurry images due to the relative motion between the vision sensor and the environment. The blurry images can result in a loss in the binarization quality and thus degrade the downstream applications where the vision system is in motion. Recently, neuromorphic cameras offer new capabilities for alleviating motion blur, but it is non-trivial to first deblur and then binarize the images in a real-time manner. In this work, we propose an event-based binary reconstruction method that leverages the prior knowledge of the bimodal target's properties to perform inference independently in both event space and image space and merge the results from both domains to generate a sharp binary image. We also develop an efficient integration method to propagate this binary image to high frame rate binary video. Finally, we develop a novel method to naturally fuse events and images for unsupervised threshold identification. The proposed method is evaluated in publicly available and our collected data sequence, and shows the proposed method can outperform the SOTA methods to generate high frame rate binary video in real-time on CPU-only devices.</p></details> | NA | None |

We learn a generative model for 3D animatable photo-realistic head avatar from a multi-view dataset of expressions from 2407 subjects, and leverage it as a prior for creating personalized avatar from few-shot images. Different from previous 3D-aware face generative models, our prior is built with a 3DMM-anchored neural radiance field backbone, which we show to be more effective for avatar creation through auto-decoding based on few-shot inputs. We also handle unstable 3DMM fitting by jointly optimizing the 3DMM fitting and camera calibration that leads to better few-shot adaptation. Our method demonstrates compelling results and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for few-shot avatar adaptation, paving the way for more efficient and personalized avatar creation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The Influence of Autofocus Lenses in the Camera Calibration Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04686v1)** | 2024-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera calibration is a crucial step in robotics and computer vision. Accurate camera parameters are necessary to achieve robust applications. Nowadays, camera calibration process consists of adjusting a set of data to a pin-hole model, assuming that with a reprojection error close to cero, camera parameters are correct. Since all camera parameters are unknown, computed results are considered true. However, the pin-hole model does not represent the camera behavior accurately if the focus is considered. Real cameras change the focal length slightly to obtain sharp objects in the image and this feature skews the calibration result if a unique pin-hole model is computed with a constant focal length. In this paper, a deep analysis of the camera calibration process is done to detect and strengthen its weaknesses. The camera is mounted in a robot arm to known extrinsic camera parameters with accuracy and to be able to compare computed results with the true ones. Based on the bias that exist between computed results and the true ones, a modification of the widely accepted camera calibration method using images of a planar template is presented. A pin-hole model with distance dependent focal length is proposed to improve the calibration process substantially</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Application of 2D Homography for High Resolution Traffic Data Collection using CCTV Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07220v1)** | 2024-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic cameras remain the primary source data for surveillance activities such as congestion and incident monitoring. To date, State agencies continue to rely on manual effort to extract data from networked cameras due to limitations of the current automatic vision systems including requirements for complex camera calibration and inability to generate high resolution data. This study implements a three-stage video analytics framework for extracting high-resolution traffic data such vehicle counts, speed, and acceleration from infrastructure-mounted CCTV cameras. The key components of the framework include object recognition, perspective transformation, and vehicle trajectory reconstruction for traffic data collection. First, a state-of-the-art vehicle recognition model is implemented to detect and classify vehicles. Next, to correct for camera distortion and reduce partial occlusion, an algorithm inspired by two-point linear perspective is utilized to extracts the region of interest (ROI) automatically, while a 2D homography technique transforms the CCTV view to bird's-eye view (BEV). Cameras are calibrated with a two-layer matrix system to enable the extraction of speed and acceleration by converting image coordinates to real-world measurements. Individual vehicle trajectories are constructed and compared in BEV using two time-space-feature-based object trackers, namely Motpy and BYTETrack. The results of the current study showed about +/- 4.5% error rate for directional traffic counts, less than 10% MSE for speed bias between camera estimates in comparison to estimates from probe data sources. Extracting high-resolution data from traffic cameras has several implications, ranging from improvements in traffic management and identify dangerous driving behavior, high-risk areas for accidents, and other safety concerns, enabling proactive measures to reduce accidents and fatalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, this paper was submitted for consideration for presentation at the 102nd Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board, January 2023</p></details> | None |

As the most significant feature of the IRAv4, a task-specific connected dominating set is extracted to serve as a more reliable and accurate reference for rotation global alignment. In addition, to further address the limitations of the existing rotation averaging benchmark of relying on the slightly outdated Bundler camera calibration results as ground truths and focusing solely on rotation estimation accuracy, this paper presents a new COLMAP-based rotation averaging benchmark that incorporates a cross check between COLMAP and Bundler, and employ the accuracy of both rotation and downstream location estimation as evaluation metrics, which is desired to provide a more reliable and comprehensive evaluation tool for the rotation averaging research. Comprehensive comparisons between the proposed IRAv4 and other mainstream rotation averaging methods on this new benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions</p></details> | None |
| **[Camera calibration for the surround-view system: a benchmark and dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16499v1)** | 2023-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surround-view system (SVS) is widely used in the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). SVS uses four fisheye lenses to monitor real-time scenes around the vehicle. However, accurate intrinsic and extrinsic parameter estimation is required for the proper functioning of the system. At present, the intrinsic calibration can be pipeline by utilizing checkerboard algorithm, while extrinsic calibration is still immature. Therefore, we proposed a specific calibration pipeline to estimate extrinsic parameters robustly. This scheme takes a driving sequence of four cameras as input. It firstly utilizes lane line to roughly estimate each camera pose. Considering the environmental condition differences in each camera, we separately select strategies from two methods to accurately estimate the extrinsic parameters. To achieve accurate estimates for both front and rear camera, we proposed a method that mutually iterating line detection and pose estimation. As for bilateral camera, we iteratively adjust the camera pose and position by minimizing texture and edge error between ground projections of adjacent cameras. After estimating the extrinsic parameters, the surround-view image can be synthesized by homography-based transformation. The proposed pipeline can robustly estimate the four SVS camera extrinsic parameters in real driving environments. In addition, to evaluate the proposed scheme, we build a surround-view fisheye dataset, which contains 40 videos with 32,000 frames, acquired from different real traffic scenarios. All the frames in each video are manually labeled with lane annotation, with its GT extrinsic parameters. Moreover, this surround-view dataset could be used by other researchers to evaluate their performance. The dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Trajectory Approximation of Video Based on Phase Correlation for Forward Facing Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12680v1)** | 2023-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach for extracting trajectories from a camera sensor in GPS-denied environments, leveraging visual odometry. The system takes video footage captured by a forward-facing camera mounted on a vehicle as input, with the output being a chain code representing the camera's trajectory. The proposed methodology involves several key steps. Firstly, we employ phase correlation between consecutive frames of the video to extract essential information. Subsequently, we introduce a novel chain code method termed "dynamic chain code," which is based on the x-shift values derived from the phase correlation. The third step involves determining directional changes (forward, left, right) by establishing thresholds and extracting the corresponding chain code. This extracted code is then stored in a buffer for further processing. Notably, our system outperforms traditional methods reliant on spatial features, exhibiting greater speed and robustness in noisy environments. Importantly, our approach operates without external camera calibration information. Moreover, by incorporating visual odometry, our system enhances its accuracy in estimating camera motion, providing a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory dynamics. Finally, the system culminates in the visualization of the normalized camera motion trajectory.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Simultaneous Color Computer Generated Holography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11287v2)** | 2023-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer generated holography has long been touted as the future of augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) displays, but has yet to be realized in practice. Previous high-quality, color holographic displays have made either a 3$\times$ sacrifice on frame rate by using a sequential color illumination scheme or used more than one spatial light modulator (SLM) and/or bulky, complex optical setups. The reduced frame rate of sequential color introduces distracting judder and color fringing in the presence of head motion while the form factor of current simultaneous color systems is incompatible with a head-mounted display. In this work, we propose a framework for simultaneous color holography that allows the use of the full SLM frame rate while maintaining a compact and simple optical setup. Simultaneous color holograms are optimized through the use of a perceptual loss function, a physics-based neural network wavefront propagator, and a camera-calibrated forward model. We measurably improve hologram quality compared to other simultaneous color methods and move one step closer to the realization of color holographic displays for AR/VR.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tame a Wild Camera: In-the-Wild Monocular Camera Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10988v2)** | 2023-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D sensing for monocular in-the-wild images, e.g., depth estimation and 3D object detection, has become increasingly important. However, the unknown intrinsic parameter hinders their development and deployment. Previous methods for the monocular camera calibration rely on specific 3D objects or strong geometry prior, such as using a checkerboard or imposing a Manhattan World assumption. This work solves the problem from the other perspective by exploiting the monocular 3D prior. Our method is assumption-free and calibrates the complete $4$ Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) intrinsic parameters. First, we demonstrate intrinsic is solved from two well-studied monocular priors, i.e., monocular depthmap, and surface normal map. However, this solution imposes a low-bias and low-variance requirement for depth estimation. Alternatively, we introduce a novel monocular 3D prior, the incidence field, defined as the incidence rays between points in 3D space and pixels in the 2D imaging plane. The incidence field is a pixel-wise parametrization of the intrinsic invariant to image cropping and resizing. With the estimated incidence field, a robust RANSAC algorithm recovers intrinsic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing superior performance on synthetic and zero-shot testing datasets. Beyond calibration, we demonstrate downstream applications in image manipulation detection & restoration, uncalibrated two-view pose estimation, and 3D sensing.

| **[Unsupervised Multi-view Pedestrian Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12457v2)** | 2023-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prosperity of the video surveillance, multiple cameras have been applied to accurately locate pedestrians in a specific area. However, previous methods rely on the human-labeled annotations in every video frame and camera view, leading to heavier burden than necessary camera calibration and synchronization. Therefore, we propose in this paper an Unsupervised Multi-view Pedestrian Detection approach (UMPD) to eliminate the need of annotations to learn a multi-view pedestrian detector via 2D-3D mapping. 1) Firstly, Semantic-aware Iterative Segmentation (SIS) is proposed to extract unsupervised representations of multi-view images, which are converted into 2D pedestrian masks as pseudo labels, via our proposed iterative PCA and zero-shot semantic classes from vision-language models. 2) Secondly, we propose Geometry-aware Volume-based Detector (GVD) to end-to-end encode multi-view 2D images into a 3D volume to predict voxel-wise density and color via 2D-to-3D geometric projection, trained by 3D-to-2D rendering losses with SIS pseudo labels. 3) Thirdly, for better detection results, i.e., the 3D density projected on Birds-Eye-View from GVD, we propose Vertical-aware BEV Regularization (VBR) to constraint them to be vertical like the natural pedestrian poses. Extensive experiments on popular multi-view pedestrian detection benchmarks Wildtrack, Terrace, and MultiviewX, show that our proposed UMPD approach, as the first fully-unsupervised method to our best knowledge, performs competitively to the previous state-of-the-art supervised techniques.

The absence of precise camera calibration data, including intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, hinders accurate real-world distance measurements from captured videos. To address this, we present a scalable framework that utilizes street-level imagery to reconstruct a metric 3D model, facilitating precise calibration of in-the-wild traffic cameras. Notably, our framework achieves 3D scene reconstruction and accurate localization of over 100 global traffic cameras and is scalable to any camera with sufficient street-level imagery. For evaluation, we introduce a dataset of 20 fully calibrated traffic cameras, demonstrating our method's significant enhancements over existing automatic calibration techniques. Furthermore, we highlight our approach's utility in traffic analysis by extracting insights via 3D vehicle reconstruction and speed measurement, thereby opening up the potential of using outdoor cameras for automated analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in WACV 2024.

Uniquely, we cast the 360-degree dynamic object reconstruction as a 4D generation problem, eliminating the need for tedious multi-view data collection and camera calibration. This is achieved by leveraging the object-level 3D-aware image diffusion model as the primary supervision signal for training Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (DyNeRF). Specifically, we propose a Cascade DyNeRF to facilitate stable convergence and temporal continuity under the supervision signal which is discrete along the time axis. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, we further introduce an Interpolation-driven Consistency Loss. It is optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between rendered frames from DyNeRF and interpolated frames from a pre-trained video interpolation model. Extensive experiments show that our Consistent4D can perform competitively to prior art alternatives, opening up new possibilities for 4D dynamic object generation from monocular videos, whilst also demonstrating advantage for conventional text-to-3D generation tasks.

| **[Automated Camera Calibration via Homography Estimation with GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02598v1)** | 2023-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few decades, a significant rise of camera-based applications for traffic monitoring has occurred. Governments and local administrations are increasingly relying on the data collected from these cameras to enhance road safety and optimize traffic conditions. However, for effective data utilization, it is imperative to ensure accurate and automated calibration of the involved cameras. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by leveraging the topological structure of intersections. We propose a framework involving the generation of a set of synthetic intersection viewpoint images from a bird's-eye-view image, framed as a graph of virtual cameras to model these images. Using the capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, we effectively learn the relationships within this graph, thereby facilitating the estimation of a homography matrix. This estimation leverages the neighbourhood representation for any real-world camera and is enhanced by exploiting multiple images instead of a single match. In turn, the homography matrix allows the retrieval of extrinsic calibration parameters. As a result, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance on both synthetic datasets and real-world cameras, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods using cascading spatial transformation (CST) often lead to cumulative errors in large-scale deployments. Manual camera calibration is insufficient and requires extensive manual work, and existing methods are limited to controlled or single-view scenarios. To address these challenges, our research introduces a parallel spatial transformation (PST)-based framework for large-scale, multi-view, multi-sensor scenarios. PST parallelizes sensor coordinate system transformation, reducing cumulative errors. We incorporate deep learning for precise roadside monocular global localization, reducing manual work. Additionally, we use geolocation cues and an optimization algorithm for improved synchronization accuracy. Our framework has been tested in real-world scenarios, outperforming CST-based methods. It significantly enhances large-scale roadside multi-perspective, multi-sensor spatial synchronization, reducing deployment costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Previous calibration methods often required specific targets or manual adjustments, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Online calibration methods based on features have been proposed, but these methods encounter challenges such as imprecise feature extraction, unreliable cross-modality associations, and high scene-specific requirements. To address this, we introduce an edge-based approach for automatic online calibration of LiDAR and cameras in real-world scenarios. The edge features, which are prevalent in various environments, are aligned in both images and point clouds to determine the extrinsic parameters. Specifically, stable and robust image edge features are extracted using a SAM-based method and the edge features extracted from the point cloud are weighted through a multi-frame weighting strategy for feature filtering. Finally, accurate extrinsic parameters are optimized based on edge correspondence constraints. We conducted evaluations on both the KITTI dataset and our dataset. The results show a state-of-the-art rotation accuracy of 0.086{\deg} and a translation accuracy of 0.977 cm, outperforming existing edge-based calibration methods in both precision and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Holistic Parking Slot Detection with Polygon-Shaped Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11629v1)** | 2023-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current parking slot detection in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) primarily relies on ultrasonic sensors. This method has several limitations such as the need to scan the entire parking slot before detecting it, the incapacity of detecting multiple slots in a row, and the difficulty of classifying them. Due to the complex visual environment, vehicles are equipped with surround view camera systems to detect vacant parking slots. Previous research works in this field mostly use image-domain models to solve the problem. These two-stage approaches separate the 2D detection and 3D pose estimation steps using camera calibration. In this paper, we propose one-step Holistic Parking Slot Network (HPS-Net), a tailor-made adaptation of the You Only Look Once (YOLO)v4 algorithm. This camera-based approach directly outputs the four vertex coordinates of the parking slot in topview domain, instead of a bounding box in raw camera images. Several visible points and shapes can be proposed from different angles. A novel regression loss function named polygon-corner Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) for polygon vertex position optimization is also proposed to manage the slot orientation and to distinguish the entrance line. Experiments show that HPS-Net can detect various vacant parking slots with a F1-score of 0.92 on our internal Valeo Parking Slots Dataset (VPSD) and 0.99 on the public dataset PS2.0. It provides a satisfying generalization and robustness in various parking scenarios, such as indoor (F1: 0.86) or paved ground (F1: 0.91). Moreover, it achieves a real-time detection speed of 17 FPS on Nvidia Drive AGX Xavier. A demo video can be found at https://streamable.com/75j7sj.</p></details> |  | None |

Rapid progress has been made in the algorithm aspect over the years, yet existing human-centric rendering datasets and benchmarks are rather impoverished in terms of diversity, which are crucial for rendering effect. Researchers are usually constrained to explore and evaluate a small set of rendering problems on current datasets, while real-world applications require methods to be robust across different scenarios. In this work, we present DNA-Rendering, a large-scale, high-fidelity repository of human performance data for neural actor rendering. DNA-Rendering presents several alluring attributes. First, our dataset contains over 1500 human subjects, 5000 motion sequences, and 67.5M frames' data volume. Second, we provide rich assets for each subject -- 2D/3D human body keypoints, foreground masks, SMPLX models, cloth/accessory materials, multi-view images, and videos. These assets boost the current method's accuracy on downstream rendering tasks. Third, we construct a professional multi-view system to capture data, which contains 60 synchronous cameras with max 4096 x 3000 resolution, 15 fps speed, and stern camera calibration steps, ensuring high-quality resources for task training and evaluation. Along with the dataset, we provide a large-scale and quantitative benchmark in full-scale, with multiple tasks to evaluate the existing progress of novel view synthesis, novel pose animation synthesis, and novel identity rendering methods. In this manuscript, we describe our DNA-Rendering effort as a revealing of new observations, challenges, and future directions to human-centric rendering.

These methods typically require a large number of multi-view input images, making the process hardware intensive and cumbersome, limiting applicability to unconstrained settings. We propose a novel volumetric human face prior that enables the synthesis of ultra high-resolution novel views of subjects that are not part of the prior's training distribution. This prior model consists of an identity-conditioned NeRF, trained on a dataset of low-resolution multi-view images of diverse humans with known camera calibration. A simple sparse landmark-based 3D alignment of the training dataset allows our model to learn a smooth latent space of geometry and appearance despite a limited number of training identities. A high-quality volumetric representation of a novel subject can be obtained by model fitting to 2 or 3 camera views of arbitrary resolution. Importantly, our method requires as few as two views of casually captured images as input at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[How to turn your camera into a perfect pinhole model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11326v1)** | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera calibration is a first and fundamental step in various computer vision applications. Despite being an active field of research, Zhang's method remains widely used for camera calibration due to its implementation in popular toolboxes. However, this method initially assumes a pinhole model with oversimplified distortion models. In this work, we propose a novel approach that involves a pre-processing step to remove distortions from images by means of Gaussian processes. Our method does not need to assume any distortion model and can be applied to severely warped images, even in the case of multiple distortion sources, e.g., a fisheye image of a curved mirror reflection. The Gaussian processes capture all distortions and camera imperfections, resulting in virtual images as though taken by an ideal pinhole camera with square pixels. Furthermore, this ideal GP-camera only needs one image of a square grid calibration pattern. This model allows for a serious upgrade of many algorithms and applications that are designed in a pure projective geometry setting but with a performance that is very sensitive to nonlinear lens distortions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by simplifying Zhang's calibration method, reducing the number of parameters and getting rid of the distortion parameters and iterative optimization. We validate by means of synthetic data and real world images. The contributions of this work include the construction of a virtual ideal pinhole camera using Gaussian processes, a simplified calibration method and lens distortion removal.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, conference CIARP</p></details> | None |

For this third edition, the challenges were composed of seven vision-based tasks split into three main themes. The first theme, broadcast video understanding, is composed of three high-level tasks related to describing events occurring in the video broadcasts: (1) action spotting, focusing on retrieving all timestamps related to global actions in soccer, (2) ball action spotting, focusing on retrieving all timestamps related to the soccer ball change of state, and (3) dense video captioning, focusing on describing the broadcast with natural language and anchored timestamps. The second theme, field understanding, relates to the single task of (4) camera calibration, focusing on retrieving the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from images. The third and last theme, player understanding, is composed of three low-level tasks related to extracting information about the players: (5) re-identification, focusing on retrieving the same players across multiple views, (6) multiple object tracking, focusing on tracking players and the ball through unedited video streams, and (7) jersey number recognition, focusing on recognizing the jersey number of players from tracklets. Compared to the previous editions of the SoccerNet challenges, tasks (2-3-7) are novel, including new annotations and data, task (4) was enhanced with more data and annotations, and task (6) now focuses on end-to-end approaches.

This task finds another important application in sports analytics and, in this work, we present a novel method for 3D basketball localization from a single calibrated image. Our approach predicts the object's height in pixels in image space by estimating its projection onto the ground plane within the image, leveraging the image itself and the object's location as inputs. The 3D coordinates of the ball are then reconstructed by exploiting the known projection matrix. Extensive experiments on the public DeepSport dataset, which provides ground truth annotations for 3D ball location alongside camera calibration information for each image, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, offering substantial accuracy improvements compared to recent work.

There were two purposes for the creation of this challenge: (1) the establishment of the first standardised benchmark for the research community to assess soft-tissue trackers; and (2) to encourage the development of unsupervised deep learning methods, given the lack of annotated data in surgery. A dataset of 157 stereo endoscopic videos from 20 clinical cases, along with stereo camera calibration parameters, have been provided. Participants were assigned the task of developing algorithms to track the movement of soft tissues, represented by bounding boxes, in stereo endoscopic videos. At the end of the challenge, the developed methods were assessed on a previously hidden test subset. This assessment uses benchmarking metrics that were purposely developed for this challenge, to verify the efficacy of unsupervised deep learning algorithms in tracking soft-tissue. The metric used for ranking the methods was the Expected Average Overlap (EAO) score, which measures the average overlap between a tracker's and the ground truth bounding boxes. Coming first in the challenge was the deep learning submission by ICVS-2Ai with a superior EAO score of 0.617. This method employs ARFlow to estimate unsupervised dense optical flow from cropped images, using photometric and regularization losses. Second, Jmees with an EAO of 0.583, uses deep learning for surgical tool segmentation on top of a non-deep learning baseline method: CSRT. CSRT by itself scores a similar EAO of 0.563.

| **[Joint Intrinsic and Extrinsic LiDAR-Camera Calibration in Targetless Environments Using Plane-Constrained Bundle Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12629v1)** | 2023-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel targetless method for joint intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of LiDAR-camera systems using plane-constrained bundle adjustment (BA). Our method leverages LiDAR point cloud measurements from planes in the scene, alongside visual points derived from those planes. The core novelty of our method lies in the integration of visual BA with the registration between visual points and LiDAR point cloud planes, which is formulated as a unified optimization problem. This formulation achieves concurrent intrinsic and extrinsic calibration, while also imparting depth constraints to the visual points to enhance the accuracy of intrinsic calibration. Experiments are conducted on both public data sequences and self-collected dataset. The results showcase that our approach not only surpasses other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also maintains remarkable calibration accuracy even within challenging environments. For the benefits of the robotics community, we have open sourced our codes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GPU Accelerated Color Correction and Frame Warping for Real-time Video Stitching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09209v1)** | 2023-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional image stitching focuses on a single panorama frame without considering the spatial-temporal consistency in videos. The straightforward image stitching approach will cause temporal flicking and color inconstancy when it is applied to the video stitching task. Besides, inaccurate camera parameters will cause artifacts in the image warping. In this paper, we propose a real-time system to stitch multiple video sequences into a panoramic video, which is based on GPU accelerated color correction and frame warping without accurate camera parameters. We extend the traditional 2D-Matrix (2D-M) color correction approach and a present spatio-temporal 3D-Matrix (3D-M) color correction method for the overlap local regions with online color balancing using a piecewise function on global frames. Furthermore, we use pairwise homography matrices given by coarse camera calibration for global warping followed by accurate local warping based on the optical flow. Experimental results show that our system can generate highquality panorama videos in real time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Online Camera Calibration for Automated Driving and Parking Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08495v1)** | 2023-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based perception systems play a central role in modern autonomous vehicles. These camera based perception algorithms require an accurate calibration to map the real world distances to image pixels. In practice, calibration is a laborious procedure requiring specialised data collection and careful tuning. This process must be repeated whenever the parameters of the camera change, which can be a frequent occurrence in autonomous vehicles. Hence there is a need to calibrate at regular intervals to ensure the camera is accurate. Proposed is a deep learning framework to learn intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of the camera in real time. The framework is self-supervised and doesn't require any labelling or supervision to learn the calibration parameters. The framework learns calibration without the need for any physical targets or to drive the car on special planar surfaces.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04079v1)** | 2023-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (>= 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/</p></details> | None |
| **[Homography Estimation in Complex Topological Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01086v1)** | 2023-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surveillance videos and images are used for a broad set of applications, ranging from traffic analysis to crime detection. Extrinsic camera calibration data is important for most analysis applications. However, security cameras are susceptible to environmental conditions and small camera movements, resulting in a need for an automated re-calibration method that can account for these varying conditions. In this paper, we present an automated camera-calibration process leveraging a dictionary-based approach that does not require prior knowledge on any camera settings. The method consists of a custom implementation of a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and a novel topological loss function. Experiments reveal that the proposed method improves the IoU metric by up to 12% w.r.t. a state-of-the-art model across five synthetic datasets and the World Cup 2014 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Will ...</summary><p>Will be published in Intelligent Vehicle Symposium 2023</p></details> | None |
