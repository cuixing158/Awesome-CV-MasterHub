| **[SARChat-Bench-2M: A Multi-Task Vision-Language Benchmark for SAR Image Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08168v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a powerful all-weather Earth observation tool, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing enables critical military reconnaissance, maritime surveillance, and infrastructure monitoring. Although Vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing and image understanding, their applications remain limited in professional domains due to insufficient domain expertise. This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompasses diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains. Through experiments on 16 mainstream VLMs, the effectiveness of the dataset has been fully verified. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/SARChat.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/JimmyMa99/SARChat) |
| **[GUI Agents with Foundation Models: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04890v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), have facilitated the development of intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks. By leveraging the ability of (M)LLMs to process and interpret Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), these agents can autonomously execute user instructions, simulating human-like interactions such as clicking and typing. This survey consolidates recent research on (M)LLM-based GUI agents, highlighting key innovations in data resources, frameworks, and applications. We begin by reviewing representative datasets and benchmarks, followed by an overview of a generalized, unified framework that encapsulates the essential components of prior studies, supported by a detailed taxonomy. Additionally, we explore relevant commercial applications. Drawing insights from existing work, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions. We hope this survey will inspire further advancements in the field of (M)LLM-based GUI agents.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Space-Aware Instruction Tuning: Dataset and Benchmark for Guide Dog Robots Assisting the Visually Impaired](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07183v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guide dog robots offer promising solutions to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals, addressing the limitations of traditional guide dogs, particularly in perceptual intelligence and communication. With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM</p></details> | ICRA 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM) |
| **[Safety at Scale: A Comprehensive Survey of Large Model Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05206v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 3 figures, 11 tables GitHub: https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety) |
| **[Towards Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection and Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07601v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study.

| **[Evaluation of Deep Audio Representations for Hearables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06664v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively steering hearable devices requires understanding the acoustic environment around the user. In the computational analysis of sound scenes, foundation models have emerged as the state of the art to produce high-performance, robust, multi-purpose audio representations. We introduce and release Deep Evaluation of Audio Representations (DEAR), the first dataset and benchmark to evaluate the efficacy of foundation models in capturing essential acoustic properties for hearables. The dataset includes 1,158 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long, created by spatially mixing proprietary monologues with commercial, high-quality recordings of everyday acoustic scenes. Our benchmark encompasses eight tasks that assess the general context, speech sources, and technical acoustic properties of the audio scenes. Through our evaluation of four general-purpose audio representation models, we demonstrate that the BEATs model significantly surpasses its counterparts. This superiority underscores the advantage of models trained on diverse audio collections, confirming their applicability to a wide array of auditory tasks, including encoding the environment properties necessary for hearable steering. The DEAR dataset and associated code are available at https://dear-dataset.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Optical Character Recognition in Dynamic Video Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06445v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an open-source benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks in dynamic video environments. We present a curated dataset containing 1,477 manually annotated frames spanning diverse domains, including code editors, news broadcasts, YouTube videos, and advertisements. Three state of the art VLMs - Claude-3, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o are benchmarked against traditional OCR systems such as EasyOCR and RapidOCR. Evaluation metrics include Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and Accuracy. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of VLMs in video-based OCR tasks, demonstrating their potential to outperform conventional OCR models in many scenarios. However, challenges such as hallucinations, content security policies, and sensitivity to occluded or stylized text remain. The dataset and benchmarking framework are publicly available to foster further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset: https://github.com/video-db/ocr-benchmark</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/video-db/ocr-benchmark) |
| **[Open Challenges in Time Series Anomaly Detection: An Industry Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05392v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in time-series anomaly detection is using definitions that miss critical aspects of how anomaly detection is commonly used in practice. We list several areas that are of practical relevance and that we believe are either under-investigated or missing entirely from the current discourse. Based on an investigation of systems deployed in a cloud environment, we motivate the areas of streaming algorithms, human-in-the-loop scenarios, point processes, conditional anomalies and populations analysis of time series. This paper serves as a motivation and call for action, including opportunities for theoretical and applied research, as well as for building new dataset and benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BOUQuET: dataset, Benchmark and Open initiative for Universal Quality Evaluation in Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04314v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents BOUQuET, a multicentric and multi-register/domain dataset and benchmark, and its broader collaborative extension initiative. This dataset is handcrafted in non-English languages first, each of these source languages being represented among the 23 languages commonly used by half of the world's population and therefore having the potential to serve as pivot languages that will enable more accurate translations. The dataset is specially designed to avoid contamination and be multicentric, so as to enforce representation of multilingual language features. In addition, the dataset goes beyond the sentence level, as it is organized in paragraphs of various lengths. Compared with related machine translation (MT) datasets, we show that BOUQuET has a broader representation of domains while simplifying the translation task for non-experts. Therefore, BOUQuET is specially suitable for the open initiative and call for translation participation that we are launching to extend it to a multi-way parallel corpus to any written language.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Synthetic Datasets for Machine Learning on Spatio-Temporal Graphs using PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04140v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many physical processes can be expressed through partial differential equations (PDEs). Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements. The source code for our methodology and the three created datasets can be found on https://github.com/github-usr-ano/Temporal_Graph_Data_PDEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/github-usr-ano/Temporal_Graph_Data_PDEs) |
| **[LMOD: A Large Multimodal Ophthalmology Dataset and Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01620v5)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of vision-threatening eye diseases is a significant global burden, with many cases remaining undiagnosed or diagnosed too late for effective treatment. Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have the potential to assist in understanding anatomical information, diagnosing eye diseases, and drafting interpretations and follow-up plans, thereby reducing the burden on clinicians and improving access to eye care. However, limited benchmarks are available to assess LVLMs' performance in ophthalmology-specific applications. In this study, we introduce LMOD, a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark consisting of 21,993 instances across (1) five ophthalmic imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography, color fundus photographs, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, lens photographs, and surgical scenes; (2) free-text, demographic, and disease biomarker information; and (3) primary ophthalmology-specific applications such as anatomical information understanding, disease diagnosis, and subgroup analysis. In addition, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art LVLM representatives from closed-source, open-source, and medical domains. The results demonstrate a significant performance drop for LVLMs in ophthalmology compared to other domains. Systematic error analysis further identified six major failure modes: misclassification, failure to abstain, inconsistent reasoning, hallucination, assertions without justification, and lack of domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, supervised neural networks specifically trained on these tasks as baselines demonstrated high accuracy. These findings underscore the pressing need for benchmarks in the development and validation of ophthalmology-specific LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 NAACL: Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics Project Page: https://kfzyqin.github.io/lmod/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kfzyqin.github.io/lmod) |
| **[TUMTraffic-VideoQA: A Benchmark for Unified Spatio-Temporal Video Understanding in Traffic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02449v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TUMTraffic-VideoQA, a novel dataset and benchmark designed for spatio-temporal video understanding in complex roadside traffic scenarios. The dataset comprises 1,000 videos, featuring 85,000 multiple-choice QA pairs, 2,300 object captioning, and 5,700 object grounding annotations, encompassing diverse real-world conditions such as adverse weather and traffic anomalies. By incorporating tuple-based spatio-temporal object expressions, TUMTraffic-VideoQA unifies three essential tasks-multiple-choice video question answering, referred object captioning, and spatio-temporal object grounding-within a cohesive evaluation framework. We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems. The dataset and benchmark are publicly available to facilitate further exploration.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02379v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches on popular benchmark datasets. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- the graph structure and the node features -- , we introduce RINGS, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., by quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing, from a distinct angle, the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for graph-learning dataset evaluation in an extensive set of experiments and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a first step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SEED4D: A Synthetic Ego--Exo Dynamic 4D Data Generator, Driving Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00730v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models for egocentric 3D and 4D reconstruction, including few-shot interpolation and extrapolation settings, can benefit from having images from exocentric viewpoints as supervision signals. No existing dataset provides the necessary mixture of complex, dynamic, and multi-view data. To facilitate the development of 3D and 4D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving context, we propose a Synthetic Ego--Exo Dynamic 4D (SEED4D) data generator and dataset. We present a customizable, easy-to-use data generator for spatio-temporal multi-view data creation. Our open-source data generator allows the creation of synthetic data for camera setups commonly used in the NuScenes, KITTI360, and Waymo datasets. Additionally, SEED4D encompasses two large-scale multi-view synthetic urban scene datasets. Our static (3D) dataset encompasses 212k inward- and outward-facing vehicle images from 2k scenes, while our dynamic (4D) dataset contains 16.8M images from 10k trajectories, each sampled at 100 points in time with egocentric images, exocentric images, and LiDAR data.

| **[LVLM-COUNT: Enhancing the Counting Ability of Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00686v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting is a fundamental operation for various visual tasks in real-life applications, requiring both object recognition and robust counting capabilities. Despite their advanced visual perception, large vision-language models (LVLMs) struggle with counting tasks, especially when the number of objects exceeds those commonly encountered during training. We enhance LVLMs' counting abilities using a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking counting problems into sub-counting tasks. Our method employs a mechanism that prevents bisecting and thus repetitive counting of objects, which occurs in a naive divide-and-conquer approach. Unlike prior methods, which do not generalize well to counting datasets they have not been trained on, our method performs well on new datasets without any additional training or fine-tuning. We demonstrate that our approach enhances the counting capability of LVLMs across various datasets and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 24 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> | None |

However, toxic feedback can discourage authors and hinder scientific progress. This work explores an important but underexplored area: detecting toxicity in peer reviews. We first define toxicity in peer reviews across four distinct categories and curate a dataset of peer reviews from the OpenReview platform, annotated by human experts according to these definitions. Leveraging this dataset, we benchmark a variety of models, including a dedicated toxicity detection model, a sentiment analysis model, several open-source large language models (LLMs), and two closed-source LLMs. Our experiments explore the impact of different prompt granularities, from coarse to fine-grained instructions, on model performance. Notably, state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 exhibit low alignment with human judgments under simple prompts but achieve improved alignment with detailed instructions. Moreover, the model's confidence score is a good indicator of better alignment with human judgments. For example, GPT-4 achieves a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.56 with human judgments, which increases to 0.63 when using only predictions with a confidence score higher than 95%. Overall, our dataset and benchmarks underscore the need for continued research to enhance toxicity detection capabilities of LLMs. By addressing this issue, our work aims to contribute to a healthy and responsible environment for constructive academic discourse and scientific collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WiML workshop @Neurips 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[TESTEVAL: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Test Case Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04531v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing plays a crucial role in the software development cycle, enabling the detection of bugs, vulnerabilities, and other undesirable behaviors. To perform software testing, testers need to write code snippets that execute the program under test. Recently, researchers have recognized the potential of large language models (LLMs) in software testing. However, there remains a lack of fair comparisons between different LLMs in terms of test case generation capabilities. In this paper, we propose TESTEVAL, a novel benchmark for test case generation with LLMs. We collect 210 Python programs from an online programming platform, LeetCode, and design three different tasks: overall coverage, targeted line/branch coverage, and targeted path coverage. We further evaluate sixteen popular LLMs, including both commercial and open-source ones, on TESTEVAL. We find that generating test cases to cover specific program lines/branches/paths is still challenging for current LLMs, indicating a lack of ability to comprehend program logic and execution paths. We have open-sourced our dataset and benchmark pipelines at https://github.com/LLM4SoftwareTesting/TestEval.</p></details> | <details><summary>In NA...</summary><p>In NAACL 2025 findings</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/LLM4SoftwareTesting/TestEval) |
| **[RGB-Event ISP: The Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19129v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-guided imaging has received significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize instant imaging systems. However, the prior methods primarily focus on enhancing RGB images in a post-processing manner, neglecting the challenges of image signal processor (ISP) dealing with event sensor and the benefits events provide for reforming the ISP process. To achieve this, we conduct the first research on event-guided ISP. First, we present a new event-RAW paired dataset, collected with a novel but still confidential sensor that records pixel-level aligned events and RAW images. This dataset includes 3373 RAW images with 2248 x 3264 resolution and their corresponding events, spanning 24 scenes with 3 exposure modes and 3 lenses. Second, we propose a conventional ISP pipeline to generate good RGB frames as reference. This conventional ISP pipleline performs basic ISP operations, e.g.demosaicing, white balancing, denoising and color space transforming, with a ColorChecker as reference. Third, we classify the existing learnable ISP methods into 3 classes, and select multiple methods to train and evaluate on our new dataset. Lastly, since there is no prior work for reference, we propose a simple event-guided ISP method and test it on our dataset. We further put forward key technical challenges and future directions in RGB-Event ISP. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this is the very first research focusing on event-guided ISP, and we hope it will inspire the community.

This cognitive theory provides a foundation for researching how robots can more effectively imitate human behavior. However, current research either employs multiple cameras with different views focusing on the same individual's behavior simultaneously or encounters unpair ego-exo view scenarios, there is no effort to fully exploit human cognitive behavior in the real world. To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce a novel large-scale egocentric dataset, called EgoMe, which towards following the process of human imitation learning via egocentric view in the real world. Our dataset includes 7902 pairs of videos (15804 videos) for diverse daily behaviors in real-world scenarios. For a pair of videos, one video captures a exocentric view of the imitator observing the demonstrator's actions, while the other captures a egocentric view of the imitator subsequently following those actions. Notably, our dataset also contain exo-ego eye gaze, angular velocity, acceleration, magnetic strength and other sensor multi-modal data for assisting in establishing correlations between observing and following process. In addition, we also propose eight challenging benchmark tasks for fully leveraging this data resource and promoting the research of robot imitation learning ability. Extensive statistical analysis demonstrates significant advantages compared to existing datasets. The proposed EgoMe dataset and benchmark will be released soon.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, in a data-driven era, the scarcity of large-scale datasets poses a significant bottleneck to advancing SAR automatic target recognition (ATR) technology. This paper introduces NUDT4MSTAR, a large-scale SAR dataset for remote sensing target recognition in the wild, including 40 vehicle target types and various imaging conditions across 5 realistic scenes. NUDT4MSTAR represents a significant leap forward in dataset scale, containing over 190,000 images-tenfold the size of its predecessors. We meticulously annotate each image with detailed target information and imaging conditions. Besides, data in both processed magnitude images and original complex formats are provided. Then, we construct a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7 experiments with 15 recognition methods focusing on the stable and effective ATR issues. Besides, we conduct transfer learning experiments utilizing various models training on NUDT4MSTAR and apply them to three other target datasets, demonstrating its substantial potential for the broader field of ground objects ATR. Finally, we discuss this dataset's application value and ATR's significant challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this work marks the first-ever endeavor to create a large-scale dataset benchmark for fine-grained SAR recognition in the wild, featuring an extensive collection of exhaustively annotated vehicle images. We expect that the open source of NUDT4MSTAR will facilitate the development of SAR ATR and attract a wider community of researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 14 figures; NUDT4MSTAR: https://github.com/waterdisappear/NUDT4MSTAR</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/waterdisappear/NUDT4MSTAR) |
| **[General Scene Adaptation for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17403v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks mainly evaluate agents based on one-time execution of individual instructions across multiple environments, aiming to develop agents capable of functioning in any environment in a zero-shot manner. However, real-world navigation robots often operate in persistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual observations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task setting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating continuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these real-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to execute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously adapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task, one has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD data, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each scene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly expands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R dataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts. Furthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that leverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing techniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is motivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent signatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various methods. Based on our findings, we propose a novel method, GR-DUET, which incorporates memory-based navigation graphs with an environment-specific training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on all GSA-R2R splits.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |
| **[Audio-Language Models for Audio-Centric Tasks: A survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15177v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-Language Models (ALMs), which are trained on audio-text data, focus on the processing, understanding, and reasoning of sounds. Unlike traditional supervised learning approaches learning from predefined labels, ALMs utilize natural language as a supervision signal, which is more suitable for describing complex real-world audio recordings. ALMs demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities and can be flexibly adapted to diverse downstream tasks. These strengths not only enhance the accuracy and generalization of audio processing tasks but also promote the development of models that more closely resemble human auditory perception and comprehension. Recent advances in ALMs have positioned them at the forefront of computer audition research, inspiring a surge of efforts to advance ALM technologies. Despite rapid progress in the field of ALMs, there is still a notable lack of systematic surveys that comprehensively organize and analyze developments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of ALMs with a focus on general audio tasks, aiming to fill this gap by providing a structured and holistic overview of ALMs. Specifically, we cover: (1) the background of computer audition and audio-language models; (2) the foundational aspects of ALMs, including prevalent network architectures, training objectives, and evaluation methods; (3) foundational pre-training and audio-language pre-training approaches; (4) task-specific fine-tuning, multi-task tuning and agent systems for downstream applications; (5) datasets and benchmarks; and (6) current challenges and future directions. Our review provides a clear technical roadmap for researchers to understand the development and future trends of existing technologies, offering valuable references for implementation in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

An emerging application is using LLMs to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These systems require LLMs to understand user queries, retrieve relevant information, and synthesize coherent and accurate responses. Given the increasing real-world deployment of such systems, comprehensive evaluation becomes crucial. To this end, we propose FRAMES (Factuality, Retrieval, And reasoning MEasurement Set), a high-quality evaluation dataset designed to test LLMs' ability to provide factual responses, assess retrieval capabilities, and evaluate the reasoning required to generate final answers. While previous work has provided datasets and benchmarks to evaluate these abilities in isolation, FRAMES offers a unified framework that provides a clearer picture of LLM performance in end-to-end RAG scenarios. Our dataset comprises challenging multi-hop questions that require the integration of information from multiple sources. We present baseline results demonstrating that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, achieving 0.40 accuracy with no retrieval. The accuracy is significantly improved with our proposed multi-step retrieval pipeline, achieving an accuracy of 0.66 (>50% improvement). We hope our work will help bridge evaluation gaps and assist in developing more robust and capable RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), 2025</p></details> | None |

However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</p></details> |  | None |

While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues. In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally. The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet. A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage. Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%. These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Performance of Point Cloud Completion Networks with Consistency Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07298v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud completion networks are conventionally trained to minimize the disparities between the completed point cloud and the ground-truth counterpart. However, an incomplete object-level point cloud can have multiple valid completion solutions when it is examined in isolation. This one-to-many mapping issue can cause contradictory supervision signals to the network because the loss function may produce different values for identical input-output pairs of the network. In many cases, this issue could adversely affect the network optimization process. In this work, we propose to enhance the conventional learning objective using a novel completion consistency loss to mitigate the one-to-many mapping problem. Specifically, the proposed consistency loss ensure that a point cloud completion network generates a coherent completion solution for incomplete objects originating from the same source point cloud. Experimental results across multiple well-established datasets and benchmarks demonstrated the proposed completion consistency loss have excellent capability to enhance the completion performance of various existing networks without any modification to the design of the networks. The proposed consistency loss enhances the performance of the point completion network without affecting the inference speed, thereby increasing the accuracy of point cloud completion. Notably, a state-of-the-art point completion network trained with the proposed consistency loss can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging new MVP dataset.

Recently, the emergence of video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has shown promise in general video understanding tasks. However, describing facial expressions within videos poses two major challenges for these models: (1) the lack of adequate datasets and benchmarks, and (2) the limited visual token capacity of video MLLMs. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new instruction-following dataset tailored for dynamic facial expression caption. The dataset comprises 5,033 high-quality video clips annotated manually, containing over 700,000 tokens. Its purpose is to improve the capability of video MLLMs to discern subtle facial nuances. Furthermore, we propose FaceTrack-MM, which leverages a limited number of tokens to encode the main character's face. This model demonstrates superior performance in tracking faces and focusing on the facial expressions of the main characters, even in intricate multi-person scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric combining event extraction, relation classification, and the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to assess the content consistency and temporal sequence consistency of generated text. Moreover, we present FEC-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of existing video MLLMs in this specific task.

However, existing MLLMs still face challenges in achieving precise grounding in complex multi-image scenarios. To address this, we first explore a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that integrates single-image grounding with multi-image comprehension. While partially effective, it remains unstable and struggles to capture abstract visual information due to its non-end-to-end nature. Therefore, we introduce Migician, the first multi-image grounding model capable of performing free-form and accurate grounding across multiple images. To support this, we present the MGrounding-630k dataset, which comprises data for several multi-image grounding tasks derived from existing datasets, along with newly generated free-form grounding instruction-following data. Furthermore, we propose MIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multi-image grounding capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significantly superior multi-image grounding capabilities, outperforming the best existing MLLMs by 21.61% and even surpassing much larger 70B models.

Traditional security measures often fall short, highlighting the need for intelligent solutions capable of detecting shoplifting behaviors in real time. This paper frames shoplifting detection as an anomaly detection problem, focusing on the identification of deviations from typical shopping patterns. We introduce PoseLift, a privacy-preserving dataset specifically designed for shoplifting detection, addressing challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and model biases. PoseLift is built in collaboration with a retail store and contains anonymized human pose data from real-world scenarios. By preserving essential behavioral information while anonymizing identities, PoseLift balances privacy and utility. We benchmark state-of-the-art pose-based anomaly detection models on this dataset, evaluating performance using a comprehensive set of metrics. Our results demonstrate that pose-based approaches achieve high detection accuracy while effectively addressing privacy and bias concerns inherent in traditional methods. As one of the first datasets capturing real-world shoplifting behaviors, PoseLift offers researchers a valuable tool to advance computer vision ethically and will be publicly available to foster innovation and collaboration.

In this paper, we present a novel and publicly available dataset named AutoFish designed for fine-grained fish analysis. The dataset comprises 1,500 images of 454 specimens of visually similar fish placed in various constellations on a white conveyor belt and annotated with instance segmentation masks, IDs, and length measurements.

This work provides an analysis of dataset development practices at NeurIPS through the lens of data curation. We present an evaluation framework for dataset documentation, consisting of a rubric and toolkit developed through a literature review of data curation principles.

Mobile GUI agents, a subset of AI agents, are designed to autonomously perform tasks on mobile devices. While numerous studies have introduced agents, datasets, and benchmarks to advance mobile GUI agent research, many existing datasets focus on static frame evaluations and fail to provide a comprehensive platform for assessing performance on real-world, in-the-wild tasks. To address this gap, we present Android Agent Arena (A3), a novel evaluation platform. Unlike existing in-the-wild systems, A3 offers: (1) meaningful and practical tasks, such as real-time online information retrieval and operational instructions; (2) a larger, more flexible action space, enabling compatibility with agents trained on any dataset; and (3) automated business-level LLM-based evaluation process. A3 includes 21 widely used general third-party apps and 201 tasks representative of common user scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating mobile GUI agents in real-world situations and a new autonomous evaluation process for less human labor and coding expertise.

However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

As these models increasingly integrate into our daily life, it is necessary to conduct moral evaluation to ensure that their outputs align with human values and remain within moral boundaries. Previous works primarily focus on LLMs, proposing moral datasets and benchmarks limited to text modality. However, given the rapid development of LVLMs, there is still a lack of multimodal moral evaluation methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce M$^3$oralBench, the first MultiModal Moral Benchmark for LVLMs. M$^3$oralBench expands the everyday moral scenarios in Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs) and employs the text-to-image diffusion model, SD3.0, to create corresponding scenario images. It conducts moral evaluation across six moral foundations of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and encompasses tasks in moral judgement, moral classification, and moral response, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in multimodal moral understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 popular open-source and closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that M$^3$oralBench is a challenging benchmark, exposing notable moral limitations in current models.

However, exploring and exploiting the extensive knowledge of these models to comprehend multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To fill this research gap, we first introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale multi-omics biological sequences-related instruction-tuning dataset including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules, designed to bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and complex biological sequences-related tasks. This dataset can enhance the versatility of LLMs by integrating diverse biological sequenced-based prediction tasks with advanced reasoning capabilities, while maintaining conversational fluency. Additionally, we reveal significant performance limitations in even state-of-the-art LLMs on biological sequence-related multi-omics tasks without specialized pre-training and instruction-tuning. We further develop a strong baseline called ChatMultiOmics with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating the powerful ability to understand biology by using Biology-Instructions.

However, PPG-based HR estimates can be substantially impacted by factors such as the wearer's activities, sensor placement and resulting motion artifacts, as well as environmental characteristics such as temperature and ambient light. These and other factors can significantly impact and decrease HR prediction reliability. In this paper, we show that state-of-the-art HR estimation methods struggle when processing \emph{representative} data from everyday activities in outdoor environments, likely because they rely on existing datasets that captured controlled conditions. We introduce a novel multimodal dataset and benchmark results for continuous PPG recordings during outdoor activities from 16 participants over 13.5 hours, captured from four wearable sensors, each worn at a different location on the body, totaling 216\,hours. Our recordings include accelerometer, temperature, and altitude data, as well as a synchronized Lead I-based electrocardiogram for ground-truth HR references. Participants completed a round trip from Zurich to Jungfraujoch, a tall mountain in Switzerland over the course of one day. The trip included outdoor and indoor activities such as walking, hiking, stair climbing, eating, drinking, and resting at various temperatures and altitudes (up to 3,571\,m above sea level) as well as using cars, trains, cable cars, and lifts for transport -- all of which impacted participants' physiological dynamics.

Moreover, existing urban benchmarks have been limited to evaluating LMMs with basic region-level urban tasks under singular views, leading to incomplete evaluations of LMMs' abilities in urban environments. To address these issues, we present UrBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating LMMs in complex multi-view urban scenarios. UrBench contains 11.6K meticulously curated questions at both region-level and role-level that cover 4 task dimensions: Geo-Localization, Scene Reasoning, Scene Understanding, and Object Understanding, totaling 14 task types. In constructing UrBench, we utilize data from existing datasets and additionally collect data from 11 cities, creating new annotations using a cross-view detection-matching method. With these images and annotations, we then integrate LMM-based, rule-based, and human-based methods to construct large-scale high-quality questions. Our evaluations on 21 LMMs show that current LMMs struggle in the urban environments in several aspects. Even the best performing GPT-4o lags behind humans in most tasks, ranging from simple tasks such as counting to complex tasks such as orientation, localization and object attribute recognition, with an average performance gap of 17.4%. Our benchmark also reveals that LMMs exhibit inconsistent behaviors with different urban views, especially with respect to understanding cross-view relations.

Usually, HSI needs to be calibrated to minimize the impact of various illumination conditions. The traditional way to calibrate HSI utilizes a physical reference, which involves manual operations, occlusions, and/or limits camera mobility. These limitations inspire this paper to automatically calibrate HSIs using a learning-based method. Towards this goal, a large-scale HSI calibration dataset is created, which has 765 high-quality HSI pairs covering diversified natural scenes and illuminations. The dataset is further expanded to 7650 pairs by combining with 10 different physically measured illuminations. A spectral illumination transformer (SIT) together with an illumination attention module is proposed. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate the SoTA performance of the proposed SIT.

This scale of radiological studies provides a significant opportunity to streamline CXR interpretation and documentation. While foundation models are a promising solution, the lack of publicly available large-scale datasets and benchmarks inhibits their iterative development and real-world evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we constructed a large-scale dataset (CheXinstruct), which we utilized to train a vision-language foundation model (CheXagent). We systematically demonstrated competitive performance across eight distinct task types on our novel evaluation benchmark (CheXbench). Beyond technical validation, we assessed the real-world utility of CheXagent in directly drafting radiology reports. Our clinical assessment with eight radiologists revealed a 36% time saving for residents using CheXagent-drafted reports, while attending radiologists showed no significant time difference editing resident-drafted or CheXagent-drafted reports. The CheXagent-drafted reports improved the writing efficiency of both radiology residents and attending radiologists in 81% and 61% of cases, respectively, without loss of quality. Overall, we demonstrate that CheXagent can effectively perform a variety of CXR interpretation tasks and holds potential to assist radiologists in routine clinical workflows.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures | None |

Despite notable advancements in the fields of video summarization and highlight detection, which can create partially usable short films from raw videos, these approaches are often domain-specific and require an in-depth understanding of real-world video content. To tackle this predicament, we propose Repurpose-10K, an extensive dataset comprising over 10,000 videos with more than 120,000 annotated clips aimed at resolving the video long-to-short task. Recognizing the inherent constraints posed by untrained human annotators, which can result in inaccurate annotations for repurposed videos, we propose a two-stage solution to obtain annotations from real-world user-generated content. Furthermore, we offer a baseline model to address this challenging task by integrating audio, visual, and caption aspects through a cross-modal fusion and alignment framework. We aspire for our work to ignite groundbreaking research in the lesser-explored realms of video repurposing.</p></details> | AAAI2025 | None |
| **[$\nabla^2$DFT: A Universal Quantum Chemistry Dataset of Drug-Like Molecules and a Benchmark for Neural Network Potentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14347v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods of computational quantum chemistry provide accurate approximations of molecular properties crucial for computer-aided drug discovery and other areas of chemical science. However, high computational complexity limits the scalability of their applications. Neural network potentials (NNPs) are a promising alternative to quantum chemistry methods, but they require large and diverse datasets for training. This work presents a new dataset and benchmark called $\nabla^2$DFT that is based on the nablaDFT. It contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. All calculations were performed at the DFT level ($\omega$B97X-D/def2-SVP) for each conformation. Moreover, $\nabla^2$DFT is the first dataset that contains relaxation trajectories for a substantial number of drug-like molecules. We also introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating NNPs in molecular property prediction, Hamiltonian prediction, and conformational optimization tasks. Finally, we propose an extendable framework for training NNPs and implement 10 models within it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS2024 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks (Poster)</p></details> | None |
| **[LCFO: Long Context and Long Form Output Dataset and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08268v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains. LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively). It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%). Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6). The LCFO benchmark offers a standardized platform for evaluating summarization and summary expansion performance, as well as corresponding automatic metrics, thereby providing an important evaluation framework to advance generative AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MultiEYE: Dataset and Benchmark for OCT-Enhanced Retinal Disease Recognition from Fundus Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09402v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-modal learning methods on fundus and OCT images mostly require both modalities to be available and strictly paired for training and testing, which appears less practical in clinical scenarios. To expand the scope of clinical applications, we formulate a novel setting, "OCT-enhanced disease recognition from fundus images", that allows for the use of unpaired multi-modal data during the training phase and relies on the widespread fundus photographs for testing. To benchmark this setting, we present the first large multi-modal multi-class dataset for eye disease diagnosis, MultiEYE, and propose an OCT-assisted Conceptual Distillation Approach (OCT-CoDA), which employs semantically rich concepts to extract disease-related knowledge from OCT images and leverage them into the fundus model. Specifically, we regard the image-concept relation as a link to distill useful knowledge from the OCT teacher model to the fundus student model, which considerably improves the diagnostic performance based on fundus images and formulates the cross-modal knowledge transfer into an explainable process. Through extensive experiments on the multi-disease classification task, our proposed OCT-CoDA demonstrates remarkable results and interpretability, showing great potential for clinical application.

To address this, we present a mobile robot oriented large-scale indoor dataset, denoted as THUD++ (TsingHua University Dynamic) robotic dataset, for dynamic scene understanding. Our current dataset includes 13 large-scale dynamic scenarios, combining both real-world and synthetic data collected with a real robot platform and a physical simulation platform, respectively. The RGB-D dataset comprises over 90K image frames, 20M 2D/3D bounding boxes of static and dynamic objects, camera poses, and IMU. The trajectory dataset covers over 6,000 pedestrian trajectories in indoor scenes. Additionally, the dataset is augmented with a Unity3D-based simulation platform, allowing researchers to create custom scenes and test algorithms in a controlled environment. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods on THUD++ across mainstream indoor scene understanding tasks, e.g., 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, relocalization, pedestrian trajectory prediction, and navigation. Our experiments highlight the challenges mobile robots encounter in indoor environments, especially when navigating in complex, crowded, and dynamic scenes. By sharing this dataset, we aim to accelerate the development and testing of mobile robot algorithms, contributing to real-world robotic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.19791</p></details> | None |
| **[A Dataset and Benchmark for Hospital Course Summarization with Adapted Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05720v4)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brief hospital course (BHC) summaries are clinical documents that summarize a patient's hospital stay. While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.</p></details> |  | None |

We present Wake Vision, a large-scale dataset for person detection that contains over 6 million quality-filtered images. We provide two variants: Wake Vision (Large) and Wake Vision (Quality), leveraging the large variant for pretraining and knowledge distillation, while the higher-quality labels drive final model performance. The manually labeled validation and test sets reduce error rates from 7.8% to 2.2% compared to previous standards. In addition, we introduce five detailed benchmark sets to evaluate model performance in real-world scenarios, including varying lighting, camera distances, and demographic characteristics. Training with Wake Vision improves accuracy by 1.93% over existing datasets, demonstrating the importance of dataset quality for low-capacity models and dataset size for high-capacity models.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their potential to simulate human behavior, enabling the replication of individual responses and facilitating studies on many interdisciplinary studies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the recent progress in simulation driven by LLM-empowered agents. We categorize the simulations into three types: (1) Individual Simulation, which mimics specific individuals or demographic groups; (2) Scenario Simulation, where multiple agents collaborate to achieve goals within specific contexts; and (3) Society Simulation, which models interactions within agent societies to reflect the complexity and variety of real-world dynamics. These simulations follow a progression, ranging from detailed individual modeling to large-scale societal phenomena. We provide a detailed discussion of each simulation type, including the architecture or key components of the simulation, the classification of objectives or scenarios and the evaluation method. Afterward, we summarize commonly used datasets and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the trends across these three types of simulation.

Existing language datasets for driving primarily capture interactions caused by close distances. However, interactions induced by traffic rules and human intentions, which can occur over long distances, are yet sufficiently covered. To address this, WOMD-Reasoning presents by far the largest multi-modal Q&A dataset on real-world driving scenarios, covering a wide range of driving topics from map descriptions and motion status descriptions to narratives and analyses of agents' interactions, behaviors, and intentions. We further introduce Motion-LLaVA, a motion-language model fine-tuned on the proposed dataset with robust interaction reasoning capabilities. We benchmark its performance across various configurations including different input modalities, reasoning techniques, and network architectures. The robust, diverse, and multi-modal nature of WOMD-Reasoning highlights its potential to advance future autonomous driving research and enable a broad range of applications.

This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, grounding-IQA. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates the model grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed task paradigm, dataset, and benchmark facilitate the more fine-grained IQA application.

However, existing TAG datasets predominantly feature textual information only at the nodes, with edges typically represented by mere binary or categorical attributes. This lack of rich textual edge annotations significantly limits the exploration of contextual relationships between entities, hindering deeper insights into graph-structured data. To address this gap, we introduce Textual-Edge Graphs Datasets and Benchmark (TEG-DB), a comprehensive and diverse collection of benchmark textual-edge datasets featuring rich textual descriptions on nodes and edges. The TEG-DB datasets are large-scale and encompass a wide range of domains, from citation networks to social networks. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on TEG-DB to assess the extent to which current techniques, including pre-trained language models, graph neural networks, and their combinations, can utilize textual node and edge information. Our goal is to elicit advancements in textual-edge graph research, specifically in developing methodologies that exploit rich textual node and edge descriptions to enhance graph analysis and provide deeper insights into complex real-world networks.

However, this ISA shift poses significant challenges, mainly due to the extensive legacy ecosystem of x86 software and lack of portability across proprietary ecosystems and software stacks. This paper introduces CRT, a lightweight LLM-based transpiler that automatically converts x86 assembly to ARM assembly. Our approach bridges the fundamental architectural gap between x86's CISC-based and ARM's RISC-based computing paradigms while preserving program semantics and optimizing performance. We evaluate CRT on diverse real-world applications, achieving 79.25% translation accuracy from x86 to ARMv5 on our comprehensive test suite, and an 88.68% accuracy from x86 to RISC-V. In practical deployments on Apple M2 hardware (ARMv8), our transpiled code achieves 1.73$\times$ speedup compared to Apple's Rosetta 2 virtualization engine, while delivering 2.41$\times$ memory efficiency and 1.47$\times$ better energy consumption. Through testing and analysis, we show that CRT successfully navigates the CISC/RISC divide and generates correctly executable RISC code despite machine ``language'' barriers.

With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future research development, where the detailed analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly.

However, the inherent challenges of vascular imaging, such as sparsity, fine granularity, low contrast, data distribution variability, and the critical need for preserving topological structure, making generalized vessel segmentation particularly complex. While specialized segmentation methods have been developed for specific anatomical regions, their over-reliance on tailored models hinders broader applicability and generalization. General-purpose segmentation models introduced in medical imaging often fail to address critical vascular characteristics, including the connectivity of segmentation results. To overcome these limitations, we propose an optimized vessel segmentation framework: a structure-agnostic approach incorporating small vessel enhancement and morphological correction for multi-modality vessel segmentation. To train and validate this framework, we compiled a comprehensive multi-modality dataset spanning 17 datasets and benchmarked our model against six SAM-based methods and 17 expert models. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy, generalization, and a 34.6% improvement in connectivity, underscoring its clinical potential. An ablation study further validates the effectiveness of the proposed improvements. We will release the code and dataset at github following the publication of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figurres, submitted to TIP</p></details> | None |

However, they face a significant challenge: hallucinations, where models produce plausible-sounding but factually incorrect responses. This undermines trust and limits the applicability of LLMs in different domains. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), on the other hand, provide a structured collection of interconnected facts represented as entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). In recent research, KGs have been leveraged to provide context that can fill gaps in an LLM understanding of certain topics offering a promising approach to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, enhancing their reliability and accuracy while benefiting from their wide applicability. Nonetheless, it is still a very active area of research with various unresolved open problems. In this paper, we discuss these open challenges covering state-of-the-art datasets and benchmarks as well as methods for knowledge integration and evaluating hallucinations. In our discussion, we consider the current use of KGs in LLM systems and identify future directions within each of these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> | None |

Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and overcoming occlusions, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In recent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged. However, these datasets only focus on camera and LiDAR, overlooking 4D Radar, a sensor employed in single-vehicle autonomous driving for robust perception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap of missing 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we present V2X-Radar, the first large real-world multi-modal dataset featuring 4D Radar. Our V2X-Radar dataset is collected using a connected vehicle platform and an intelligent roadside unit equipped with 4D Radar, LiDAR, and multi-view cameras. The collected data includes sunny and rainy weather conditions, spanning daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as typical challenging scenarios. The dataset comprises 20K LiDAR frames, 40K camera images, and 20K 4D Radar data, with 350K annotated bounding boxes across five categories. To facilitate diverse research domains, we establish V2X-Radar-C for cooperative perception, V2X-Radar-I for roadside perception, and V2X-Radar-V for single-vehicle perception. We further provide comprehensive benchmarks of recent perception algorithms on the above three sub-datasets.

Prior research on purchase reason has relied on surveys to gather data from users. However, this method is limited in scalability, often focusing on specific products or brands, and may not accurately represent the broader population due to the restricted number of participants involved. In our work, we propose purchase reason prediction as a novel task for modern AI models. To benchmark potential AI solutions for this new task, we first generate a dataset that consists of real-world explanations of why users make certain purchase decisions for various products. Our approach induces LLMs to explicitly distinguish between the reasons behind purchasing a product and the experience after the purchase in a user review. An automated, LLM-driven evaluation as well as a small scale human evaluation confirm the effectiveness of this approach to obtaining high-quality, personalized purchase reasons and post-purchase experiences. With this novel dataset, we are able to benchmark the purchase reason prediction task using various LLMs. Moreover, we demonstrate how purchase reasons can be valuable for downstream applications, such as marketing-focused user behavior analysis, post-purchase experience and rating prediction in recommender systems, and serving as a new approach to justify recommendations.</p></details> |  | None |

The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems.

USTC-TD contains 40 images at 4K spatial resolution and 10 video sequences at 1080p spatial resolution, featuring various content due to the diverse environmental factors (e.g. scene type, texture, motion, view) and the designed imaging factors (e.g. illumination, lens, shadow). We quantitatively evaluate USTC-TD on different image/video features (spatial, temporal, color, lightness), and compare it with the previous image/video test datasets, which verifies the wider coverage and more diversity of the proposed dataset. We also evaluate both classic standardized and recent learned image/video coding schemes on USTC-TD with PSNR and MS-SSIM, and provide an extensive benchmark for the evaluated schemes. Based on the characteristics and specific design of the proposed test dataset, we analyze the benchmark performance and shed light on the future research and development of image/video coding.

Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical Machine Learning and other Deep Learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages.

Accurate analysis of 3D dental scans is essential for orthodontic and prosthetic treatment planning, as it enables automated processing and reduces the need for manual adjustments by dental professionals. However, developing robust automated tools for these tasks remains a significant challenge due to the limited availability of high-quality public datasets and benchmarks. This article introduces Teeth3DS+, the first comprehensive public benchmark designed to advance the field of intraoral 3D scan analysis. Developed as part of the 3DTeethSeg 2022 and 3DTeethLand 2024 MICCAI challenges, Teeth3DS+ aims to drive research in teeth identification, segmentation, labeling, 3D modeling, and dental landmarks identification. The dataset includes at least 1,800 intraoral scans (containing 23,999 annotated teeth) collected from 900 patients, covering both upper and lower jaws separately. All data have been acquired and validated by experienced orthodontists and dental surgeons with over five years of expertise.

Yet, few text embeddings specialized for finance have been reported in the literature, perhaps in part due to a lack of public datasets and benchmarks. We present BAM embeddings, a set of text embeddings finetuned on a carefully constructed dataset of 14.3M query-passage pairs. Demonstrating the benefits of domain-specific training, BAM embeddings achieve Recall@1 of 62.8% on a held-out test set, vs. only 39.2% for the best general-purpose text embedding from OpenAI. Further, BAM embeddings increase question answering accuracy by 8% on FinanceBench and show increased sensitivity to the finance-specific elements that are found in detailed, forward-looking and company and date-specific queries. To support further research we describe our approach in detail, quantify the importance of hard negative mining and dataset scale.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 | None |

To help address this, we introduce ASL STEM Wiki: a parallel corpus of 254 Wikipedia articles on STEM topics in English, interpreted into over 300 hours of American Sign Language (ASL). ASL STEM Wiki is the first continuous signing dataset focused on STEM, facilitating the development of AI resources for STEM education in ASL. We identify several use cases of ASL STEM Wiki with human-centered applications. For example, because this dataset highlights the frequent use of fingerspelling for technical concepts, which inhibits DHH students' ability to learn, we develop models to identify fingerspelled words -- which can later be used to query for appropriate ASL signs to suggest to interpreters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024</p></details> | None |

These datasets are typically developed without using domain knowledge. In this paper, we release a novel dataset, VTechAGP, which is the first academic-to-general-audience text paraphrase dataset consisting of 4,938 document-level these and dissertation academic and general-audience abstract pairs from 8 colleges authored over 25 years. We also propose a novel dynamic soft prompt generative language model, DSPT5. For training, we leverage a contrastive-generative loss function to learn the keyword vectors in the dynamic prompt. For inference, we adopt a crowd-sampling decoding strategy at both semantic and structural levels to further select the best output candidate. We evaluate DSPT5 and various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) from multiple perspectives. Results demonstrate that the SOTA LLMs does not provide satisfactory outcomes, while the lightweight DSPT5 can achieve competitive results.

By enhancing these capabilities, humans can more effectively utilize data, leading to better comprehension and learning outcomes. Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on question answering, often neglecting the full potential of questioning and assessment skills. Inspired by the human learning mechanism, we introduce LOVA3, an innovative framework named "Learning tO Visual question Answering, Asking and Assessment," designed to equip MLLMs with these additional capabilities. Our approach involves the creation of two supplementary training tasks GenQA and EvalQA, aiming at fostering the skills of asking and assessing questions in the context of images. To develop the questioning ability, we compile a comprehensive set of multimodal foundational tasks. For assessment, we introduce a new benchmark called EvalQABench, comprising 64,000 training samples (split evenly between positive and negative samples) and 5,000 validation and testing samples. We posit that enhancing MLLMs with the capabilities to answer, ask, and assess questions will enhance their multimodal comprehension, ultimately improving overall performance. To validate this hypothesis, we train MLLMs using the LOVA3 framework and evaluate them on a range of multimodal datasets and benchmarks. Our results demonstrate consistent performance gains, underscoring the critical role of these additional tasks in fostering comprehensive intelligence in MLLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/LOVA3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

Our dataset has unique properties that are uncommon to current benchmarks for 2D and 3D puzzle solving. The fragments and fractures are realistic, caused by a collapse of a fresco during a World War II bombing at the Pompeii archaeological park. The fragments are also eroded and have missing pieces with irregular shapes and different dimensions, challenging further the reassembly algorithms. The dataset is multi-modal providing high resolution images with characteristic pictorial elements, detailed 3D scans of the fragments and meta-data annotated by the archaeologists. Ground truth has been generated through several years of unceasing fieldwork, including the excavation and cleaning of each fragment, followed by manual puzzle solving by archaeologists of a subset of approx. 1000 pieces among the 16000 available. After digitizing all the fragments in 3D, a benchmark was prepared to challenge current reassembly and puzzle-solving methods that often solve more simplistic synthetic scenarios. The tested baselines show that there clearly exists a gap to fill in solving this computationally complex problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024, Track Datasets and Benchmarks, 10 pages</p></details> | None |

However, they often lack interpretability and struggle with complex visual inputs, especially when the resolution of the input image is high or when the interested region that could provide key information for answering the question is small. To address these challenges, we collect and introduce the large-scale Visual CoT dataset comprising 438k question-answer pairs, annotated with intermediate bounding boxes highlighting key regions essential for answering the questions. Additionally, about 98k pairs of them are annotated with detailed reasoning steps. Importantly, we propose a multi-turn processing pipeline that dynamically focuses on visual inputs and provides interpretable thoughts. We also introduce the related benchmark to evaluate the MLLMs in scenarios requiring specific local region identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better inference strategies.

Although ethics reviews, documentation, and checklists have been established, it remains uncertain whether consistent dataset management practices exist across the community. This lack of a comprehensive overview hinders our ability to diagnose and address fundamental tensions and ethical issues related to managing large datasets. We present a systematic review of datasets published at the NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks track, focusing on four key aspects: provenance, distribution, ethical disclosure, and licensing. Our findings reveal that dataset provenance is often unclear due to ambiguous filtering and curation processes. Additionally, a variety of sites are used for dataset hosting, but only a few offer structured metadata and version control. These inconsistencies underscore the urgent need for standardized data infrastructures for the publication and management of datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 tables | None |

A major challenge in current cloud removal research is the absence of a comprehensive benchmark and a sufficiently large and diverse training dataset. To address this problem, we introduce the largest public dataset -- $\textit{AllClear}$ for cloud removal, featuring 23,742 globally distributed regions of interest (ROIs) with diverse land-use patterns, comprising 4 million images in total.

However, The NAS methods require high computational costs due to the high dimension search space and the need to train multiple candidate solutions. This paper introduces LCoDeepNEAT, an instantiation of Lamarckian genetic algorithms, which extends the foundational principles of the CoDeepNEAT framework. LCoDeepNEAT co-evolves CNN architectures and their respective final layer weights. The evaluation process of LCoDeepNEAT entails a single epoch of SGD, followed by the transference of the acquired final layer weights to the genetic representation of the network. In addition, it expedites the process of evolving by imposing restrictions on the architecture search space, specifically targeting architectures comprising just two fully connected layers for classification. Our method yields a notable improvement in the classification accuracy of candidate solutions throughout the evolutionary process, ranging from 2% to 5.6%. This outcome underscores the efficacy and effectiveness of integrating gradient information and evolving the last layer of candidate solutions within LCoDeepNEAT. LCoDeepNEAT is assessed across six standard image classification datasets and benchmarked against eight leading NAS methods. Results demonstrate LCoDeepNEAT's ability to swiftly discover competitive CNN architectures with fewer parameters, conserving computational resources, and achieving superior classification accuracy compared to other approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to prohibitively high cost in time and money, there is still lack of open-source and large-scale benchmarks in this field. It is mainly the case for airfoil inverse design, which requires to generate and edit diverse geometric-qualified and aerodynamic-qualified airfoils following the multimodal instructions, \emph{i.e.,} dragging points and physical parameters. This paper presents the open-source endeavors in airfoil inverse design, \emph{AFBench}, including a large-scale dataset with 200 thousand airfoils and high-quality aerodynamic and geometric labels, two novel and practical airfoil inverse design tasks, \emph{i.e.,} conditional generation on multimodal physical parameters, controllable editing, and comprehensive metrics to evaluate various existing airfoil inverse design methods. Our aim is to establish \emph{AFBench} as an ecosystem for training and evaluating airfoil inverse design methods, with a specific focus on data-driven controllable inverse design models by multimodal instructions capable of bridging the gap between ideas and execution, the academic research and industrial applications.

Off-road environments are rich in geometric information, therefore it is suitable for 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks to reconstruct such scenes. However, most of researches concentrate on on-road environments, and few methods are designed for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction due to the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In response to this gap, we introduce WildOcc, to our knowledge, the first benchmark to provide dense occupancy annotations for off-road 3D semantic occupancy prediction tasks. A ground truth generation pipeline is proposed in this paper, which employs a coarse-to-fine reconstruction to achieve a more realistic result. Moreover, we introduce a multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework, which fuses spatio-temporal information from multi-frame images and point clouds at voxel level. In addition, a cross-modality distillation function is introduced, which transfers geometric knowledge from point clouds to image features.</p></details> |  | None |

However, generating diverse remote sensing (RS) images that are tremendously different from general images in terms of scale and perspective remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of a comprehensive remote sensing image generation dataset with various modalities, ground sample distances (GSD), and scenes. In this paper, we propose a Multi-modal, Multi-GSD, Multi-scene Remote Sensing (MMM-RS) dataset and benchmark for text-to-image generation in diverse remote sensing scenarios. Specifically, we first collect nine publicly available RS datasets and conduct standardization for all samples. To bridge RS images to textual semantic information, we utilize a large-scale pretrained vision-language model to automatically output text prompts and perform hand-crafted rectification, resulting in information-rich text-image pairs (including multi-modal images). In particular, we design some methods to obtain the images with different GSD and various environments (e.g., low-light, foggy) in a single sample. With extensive manual screening and refining annotations, we ultimately obtain a MMM-RS dataset that comprises approximately 2.1 million text-image pairs. Extensive experimental results verify that our proposed MMM-RS dataset allows off-the-shelf diffusion models to generate diverse RS images across various modalities, scenes, weather conditions, and GSD.

Considering the diversity of sign languages across geographical regions, developing region-specific ISLR datasets is crucial for supporting communication and research. Auslan, as a sign language specific to Australia, still lacks a dedicated large-scale word-level dataset for the ISLR task. To fill this gap, we curate \underline{\textbf{the first}} large-scale Multi-view Multi-modal Word-Level Australian Sign Language recognition dataset, dubbed MM-WLAuslan. Compared to other publicly available datasets, MM-WLAuslan exhibits three significant advantages: (1) the largest amount of data, (2) the most extensive vocabulary, and (3) the most diverse of multi-modal camera views. Specifically, we record 282K+ sign videos covering 3,215 commonly used Auslan glosses presented by 73 signers in a studio environment. Moreover, our filming system includes two different types of cameras, i.e., three Kinect-V2 cameras and a RealSense camera. We position cameras hemispherically around the front half of the model and simultaneously record videos using all four cameras. Furthermore, we benchmark results with state-of-the-art methods for various multi-modal ISLR settings on MM-WLAuslan, including multi-view, cross-camera, and cross-view. Experiment results indicate that MM-WLAuslan is a challenging ISLR dataset, and we hope this dataset will contribute to the development of Auslan and the advancement of sign languages worldwide.

Existing algorithms are often developed and evaluated using idealized datasets, which deviate significantly from real-life scenarios characterized by environmental noise and data corruption such as fluctuating lighting conditions, variable object poses, and unstable camera positions. To address this gap, we introduce the Realistic Anomaly Detection (RAD) dataset, the first multi-view RGB-based anomaly detection dataset specifically collected using a real robot arm, providing unique and realistic data scenarios. RAD comprises 4765 images across 13 categories and 4 defect types, collected from more than 50 viewpoints, providing a comprehensive and realistic benchmark. This multi-viewpoint setup mirrors real-world conditions where anomalies may not be detectable from every perspective. Moreover, by sampling varying numbers of views, the algorithm's performance can be comprehensively evaluated across different viewpoints. This approach enhances the thoroughness of performance assessment and helps improve the algorithm's robustness. Besides, to support 3D multi-view reconstruction algorithms, we propose a data augmentation method to improve the accuracy of pose estimation and facilitate the reconstruction of 3D point clouds. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art RGB-based and point cloud-based models using RAD, identifying limitations and future research directions.

Vehicle Color Recognition (VCR) has garnered significant research interest because color is a visually distinguishable attribute of vehicles and is less affected by partial occlusion and changes in viewpoint. Despite the success of existing methods for this task, the relatively low complexity of the datasets used in the literature has been largely overlooked. This research addresses this gap by compiling a new dataset representing a more challenging VCR scenario. The images - sourced from six license plate recognition datasets - are categorized into eleven colors, and their annotations were validated using official vehicle registration information. We evaluate the performance of four deep learning models on a widely adopted dataset and our proposed dataset to establish a benchmark. The results demonstrate that our dataset poses greater difficulty for the tested models and highlights scenarios that require further exploration in VCR. Remarkably, nighttime scenes account for a significant portion of the errors made by the best-performing model. This research provides a foundation for future studies on VCR, while also offering valuable insights for the field of fine-grained vehicle classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI) 2024</p></details> | None |

However, to date, few benchmarks and methods have focused on complex ADLs, especially those involving multi-person interactions in home environments. In this paper, we propose a new dataset and benchmark, InteractADL, for understanding complex ADLs that involve interaction between humans (and objects). Furthermore, complex ADLs occurring in home environments comprise a challenging long-tailed distribution due to the rarity of multi-person interactions, and pose fine-grained visual recognition tasks due to the presence of semantically and visually similar classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for fine-grained few-shot video classification called Name Tuning that enables greater semantic separability by learning optimal class name vectors. We show that Name Tuning can be combined with existing prompt tuning strategies to learn the entire input text (rather than only learning the prompt or class names) and demonstrate improved performance for few-shot classification on InteractADL and 4 other fine-grained visual classification benchmarks.

Our analysis shifts from traditional graphics and 2D computer vision to the perspective of point clouds, highlighting the inefficient spatial distribution of Gaussian representation as a key limitation in model performance. To address this, we introduce strategies for densification including blur split and depth reinitialization, and simplification through intersection preserving and sampling. These techniques reorganize the spatial positions of the Gaussians, resulting in significant improvements across various datasets and benchmarks in terms of rendering quality, resource consumption, and storage compression. Our Mini-Splatting integrates seamlessly with the original rasterization pipeline, providing a strong baseline for future research in Gaussian-Splatting-based works. \href{https://github.com/fatPeter/mini-splatting}{Code is available}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/fatPeter/mini-splatting) |

However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, effectively reasoning about complex spatial relations and functioning as a region-aware dense reward annotator for robotic tasks.

This is particularly problematic for time-series weather forecasting, where commonly used datasets suffer from significant limitations such as small size, limited temporal coverage, and sparse spatial distribution. These constraints severely impede the optimization and evaluation of TSF models, resulting in benchmarks that are not representative of real-world applications, such as operational weather forecasting. In this work, we introduce the WEATHER-5K dataset, a comprehensive collection of observational weather data that better reflects real-world scenarios. As a result, it enables a better training of models and a more accurate assessment of the real-world forecasting capabilities of TSF models, pushing them closer to in-situ applications. Through extensive benchmarking against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, we provide researchers with a clear assessment of the gap between academic TSF models and real-world weather forecasting applications. This highlights the significant performance disparity between TSF and NWP models by analyzing performance across detailed weather variables, extreme weather event prediction, and model complexity comparison. Finally, we summarise the result into recommendations to the users and highlight potential areas required to facilitate further TSF research.

As machine learning models have evolved from small to large pre-trained architectures, and from supporting unimodal to multimodal data, multimodal continual learning (MMCL) methods have recently emerged. The primary challenge of MMCL is that it goes beyond a simple stacking of unimodal CL methods, as such straightforward approaches often yield unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survey on MMCL. We provide essential background knowledge and MMCL settings, as well as a structured taxonomy of MMCL methods. We categorize existing MMCL methods into four categories, i.e., regularization-based, architecture-based, replay-based, and prompt-based methods, explaining their methodologies and highlighting their key innovations. Additionally, to prompt further research in this field, we summarize open MMCL datasets and benchmarks, and discuss several promising future directions for investigation and development. We have also created a GitHub repository for indexing relevant MMCL papers and open resources available at https://github.com/LucyDYu/Awesome-Multimodal-Continual-Learning.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/LucyDYu/Awesome-Multimodal-Continual-Learning) |

Recent studies advanced AML through the lens of graph-based machine learning, modeling the web of financial transactions as a graph and developing graph methods to identify suspicious activities. For instance, a recent effort on opensourcing datasets and benchmarks, Elliptic2, treats a set of Bitcoin addresses, considered to be controlled by the same entity, as a graph node and transactions among entities as graph edges. This modeling reveals the "shape" of a money laundering scheme - a subgraph on the blockchain. Despite the attractive subgraph classification results benchmarked by the paper, competitive methods remain expensive to apply due to the massive size of the graph; moreover, existing methods require candidate subgraphs as inputs which may not be available in practice. In this work, we introduce RevTrack, a graph-based framework that enables large-scale AML analysis with a lower cost and a higher accuracy. The key idea is to track the initial senders and the final receivers of funds; these entities offer a strong indication of the nature (licit vs. suspicious) of their respective subgraph. Based on this framework, we propose RevClassify, which is a neural network model for subgraph classification. Additionally, we address the practical problem where subgraph candidates are not given, by proposing RevFilter. This method identifies new suspicious subgraphs by iteratively filtering licit transactions, using RevClassify. Benchmarking these methods on Elliptic2, a new standard for AML, we show that RevClassify outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph classification techniques in both cost and accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RevFilter in discovering new suspicious subgraphs, confirming its utility for practical AML.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICAIF...</summary><p>ICAIF 2024.

Audio-driven 3D facial animation has been widely explored with promising results. However, multi-modal 3D facial animation, especially text-guided 3D facial animation is rarely explored due to the lack of multi-modal 3D facial animation dataset. To fill this gap, we first construct a large-scale multi-modal 3D facial animation dataset, MMHead, which consists of 49 hours of 3D facial motion sequences, speech audios, and rich hierarchical text annotations. Each text annotation contains abstract action and emotion descriptions, fine-grained facial and head movements (i.e., expression and head pose) descriptions, and three possible scenarios that may cause such emotion. Concretely, we integrate five public 2D portrait video datasets, and propose an automatic pipeline to 1) reconstruct 3D facial motion sequences from monocular videos; and 2) obtain hierarchical text annotations with the help of AU detection and ChatGPT. Based on the MMHead dataset, we establish benchmarks for two new tasks: text-induced 3D talking head animation and text-to-3D facial motion generation. Moreover, a simple but efficient VQ-VAE-based method named MM2Face is proposed to unify the multi-modal information and generate diverse and plausible 3D facial motions, which achieves competitive results on both benchmarks. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the significant potential of our dataset and benchmarks in promoting the development of multi-modal 3D facial animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2024.

However, existing image-text data may not support the precise modality alignment and integration of multi-grained information, which is crucial for human-centric visual understanding. In this paper, we introduce HERM-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the human-centric understanding capabilities of MLLMs. Our work reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in understanding complex human-centric scenarios. To address these challenges, we present HERM-100K, a comprehensive dataset with multi-level human-centric annotations, aimed at enhancing MLLMs' training. Furthermore, we develop HERM-7B, a MLLM that leverages enhanced training data from HERM-100K. Evaluations on HERM-Bench demonstrate that HERM-7B significantly outperforms existing MLLMs across various human-centric dimensions, reflecting the current inadequacy of data annotations used in MLLM training for human-centric visual understanding. This research emphasizes the importance of specialized datasets and benchmarks in advancing the MLLMs' capabilities for human-centric understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus mainly on basic charts and limited science subjects, lacking comprehensive evaluations. To address this, we curated a multimodal, multidisciplinary dataset from peer-reviewed, open-access Nature Communications articles, spanning 72 scientific disciplines. This dataset includes figures such as schematic diagrams, simulated images, macroscopic/microscopic photos, and experimental visualizations (e.g., western blots), which often require graduate-level, discipline-specific expertise to interpret. We developed benchmarks for scientific figure captioning and multiple-choice questions, evaluating six proprietary and over ten open-source models across varied settings. The results highlight the high difficulty of these tasks and the significant performance gap among models. While many open-source models performed at chance level on the multiple-choice task, some matched the performance of proprietary models. However, the gap was more pronounced in the captioning task. Our dataset also provide valuable resource for training. Fine-tuning the Qwen2-VL-2B model with our task-specific multimodal training data improved its multiple-choice accuracy to a level comparable to GPT-4o, though captioning remains challenging. Continuous pre-training of MLLMs using our interleaved article and figure data enhanced their material generation capabilities, demonstrating potential for integrating scientific knowledge.

There is considerable scope for improvement in both datasets and methods within this area. Recent learning-based methods often focus on optimizing performance for independent stereo pairs, leading to temporal inconsistencies in videos. Existing video methods typically employ sliding window operation over time dimension, which can result in low-frequency oscillations corresponding to the window size. To address these challenges, we propose a bidirectional alignment mechanism for adjacent frames as a fundamental operation. Building on this, we introduce a novel video processing framework, BiDAStereo, and a plugin stabilizer network, BiDAStabilizer, compatible with general image-based methods. Regarding datasets, current synthetic object-based and indoor datasets are commonly used for training and benchmarking, with a lack of outdoor nature scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present a realistic synthetic dataset and benchmark focused on natural scenes, along with a real-world dataset captured by a stereo camera in diverse urban scenes for qualitative evaluation. Extensive experiments on in-domain, out-of-domain, and robustness evaluation demonstrate the contribution of our methods and datasets, showcasing improvements in prediction quality and achieving state-of-the-art results on various commonly used benchmarks.

However, existing semantic perception datasets often lack important non-camera modalities typically used in autonomous vehicles, or they do not exploit such modalities to aid and improve semantic annotations in challenging conditions. To address this, we introduce MUSES, the MUlti-SEnsor Semantic perception dataset for driving in adverse conditions under increased uncertainty. MUSES includes synchronized multimodal recordings with 2D panoptic annotations for 2500 images captured under diverse weather and illumination. The dataset integrates a frame camera, a lidar, a radar, an event camera, and an IMU/GNSS sensor. Our new two-stage panoptic annotation protocol captures both class-level and instance-level uncertainty in the ground truth and enables the novel task of uncertainty-aware panoptic segmentation we introduce, along with standard semantic and panoptic segmentation. MUSES proves both effective for training and challenging for evaluating models under diverse visual conditions, and it opens new avenues for research in multimodal and uncertainty-aware dense semantic perception.

To facilitate the creation of such multi-task model, we have curated MultiMedBench, a comprehensive pretaining dataset and benchmark consisting of several distinct tasks, i.e., continuous question-answering, multi-label disease classification, disease localization, generation and summarization of radiology reports. MedViLaM demonstrates strong performance across all MultiMedBench tasks, frequently outpacing other generalist models by a significant margin.

Traditionally, racing cars rely on 2D LiDAR as their primary visual system. In this work, we explore the integration of an event camera with the existing system to provide enhanced temporal information. Our goal is to fuse the 2D LiDAR data with event data in an end-to-end learning framework for steering prediction, which is crucial for autonomous racing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study addressing this challenging research topic. We start by creating a multisensor dataset specifically for steering prediction. Using this dataset, we establish a benchmark by evaluating various SOTA fusion methods. Our observations reveal that existing methods often incur substantial computational costs. To address this, we apply low-rank techniques to propose a novel, efficient, and effective fusion design. We introduce a new fusion learning policy to guide the fusion process, enhancing robustness against misalignment. Our fusion architecture provides better steering prediction than LiDAR alone, significantly reducing the RMSE from 7.72 to 1.28. Compared to the second-best fusion method, our work represents only 11% of the learnable parameters while achieving better accuracy. The source code, dataset, and benchmark will be released to promote future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, food is inextricably linked to people's lives, making it a vital research area for practical applications such as dietary management. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, not only in their vast knowledge but also in their ability to handle languages naturally. While English is predominantly used, they can also support multiple languages including Japanese. This suggests that MLLMs are expected to significantly improve performance in food image understanding tasks. We fine-tuned open MLLMs LLaVA-1.5 and Phi-3 Vision on a Japanese recipe dataset and benchmarked their performance against the closed model GPT-4o. We then evaluated the content of generated recipes, including ingredients and cooking procedures, using 5,000 evaluation samples that comprehensively cover Japanese food culture.

Despite strong generalization in some respects, agents are often remarkably brittle to minor visual variations in control-irrelevant factors such as the background or camera viewpoint. In this paper, we present theDeepMind Control Visual Benchmark (DMC-VB), a dataset collected in the DeepMind Control Suite to evaluate the robustness of offline RL agents for solving continuous control tasks from visual input in the presence of visual distractors. In contrast to prior works, our dataset (a) combines locomotion and navigation tasks of varying difficulties, (b) includes static and dynamic visual variations, (c) considers data generated by policies with different skill levels, (d) systematically returns pairs of state and pixel observation, (e) is an order of magnitude larger, and (f) includes tasks with hidden goals. Accompanying our dataset, we propose three benchmarks to evaluate representation learning methods for pretraining, and carry out experiments on several recently proposed methods. First, we find that pretrained representations do not help policy learning on DMC-VB, and we highlight a large representation gap between policies learned on pixel observations and on states. Second, we demonstrate when expert data is limited, policy learning can benefit from representations pretrained on (a) suboptimal data, and (b) tasks with stochastic hidden goals.

However, robots are often required to perform tasks in different domains with respect to the training one and need to adapt to these changes. Tiny mobile robots, subject to size, power, and computational constraints, encounter even more difficulties in running and adapting these algorithms. Such adaptability, though, is crucial for real-world deployment, where robots must operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable settings. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark to evaluate the continual learning capabilities of object detection systems in tiny robotic platforms.

Typically, differentiable rendering relies on a dense viewpoint coverage of the scene, such that the geometry can be disambiguated from appearance observations alone. Several challenges arise when only a few input views are available, often referred to as sparse or few-shot neural rendering. As this is an underconstrained problem, most existing approaches introduce the use of regularisation, together with a diversity of learnt and hand-crafted priors. A recurring problem in sparse rendering literature is the lack of an homogeneous, up-to-date, dataset and evaluation protocol. While high-resolution datasets are standard in dense reconstruction literature, sparse rendering methods often evaluate with low-resolution images. Additionally, data splits are inconsistent across different manuscripts, and testing ground-truth images are often publicly available, which may lead to over-fitting. In this work, we propose the Sparse Rendering (SpaRe) dataset and benchmark. We introduce a new dataset that follows the setup of the DTU MVS dataset. The dataset is composed of 97 new scenes based on synthetic, high-quality assets. Each scene has up to 64 camera views and 7 lighting configurations, rendered at 1600x1200 resolution. We release a training split of 82 scenes to foster generalizable approaches, and provide an online evaluation platform for the validation and test sets, whose ground-truth images remain hidden. We propose two different sparse configurations (3 and 9 input images respectively). This provides a powerful and convenient tool for reproducible evaluation, and enable researchers easy access to a public leaderboard with the state-of-the-art performance scores.

The zero-shot assumption is essential to avoid the need for re-training the classifier every time a new product is introduced into stock or an existing product undergoes rebranding. In this paper, we make three key contributions. Firstly, we introduce the MIMEX dataset, comprising 28 distinct product categories. Unlike existing datasets in the literature, MIMEX focuses on fine-grained product classification and includes a diverse range of retail products. Secondly, we benchmark the zero-shot object classification performance of state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the proposed MIMEX dataset. Our experiments reveal that these models achieve unsatisfactory fine-grained classification performance, highlighting the need for specialized approaches. Lastly, we propose a novel ensemble approach that integrates embeddings from CLIP and DINOv2 with dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance classification performance. By combining these components, our ensemble approach outperforms VLMs, effectively capturing visual cues crucial for fine-grained product discrimination. Additionally, we introduce a class adaptation method that utilizes visual prototyping with limited samples in scenarios with scarce labeled data, addressing a critical need in retail environments where product variety frequently changes. To encourage further research into zero-shot object classification for smart retail applications, we will release both the MIMEX dataset and benchmark to the research community.

Leveraging the HM3DSem dataset, HM3D-OVON incorporates over 15k annotated instances of household objects across 379 distinct categories, derived from photo-realistic 3D scans of real-world environments. In contrast to earlier ObjectNav datasets, which limit goal objects to a predefined set of 6-20 categories, HM3D-OVON facilitates the training and evaluation of models with an open-set of goals defined through free-form language at test-time. Through this open-vocabulary formulation, HM3D-OVON encourages progress towards learning visuo-semantic navigation behaviors that are capable of searching for any object specified by text in an open-vocabulary manner. Additionally, we systematically evaluate and compare several different types of approaches on HM3D-OVON. We find that HM3D-OVON can be used to train an open-vocabulary ObjectNav agent that achieves both higher performance and is more robust to localization and actuation noise than the state-of-the-art ObjectNav approach. We hope that our benchmark and baseline results will drive interest in developing embodied agents that can navigate real-world spaces to find household objects specified through free-form language, taking a step towards more flexible and human-like semantic visual navigation.

Few-shot semantic segmentation is one approach that can encourage deep learning models to learn from few labelled examples for novel classes not seen during the training. The generalized few-shot segmentation setting has an additional challenge which encourages models not only to adapt to the novel classes but also to maintain strong performance on the training base classes. While previous datasets and benchmarks discussed the few-shot segmentation setting in remote sensing, we are the first to propose a generalized few-shot segmentation benchmark for remote sensing. The generalized setting is more realistic and challenging, which necessitates exploring it within the remote sensing context. We release the dataset augmenting OpenEarthMap with additional classes labelled for the generalized few-shot evaluation setting. The dataset is released during the OpenEarthMap land cover mapping generalized few-shot challenge in the L3D-IVU workshop in conjunction with CVPR 2024. In this work, we summarize the dataset and challenge details in addition to providing the benchmark results on the two phases of the challenge for the validation and test sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[A Dataset and Benchmark for Shape Completion of Fruits for Agricultural Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13304v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the world population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050, our agricultural production system needs to double its productivity despite a decline of human workforce in the agricultural sector. Autonomous robotic systems are one promising pathway to increase productivity by taking over labor-intensive manual tasks like fruit picking. To be effective, such systems need to monitor and interact with plants and fruits precisely, which is challenging due to the cluttered nature of agricultural environments causing, for example, strong occlusions. Thus, being able to estimate the complete 3D shapes of objects in presence of occlusions is crucial for automating operations such as fruit harvesting. In this paper, we propose the first publicly available 3D shape completion dataset for agricultural vision systems. We provide an RGB-D dataset for estimating the 3D shape of fruits. Specifically, our dataset contains RGB-D frames of single sweet peppers in lab conditions but also in a commercial greenhouse. For each fruit, we additionally collected high-precision point clouds that we use as ground truth. For acquiring the ground truth shape, we developed a measuring process that allows us to record data of real sweet pepper plants, both in the lab and in the greenhouse with high precision, and determine the shape of the sensed fruits. We release our dataset, consisting of almost 7,000 RGB-D frames belonging to more than 100 different fruits. We provide segmented RGB-D frames, with camera intrinsics to easily obtain colored point clouds, together with the corresponding high-precision, occlusion-free point clouds obtained with a high-precision laser scanner. We additionally enable evaluation of shape completion approaches on a hidden test set through a public challenge on a benchmark server.</p></details> |  | None |

This survey leverages a unique taxonomy -- dividing puzzles into rule-based and rule-less categories -- to critically assess LLMs through various methodologies, including prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic approaches, and fine-tuning. Through a critical review of relevant datasets and benchmarks, we assess LLMs' performance, identifying significant challenges in complex puzzle scenarios. Our findings highlight the disparity between LLM capabilities and human-like reasoning, particularly in those requiring advanced logical inference.

| **[TimeLDM: Latent Diffusion Model for Unconditional Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04211v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation is a crucial research topic in the area of decision-making systems, which can be particularly important in domains like autonomous driving, healthcare, and, notably, robotics. Recent approaches focus on learning in the data space to model time series information. However, the data space often contains limited observations and noisy features. In this paper, we propose TimeLDM, a novel latent diffusion model for high-quality time series generation. TimeLDM is composed of a variational autoencoder that encodes time series into an informative and smoothed latent content and a latent diffusion model operating in the latent space to generate latent information. We evaluate the ability of our method to generate synthetic time series with simulated and real-world datasets and benchmark the performance against existing state-of-the-art methods. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed TimeLDM persistently delivers high-quality generated time series. For example, TimeLDM achieves new state-of-the-art results on the simulated benchmarks and an average improvement of 55% in Discriminative score with all benchmarks. Further studies demonstrate that our method yields more robust outcomes across various lengths of time series data generation. Especially, for the Context-FID score and Discriminative score, TimeLDM realizes significant improvements of 80% and 50%, respectively. The code will be released after publication.</p></details> |  | None |

We find a notable deficiency in high-quality content safety datasets and benchmarks that comprehensively cover a wide range of critical safety areas. To address this, we define a broad content safety risk taxonomy, comprising 13 critical risk and 9 sparse risk categories. Additionally, we curate AEGISSAFETYDATASET, a new dataset of approximately 26, 000 human-LLM interaction instances, complete with human annotations adhering to the taxonomy. We plan to release this dataset to the community to further research and to help benchmark LLM models for safety. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we instruction-tune multiple LLM-based safety models. We show that our models (named AEGISSAFETYEXPERTS), not only surpass or perform competitively with the state-of-the-art LLM-based safety models and general purpose LLMs, but also exhibit robustness across multiple jail-break attack categories. We also show how using AEGISSAFETYDATASET during the LLM alignment phase does not negatively impact the performance of the aligned models on MT Bench scores. Furthermore, we propose AEGIS, a novel application of a no-regret online adaptation framework with strong theoretical guarantees, to perform content moderation with an ensemble of LLM content safety experts in deployment</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A System and Benchmark for LLM-based Q&A on Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05735v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions whose answers may be found in structured data sources such as a spreadsheets, databases, APIs, or combinations thereof. Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer. Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs. We find that siwarex does a good job of coping with data source heterogeneity. Our modified Spider benchmark will soon be available to the research community</p></details> |  | None |

However, there is a large variance between the data used in the development and the data collected by the production environment. Therefore, we present the Texture-AD benchmark based on representative texture-based anomaly detection to evaluate the effectiveness of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms in real-world applications. This dataset includes images of 15 different cloth, 14 semiconductor wafers and 10 metal plates acquired under different optical schemes. In addition, it includes more than 10 different types of defects produced during real manufacturing processes, such as scratches, wrinkles, color variations and point defects, which are often more difficult to detect than existing datasets. All anomalous areas are provided with pixel-level annotations to facilitate comprehensive evaluation using anomaly detection models. Specifically, to adapt to diverse products in automated pipelines, we present a new evaluation method and results of baseline algorithms. The experimental results show that Texture-AD is a difficult challenge for state-of-the-art algorithms. To our knowledge, Texture-AD is the first dataset to be devoted to evaluating industrial defect detection algorithms in the real world.

However, many omnidirectional videos have low frame rates that can lead to visual fatigue, and the prevailing plane frame interpolation methodologies are unsuitable for omnidirectional video interpolation because they are designed solely for traditional videos. This paper introduces the benchmark dataset, 360VFI, for Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. We present a practical implementation that introduces a distortion prior from omnidirectional video into the network to modulate distortions. Specifically, we propose a pyramid distortion-sensitive feature extractor that uses the unique characteristics of equirectangular projection (ERP) format as prior information. Moreover, we devise a decoder that uses an affine transformation to further facilitate the synthesis of intermediate frames. 360VFI is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. Through our benchmark analysis, we present four different distortion condition scenes in the proposed 360VFI dataset to evaluate the challenges triggered by distortion during interpolation. Besides, experimental results demonstrate that Omnidirectional Video Interpolation can be effectively improved by modeling for omnidirectional distortion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces PointLLM, a preliminary effort to fill this gap, enabling LLMs to understand point clouds and offering a new avenue beyond 2D visual data. PointLLM understands colored object point clouds with human instructions and generates contextually appropriate responses, illustrating its grasp of point clouds and common sense. Specifically, it leverages a point cloud encoder with a powerful LLM to effectively fuse geometric, appearance, and linguistic information. We collect a novel dataset comprising 660K simple and 70K complex point-text instruction pairs to enable a two-stage training strategy: aligning latent spaces and subsequently instruction-tuning the unified model. To rigorously evaluate the perceptual and generalization capabilities of PointLLM, we establish two benchmarks: Generative 3D Object Classification and 3D Object Captioning, assessed through three different methods, including human evaluation, GPT-4/ChatGPT evaluation, and traditional metrics. Experimental results reveal PointLLM's superior performance over existing 2D and 3D baselines, with a notable achievement in human-evaluated object captioning tasks where it surpasses human annotators in over 50% of the samples.

We introduce a novel natural experiment dataset obtained from an early childhood literacy nonprofit. Surprisingly, applying over 20 established estimators to the dataset produces inconsistent results in evaluating the nonprofit's efficacy. To address this, we create a benchmark to evaluate estimator accuracy using synthetic outcomes, whose design was guided by domain experts. The benchmark extensively explores performance as real world conditions like sample size, treatment correlation, and propensity score accuracy vary. Based on our benchmark, we observe that the class of doubly robust treatment effect estimators, which are based on simple and intuitive regression adjustment, generally outperform other more complicated estimators by orders of magnitude. To better support our theoretical understanding of doubly robust estimators, we derive a closed form expression for the variance of any such estimator that uses dataset splitting to obtain an unbiased estimate. This expression motivates the design of a new doubly robust estimator that uses a novel loss function when fitting functions for regression adjustment. We release the dataset and benchmark in a Python package; the package is built in a modular way to facilitate new datasets and estimators.</p></details> |  | None |

The role of taillights in conveying these intentions is underemphasized in current autonomous driving systems. Accurately identifying taillight signals is essential for predicting vehicle behavior and preventing collisions. Open-source taillight datasets are scarce, often small and inconsistently annotated. To address this gap, we introduce a new large-scale taillight dataset called TLD. Sourced globally, our dataset covers diverse traffic scenarios. To our knowledge, TLD is the first dataset to separately annotate brake lights and turn signals in real driving scenarios. We collected 17.78 hours of driving videos from the internet. This dataset consists of 152k labeled image frames sampled at a rate of 2 Hz, along with 1.5 million unlabeled frames interspersed throughout. Additionally, we have developed a two-stage vehicle light detection model consisting of two primary modules: a vehicle detector and a taillight classifier. Initially, YOLOv10 and DeepSORT captured consecutive vehicle images over time. Subsequently, the two classifiers work simultaneously to determine the states of the brake lights and turn signals. A post-processing procedure is then used to eliminate noise caused by misidentifications and provide the taillight states of the vehicle within a given time frame. Our method shows exceptional performance on our dataset, establishing a benchmark for vehicle taillight detection.

Benchmark datasets enable the widespread development of state-of-the-art machine learning methods, which require large datasets for training, validation, and thorough comparison to competing approaches. Underwater environments impose several operational challenges that hinder efforts to collect large benchmark datasets for marine robot perception. Furthermore, a low abundance of targets of interest relative to the size of the search space leads to increased time and cost required to collect useful datasets for a specific task. As a result, there is limited availability of labeled benchmark datasets for underwater applications. We present the AI4Shipwrecks dataset, which consists of 28 distinct shipwrecks totaling 286 high-resolution labeled side scan sonar images to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous sonar image understanding. We leverage the unique abundance of targets in Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in Lake Huron, MI, to collect and compile a sonar imagery benchmark dataset through surveys with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We consulted with expert marine archaeologists for the labeling of robotically gathered data. We then leverage this dataset to perform benchmark experiments for comparison of state-of-the-art supervised segmentation methods, and we present insights on opportunities and open challenges for the field.

Most previous methods primarily experiment with the NYUv2 Dataset and concentrate on the overall performance in their evaluation. However, their robustness and generalization to diversely unseen types or categories for indoor spaces (spaces types) have yet to be discovered. Researchers may empirically find degraded performance in a released pretrained model on custom data or less-frequent types. This paper studies the common but easily overlooked factor-space type and realizes a model's performance variances across spaces. We present InSpaceType Dataset, a high-quality RGBD dataset for general indoor scenes, and benchmark 13 recent state-of-the-art methods on InSpaceType. Our examination shows that most of them suffer from performance imbalance between head and tailed types, and some top methods are even more severe. The work reveals and analyzes underlying bias in detail for transparency and robustness. We extend the analysis to a total of 4 datasets and discuss the best practice in synthetic data curation for training indoor monocular depth. Further, dataset ablation is conducted to find out the key factor in generalization. This work marks the first in-depth investigation of performance variances across space types and, more importantly, releases useful tools, including datasets and codes, to closely examine your pretrained depth models.

Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the advancements in human face identification, the lack of datasets and benchmarks in the animal domain has impeded progress. In this paper, we introduce the PetFace dataset, a comprehensive resource for animal face identification encompassing 257,484 unique individuals across 13 animal families and 319 breed categories, including both experimental and pet animals. This large-scale collection of individuals facilitates the investigation of unseen animal face verification, an area that has not been sufficiently explored in existing datasets due to the limited number of individuals. Moreover, PetFace also has fine-grained annotations such as sex, breed, color, and pattern. We provide multiple benchmarks including re-identification for seen individuals and verification for unseen individuals. The models trained on our dataset outperform those trained on prior datasets, even for detailed breed variations and unseen animal families. Our result also indicates that there is some room to improve the performance of integrated identification on multiple animal families. We hope the PetFace dataset will facilitate animal face identification and encourage the development of non-invasive animal automatic identification methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

Currently, the usage of a single RSU mainly focuses on real-time inference and V2X collaboration, while neglecting the potential value of the high-quality data collected by RSU sensors. Integrating the vast amounts of data from numerous RSUs can provide a rich source of data for model training. However, the absence of ground truth annotations and the difficulty of transmitting enormous volumes of data are two inevitable barriers to fully exploiting this hidden value. In this paper, we introduce FedRSU, an innovative federated learning framework for self-supervised scene flow estimation. In FedRSU, we present a recurrent self-supervision training paradigm, where for each RSU, the scene flow prediction of points at every timestamp can be supervised by its subsequent future multi-modality observation. Another key component of FedRSU is federated learning, where multiple devices collaboratively train an ML model while keeping the training data local and private. With the power of the recurrent self-supervised learning paradigm, FL is able to leverage innumerable underutilized data from RSU. To verify the FedRSU framework, we construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset RSU-SF. The dataset consists of 17 RSU clients, covering various scenarios, modalities, and sensor settings. Based on RSU-SF, we show that FedRSU can greatly improve model performance in ITS and provide a comprehensive benchmark under diverse FL scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first real-world LiDAR-camera multi-modal dataset and benchmark for the FL community.</p></details> |  | None |

Furthermore, we develop a training methodology that emphasizes entity-centric image-text generation, ensuring that the models learn to effectively interweave visual and textual information. Specifically, Openstory++ streamlines the process of keyframe extraction from open-domain videos, employing vision-language models to generate captions that are then polished by a large language model for narrative continuity. It surpasses previous datasets by offering a more expansive open-domain resource, which incorporates automated captioning, high-resolution imagery tailored for instance count, and extensive frame sequences for temporal consistency. Additionally, we present Cohere-Bench, a pioneering benchmark framework for evaluating the image generation tasks when long multimodal context is provided, including the ability to keep the background, style, instances in the given context coherent. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work fills critical gaps in multi-modal generation, propelling the development of models that can adeptly generate and interpret complex narratives in open-domain environments. Experiments conducted within Cohere-Bench confirm the superiority of Openstory++ in nurturing high-quality visual storytelling models, enhancing their ability to address open-domain generation tasks.

However, developing such models specifically for the Russian language has received little attention. This paper introduces a collection of 13 Russian Transformer LMs, which spans encoder (ruBERT, ruRoBERTa, ruELECTRA), decoder (ruGPT-3), and encoder-decoder (ruT5, FRED-T5) architectures. We provide a report on the model architecture design and pretraining, and the results of evaluating their generalization abilities on Russian language understanding and generation datasets and benchmarks. By pretraining and releasing these specialized Transformer LMs, we aim to broaden the scope of the NLP research directions and enable the development of industrial solutions for the Russian language.</p></details> | LREC-COLING-2024 | None |
| **[InScope: A New Real-world 3D Infrastructure-side Collaborative Perception Dataset for Open Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21581v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception systems of autonomous vehicles are susceptible to occlusion, especially when examined from a vehicle-centric perspective. Such occlusion can lead to overlooked object detections, e.g., larger vehicles such as trucks or buses may create blind spots where cyclists or pedestrians could be obscured, accentuating the safety concerns associated with such perception system limitations. To mitigate these challenges, the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) paradigm suggests employing an infrastructure-side perception system (IPS) to complement autonomous vehicles with a broader perceptual scope. Nevertheless, the scarcity of real-world 3D infrastructure-side datasets constrains the advancement of V2X technologies. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces a new 3D infrastructure-side collaborative perception dataset, abbreviated as inscope. Notably, InScope is the first dataset dedicated to addressing occlusion challenges by strategically deploying multiple-position Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems on the infrastructure side. Specifically, InScope encapsulates a 20-day capture duration with 303 tracking trajectories and 187,787 3D bounding boxes annotated by experts. Through analysis of benchmarks, four different benchmarks are presented for open traffic scenarios, including collaborative 3D object detection, multisource data fusion, data domain transfer, and 3D multiobject tracking tasks. Additionally, a new metric is designed to quantify the impact of occlusion, facilitating the evaluation of detection degradation ratios among various algorithms. The Experimental findings showcase the enhanced performance of leveraging InScope to assist in detecting and tracking 3D multiobjects in real-world scenarios, particularly in tracking obscured, small, and distant objects.

The Hilti SLAM Challenges organized over the past years have been successful at benchmarking some of the world's best SLAM Systems with high accuracy. However, more capabilities of these systems are yet to be explored, such as platform agnosticism across varying sensor suites and multi-session SLAM. These factors indirectly serve as an indicator of robustness and ease of deployment in real-world applications. There exists no dataset plus benchmark combination publicly available, which considers these factors combined. The Hilti SLAM Challenge 2023 Dataset and Benchmark addresses this issue. Additionally, we propose a novel fiducial marker design for a pre-surveyed point on the ground to be observable from an off-the-shelf LiDAR mounted on a robot, and an algorithm to estimate its position at mm-level accuracy. Results from the challenge show an increase in overall participation, single-session SLAM systems getting increasingly accurate, successfully operating across varying sensor suites, but relatively few participants performing multi-session SLAM.

One significant challenge in enhancing such content using deep learning is the scarcity of training data. This paper introduces a novel low-light video dataset, consisting of 40 scenes with various motion scenarios under two distinct low-lighting conditions, incorporating genuine noise and temporal artifacts. We provide fully registered ground truth data captured in normal light using a programmable motorized dolly and refine it via an image-based approach for pixel-wise frame alignment across different light levels. We provide benchmarks based on four different technologies: convolutional neural networks, transformers, diffusion models, and state space models (mamba). Our experimental results demonstrate the significance of fully registered video pairs for low-light video enhancement (LLVE) and the comprehensive evaluation shows that the models trained with our dataset outperform those trained with the existing datasets.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at learning molecular representations from a 2D molecular graph or a single 3D structure, existing works often overlook the flexible nature of molecules, which continuously interconvert across conformations via chemical bond rotations and minor vibrational perturbations. To better account for molecular flexibility, some recent works formulate MRL as an ensemble learning problem, focusing on explicitly learning from a set of conformer structures. However, most of these studies have limited datasets, tasks, and models. In this work, we introduce the first MoleculAR Conformer Ensemble Learning (MARCEL) benchmark to thoroughly evaluate the potential of learning on conformer ensembles and suggest promising research directions. MARCEL includes four datasets covering diverse molecule- and reaction-level properties of chemically diverse molecules including organocatalysts and transition-metal catalysts, extending beyond the scope of common GNN benchmarks that are confined to drug-like molecules. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study, which benchmarks representative 1D, 2D, and 3D molecular representation learning models, along with two strategies that explicitly incorporate conformer ensembles into 3D MRL models. Our findings reveal that direct learning from an accessible conformer space can improve performance on a variety of tasks and models.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 | None |
| **[XS-VID: An Extremely Small Video Object Detection Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18137v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small Video Object Detection (SVOD) is a crucial subfield in modern computer vision, essential for early object discovery and detection. However, existing SVOD datasets are scarce and suffer from issues such as insufficiently small objects, limited object categories, and lack of scene diversity, leading to unitary application scenarios for corresponding methods. To address this gap, we develop the XS-VID dataset, which comprises aerial data from various periods and scenes, and annotates eight major object categories. To further evaluate existing methods for detecting extremely small objects, XS-VID extensively collects three types of objects with smaller pixel areas: extremely small (\textit{es}, $0\sim12^2$), relatively small (\textit{rs}, $12^2\sim20^2$), and generally small (\textit{gs}, $20^2\sim32^2$). XS-VID offers unprecedented breadth and depth in covering and quantifying minuscule objects, significantly enriching the scene and object diversity in the dataset. Extensive validations on XS-VID and the publicly available VisDrone2019VID dataset show that existing methods struggle with small object detection and significantly underperform compared to general object detectors. Leveraging the strengths of previous methods and addressing their weaknesses, we propose YOLOFT, which enhances local feature associations and integrates temporal motion features, significantly improving the accuracy and stability of SVOD.

However, current preference optimization approaches often fail to capture the plurality of user opinions, instead reinforcing majority viewpoints and marginalizing minority perspectives. We introduce PERSONA, a reproducible test bed designed to evaluate and improve pluralistic alignment of LMs. We procedurally generate diverse user profiles from US census data, resulting in 1,586 synthetic personas with varied demographic and idiosyncratic attributes. We then generate a large-scale evaluation dataset containing 3,868 prompts and 317,200 feedback pairs obtained from our synthetic personas. Leveraging this dataset, we systematically evaluate LM capabilities in role-playing diverse users, verified through human judges, and the establishment of both a benchmark, PERSONA Bench, for pluralistic alignment approaches as well as an extensive dataset to create new and future benchmarks.

Vision systems can support making better and more sustainable field management decisions, but also support the breeding of new crop varieties by allowing temporally dense and reproducible measurements. Recently, agricultural robotics got an increasing interest in the vision and robotics communities since it is a promising avenue for coping with the aforementioned lack of workers and enabling more sustainable production. While large datasets and benchmarks in other domains are readily available and enable significant progress, agricultural datasets and benchmarks are comparably rare. We present an annotated dataset and benchmarks for the semantic interpretation of real agricultural fields. Our dataset recorded with a UAV provides high-quality, pixel-wise annotations of crops and weeds, but also crop leaf instances at the same time. Furthermore, we provide benchmarks for various tasks on a hidden test set comprised of different fields: known fields covered by the training data and a completely unseen field.

Designers must review state-of-the-art topology configurations in the literature and sweep various circuit parameters within each configuration. This design process is highly specialized and time-intensive, particularly as the number of circuit parameters increases and the circuit becomes more complex. Prior research has explored the potential of machine learning to enhance circuit design procedures. However, these studies primarily focus on simple circuits, overlooking the more practical and complex analog and radio-frequency systems. A major obstacle for bearing the power of machine learning in circuit design is the availability of a generic and diverse dataset, along with robust metrics, which are essential for thoroughly evaluating and improving machine learning algorithms in the analog and radio-frequency circuit domain. We present AICircuit, a comprehensive multi-level dataset and benchmark for developing and evaluating ML algorithms in analog and radio-frequency circuit design. AICircuit comprises seven commonly used basic circuits and two complex wireless transceiver systems composed of multiple circuit blocks, encompassing a wide array of design scenarios encountered in real-world applications. We extensively evaluate various ML algorithms on the dataset, revealing the potential of ML algorithms in learning the mapping from the design specifications to the desired circuit parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

Text conditioned floorplan generation as a special type of raster image generation task also received particular attention. However there are many use cases in floorpla generation where numerical properties of the generated result are more important than the aesthetics. For instance, one might want to specify sizes for certain rooms in a floorplan and compare the generated floorplan with given specifications Current approaches, datasets and commonly used evaluations do not support these kinds of constraints. As such, an attractive strategy is to generate an intermediate data structure that contains numerical properties of a floorplan which can be used to generate the final floorplan image. To explore this setting we (1) construct a new dataset for this data-structure to data-structure formulation of floorplan generation using two popular image based floorplan datasets RPLAN and ProcTHOR-10k, and provide the tools to convert further procedurally generated ProcTHOR floorplan data into our format. (2) We explore the task of floorplan generation given a partial or complete set of constraints and we design a series of metrics and benchmarks to enable evaluating how well samples generated from models respect the constraints. (3) We create multiple baselines by finetuning a large language model (LLM), Llama3, and demonstrate the feasibility of using floorplan data structure conditioned LLMs for the problem of floorplan generation respecting numerical constraints. We hope that our new datasets and benchmarks will encourage further research on different ways to improve the performance of LLMs and other generative modelling techniques for generating designs where quantitative constraints are only partially specified, but must be respected.</p></details> |  | None |

Furthermore, such datasets typically include relatively few hand-coded test cases over which LLM accuracy is determined, thus making them inadequate for determining the safety or correctness of their generated outputs. We introduce a new approach that utilizes context-free grammars (CFGs) to generate out-of-distribution datasets on the fly and perform closed-loop testing of LLM capabilities using formal verifiers to guarantee the correctness of LLM outputs without any human intervention. We release our dataset and benchmark as open-source code at \url{https://github.com/AAIR-lab/auto-llm-assessment}. We also conduct an assessment of several SOTA closed and open-source LLMs to showcase the feasibility and scalability of this paradigm. Our experiments reveal that SOTA LLMs are unable to solve the formal translation task adequately.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/AAIR-lab/auto-llm-assessment) |

Even today, almost all productive work done on the computer necessitates human input at every step. Autonomous virtual agents represent an exciting step in automating many of these menial tasks. Virtual agents would empower users with limited technical proficiency to harness the full possibilities of computer systems. They could also enable the efficient streamlining of numerous computer tasks, ranging from calendar management to complex travel bookings, with minimal human intervention. In this paper, we introduce OmniACT, the first-of-a-kind dataset and benchmark for assessing an agent's capability to generate executable programs to accomplish computer tasks. Our scope extends beyond traditional web automation, covering a diverse range of desktop applications. The dataset consists of fundamental tasks such as "Play the next song", as well as longer horizon tasks such as "Send an email to John Doe mentioning the time and place to meet". Specifically, given a pair of screen image and a visually-grounded natural language task, the goal is to generate a script capable of fully executing the task. We run several strong baseline language model agents on our benchmark. The strongest baseline, GPT-4, performs the best on our benchmark However, its performance level still reaches only 15% of the human proficiency in generating executable scripts capable of completing the task, demonstrating the challenge of our task for conventional web agents. Our benchmark provides a platform to measure and evaluate the progress of language model agents in automating computer tasks and motivates future work towards building multimodal models that bridge large language models and the visual grounding of computer screens.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Benchmark Dataset for Multimodal Prediction of Enzymatic Function Coupling DNA Sequences and Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15888v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting gene function from its DNA sequence is a fundamental challenge in biology. Many deep learning models have been proposed to embed DNA sequences and predict their enzymatic function, leveraging information in public databases linking DNA sequences to an enzymatic function label. However, much of the scientific community's knowledge of biological function is not represented in these categorical labels, and is instead captured in unstructured text descriptions of mechanisms, reactions, and enzyme behavior. These descriptions are often captured alongside DNA sequences in biological databases, albeit in an unstructured manner. Deep learning of models predicting enzymatic function are likely to benefit from incorporating this multi-modal data encoding scientific knowledge of biological function. There is, however, no dataset designed for machine learning algorithms to leverage this multi-modal information. Here we propose a novel dataset and benchmark suite that enables the exploration and development of large multi-modal neural network models on gene DNA sequences and natural language descriptions of gene function. We present baseline performance on benchmarks for both unsupervised and supervised tasks that demonstrate the difficulty of this modeling objective, while demonstrating the potential benefit of incorporating multi-modal data types in function prediction compared to DNA sequences alone.

In this paper, we scale up indoor radar data collection using multi-view high-resolution radar heatmap in a multi-day, multi-room, and multi-subject setting, with an emphasis on the diversity of environment and subjects. Referred to as the millimeter-wave multi-view radar (MMVR) dataset, it consists of $345$K multi-view radar frames collected from $25$ human subjects over $6$ different rooms, $446$K annotated bounding boxes/segmentation instances, and $7.59$ million annotated keypoints to support three major perception tasks of object detection, pose estimation, and instance segmentation, respectively. For each task, we report performance benchmarks under two protocols: a single subject in an open space and multiple subjects in several cluttered rooms with two data splits: random split and cross-environment split over $395$ 1-min data segments.

However, traditional approaches primarily deploy models to discriminate among discrete emotion categories, and lack the fine granularity and reasoning capability for complex facial behaviors. The advent of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has been proven successful in general visual understanding tasks. However, directly harnessing MLLMs for FABA is challenging due to the scarcity of datasets and benchmarks, neglecting facial prior knowledge, and low training efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce (i) an instruction-following dataset for two FABA tasks, e.g., emotion and action unit recognition, (ii) a benchmark FABA-Bench with a new metric considering both recognition and generation ability, and (iii) a new MLLM "EmoLA" as a strong baseline to the community. Our initiative on the dataset and benchmarks reveal the nature and rationale of facial affective behaviors, i.e., fine-grained facial movement, interpretability, and reasoning. Moreover, to build an effective and efficient FABA MLLM, we introduce a facial prior expert module with face structure knowledge and a low-rank adaptation module into pre-trained MLLM. We conduct extensive experiments on FABA-Bench and four commonly-used FABA datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed facial prior expert can boost the performance and EmoLA achieves the best results on our FABA-Bench.

Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans and text-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefit from these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, state of the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation across several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate the performance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer and Q-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision models across many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities. Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate with confident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on these findings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for report generation using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase grounding tools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologies localised and described based on their likelihood. We thoroughly evaluate our vision-language agents using NLP metrics, chest X-ray benchmarks and clinical evaluations by developing an evaluation platform to perform a user study with respiratory specialists. Our results show considerable improvements in accuracy, interpretability and safety of the AI-generated reports.

Evaluating LLMs at Temporal Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08460v2)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the urgent need for evolving evaluation methodologies that keep pace with improvements in language comprehension and information processing. However, traditional benchmarks, which are often static, fail to capture the continually changing information landscape, leading to a disparity between the perceived and actual effectiveness of LLMs in ever-changing real-world scenarios. Our study examines temporal generalization, which includes the ability to understand, predict, and generate text relevant to past, present, and future contexts, revealing significant temporal biases in LLMs. We propose an evaluation framework, for dynamically generating benchmarks from recent real-world predictions. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle with temporal generalization, showing performance decline over time. These findings highlight the necessity for improved training and updating processes to enhance adaptability and reduce biases.

The surge of generative AI facilitates designing city layouts based on deep learning models. However, the lack of high-quality datasets and benchmarks hinders the progress of these data-driven methods in generating road networks and building layouts. Furthermore, few studies consider urban characteristics, which generally take graphics as analysis objects and are crucial for practical applications, to control the generative process. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a multimodal dataset with accompanying evaluation metrics for controllable generation of Road networks and Building layouts (RoBus), which is the first and largest open-source dataset in city generation so far. RoBus dataset is formatted as images, graphics and texts, with $72,400$ paired samples that cover around $80,000km^2$ globally. We analyze the RoBus dataset statistically and validate the effectiveness against existing road networks and building layouts generation methods. Additionally, we design new baselines that incorporate urban characteristics, such as road orientation and building density, in the process of generating road networks and building layouts using the RoBus dataset, enhancing the practicality of automated urban design.

| **[A Fine-tuning Dataset and Benchmark for Large Language Models for Protein Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05540v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The parallels between protein sequences and natural language in their sequential structures have inspired the application of large language models (LLMs) to protein understanding. Despite the success of LLMs in NLP, their effectiveness in comprehending protein sequences remains an open question, largely due to the absence of datasets linking protein sequences to descriptive text. Researchers have then attempted to adapt LLMs for protein understanding by integrating a protein sequence encoder with a pre-trained LLM. However, this adaptation raises a fundamental question: "Can LLMs, originally designed for NLP, effectively comprehend protein sequences as a form of language?" Current datasets fall short in addressing this question due to the lack of a direct correlation between protein sequences and corresponding text descriptions, limiting the ability to train and evaluate LLMs for protein understanding effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProteinLMDataset, a dataset specifically designed for further self-supervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs to enhance their capability for protein sequence comprehension. Specifically, ProteinLMDataset includes 17.46 billion tokens for pretraining and 893,000 instructions for SFT. Additionally, we present ProteinLMBench, the first benchmark dataset consisting of 944 manually verified multiple-choice questions for assessing the protein understanding capabilities of LLMs. ProteinLMBench incorporates protein-related details and sequences in multiple languages, establishing a new standard for evaluating LLMs' abilities in protein comprehension. The large language model InternLM2-7B, pretrained and fine-tuned on the ProteinLMDataset, outperforms GPT-4 on ProteinLMBench, achieving the highest accuracy score.</p></details> |  | None |

While various deep learning models have been built for these tasks, each is specific to a particular problem, with few standard benchmarks available. We propose a new dataset pairing satellite imagery and high-quality survey data on child poverty to benchmark satellite feature representations. Our dataset consists of 33,608 images, each 10 km $\times$ 10 km, from 19 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa in the time period 1997-2022. As defined by UNICEF, multidimensional child poverty covers six dimensions and it can be calculated from the face-to-face Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program . As part of the benchmark, we test spatial as well as temporal generalization, by testing on unseen locations, and on data after the training years. Using our dataset we benchmark multiple models, from low-level satellite imagery models such as MOSAIKS , to deep learning foundation models, which include both generic vision models such as Self-Distillation with no Labels (DINOv2) models and specific satellite imagery models such as SatMAE. We provide open source code for building the satellite dataset, obtaining ground truth data from DHS and running various models assessed in our work.</p></details> | 15 pages, 1 figure | None |
| **[Towards Enhancing Coherence in Extractive Summarization: Dataset and Experiments with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04855v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extractive summarization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing due to its wide-range applications in summarizing diverse content efficiently, while also being faithful to the original content. Despite significant advancement achieved in extractive summarization by Large Language Models (LLMs), these summaries frequently exhibit incoherence. An important aspect of the coherent summary is its readability for intended users. Although there have been many datasets and benchmarks proposed for creating coherent extractive summaries, none of them currently incorporate user intent to improve coherence in extractive summarization. Motivated by this, we propose a systematically created human-annotated dataset consisting of coherent summaries for five publicly available datasets and natural language user feedback, offering valuable insights into how to improve coherence in extractive summaries. We utilize this dataset for aligning LLMs through supervised fine-tuning with natural language human feedback to enhance the coherence of their generated summaries. Preliminary experiments with Falcon-40B and Llama-2-13B show significant performance improvements (~10% Rouge-L) in terms of producing coherent summaries. We further utilize human feedback to benchmark results over instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 which resulted in several interesting findings.

While there has been an exponentially growing number of research regarding digital communication, the majority of existing communication technologies primarily cater to spoken or written languages, instead of SL, the essential communication method for Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Existing SL datasets, dictionaries, and sign language production (SLP) methods are typically limited to 2D as annotating 3D models and avatars for SL is usually an entirely manual and labor-intensive process conducted by SL experts, often resulting in unnatural avatars. In response to these challenges, we compile and curate the SignAvatars dataset, which comprises 70,000 videos from 153 signers, totaling 8.34 million frames, covering both isolated signs and continuous, co-articulated signs, with multiple prompts including HamNoSys, spoken language, and words. To yield 3D holistic annotations, including meshes and biomechanically-valid poses of body, hands, and face, as well as 2D and 3D keypoints, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline operating on our large corpus of SL videos. SignAvatars facilitates various tasks such as 3D sign language recognition (SLR) and the novel 3D SL production (SLP) from diverse inputs like text scripts, individual words, and HamNoSys notation. Hence, to evaluate the potential of SignAvatars, we further propose a unified benchmark of 3D SL holistic motion production. We believe that this work is a significant step forward towards bringing the digital world to the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities as well as people interacting with them.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024 14 pages; Project page available at https://signavatars.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Massive Multilingual Holistic Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00486v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current landscape of automatic language generation, there is a need to understand, evaluate, and mitigate demographic biases as existing models are becoming increasingly multilingual. To address this, we present the initial eight languages from the MASSIVE MULTILINGUAL HOLISTICBIAS (MMHB) dataset and benchmark consisting of approximately 6 million sentences representing 13 demographic axes. We propose an automatic construction methodology to further scale up MMHB sentences in terms of both language coverage and size, leveraging limited human annotation. Our approach utilizes placeholders in multilingual sentence construction and employs a systematic method to independently translate sentence patterns, nouns, and descriptors. Combined with human translation, this technique carefully designs placeholders to dynamically generate multiple sentence variations and significantly reduces the human translation workload. The translation process has been meticulously conducted to avoid an English-centric perspective and include all necessary morphological variations for languages that require them, improving from the original English HOLISTICBIAS. Finally, we utilize MMHB to report results on gender bias and added toxicity in machine translation tasks. On the gender analysis, MMHB unveils: (1) a lack of gender robustness showing almost +4 chrf points in average for masculine semantic sentences compared to feminine ones and (2) a preference to overgeneralize to masculine forms by reporting more than +12 chrf points in average when evaluating with masculine compared to feminine references. MMHB triggers added toxicity up to 2.3%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[XLD: A Cross-Lane Dataset for Benchmarking Novel Driving View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18360v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thoroughly testing autonomy systems is crucial in the pursuit of safe autonomous driving vehicles. It necessitates creating safety-critical scenarios that go beyond what can be safely collected from real-world data, as many of these scenarios occur infrequently on public roads. However, the evaluation of most existing NVS methods relies on sporadic sampling of image frames from the training data, comparing the rendered images with ground truth images using metrics. Unfortunately, this evaluation protocol falls short of meeting the actual requirements in closed-loop simulations. Specifically, the true application demands the capability to render novel views that extend beyond the original trajectory (such as cross-lane views), which are challenging to capture in the real world. To address this, this paper presents a novel driving view synthesis dataset and benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving simulations. This dataset is unique as it includes testing images captured by deviating from the training trajectory by 1-4 meters. It comprises six sequences encompassing various time and weather conditions. Each sequence contains 450 training images, 150 testing images, and their corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters. Leveraging this novel dataset, we establish the first realistic benchmark for evaluating existing NVS approaches under front-only and multi-camera settings. The experimental findings underscore the significant gap that exists in current approaches, revealing their inadequate ability to fulfill the demanding prerequisites of cross-lane or closed-loop simulation.

However, due to a lack of professional medical knowledge, patients are easily misled by generated erroneous information from LLMs, which may result in serious medical problems. To address this issue, we focus on tuning the LLMs to be medical assistants who collaborate with more experienced doctors. We first conduct a two-stage survey by inspiration-feedback to gain a broad understanding of the real needs of doctors for medical assistants. Based on this, we construct a Chinese medical dataset called DoctorFLAN to support the entire workflow of doctors, which includes 92K Q\&A samples from 22 tasks and 27 specialists. Moreover, we evaluate LLMs in doctor-oriented scenarios by constructing the DoctorFLAN-\textit{test} containing 550 single-turn Q\&A and DotaBench containing 74 multi-turn conversations. The evaluation results indicate that being a medical assistant still poses challenges for existing open-source models, but DoctorFLAN can help them significantly. It demonstrates that the doctor-oriented dataset and benchmarks we construct can complement existing patient-oriented work and better promote medical LLMs research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing graph learning benchmarks often overlook the rich semantic information associate with each node. To bridge such gap, we introduce the Multimodal Graph Benchmark (MM-GRAPH), the first comprehensive multi-modal graph benchmark that incorporates both textual and visual information. MM-GRAPH surpasses previous efforts, which have primarily focused on text-attributed graphs with various connectivity patterns. MM-GRAPH consists of five graph learning datasets of various scales that are appropriate for different learning tasks. Their multimodal node features, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of graph learning algorithms in real-world scenarios. To facilitate research on multimodal graph learning, we further provide an extensive study on the performance of various graph neural networks in the presence of features from various modalities. MM-GRAPH aims to foster research on multimodal graph learning and drive the development of more advanced and robust graph learning algorithms. By providing a diverse set of datasets and benchmarks, MM-GRAPH enables researchers to evaluate and compare their models in realistic settings, ultimately leading to improved performance on real-world applications that rely on multimodal graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://mm-graph-benchmark.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, recent progress in text-to-image generation has introduced formidable challenges to copyright enforcement. These technologies enable the unauthorized learning and replication of copyrighted content, artistic creations, and likenesses, leading to the proliferation of unregulated content. Notably, models like stable diffusion, which excel in text-to-image synthesis, heighten the risk of copyright infringement and unauthorized distribution.Machine unlearning, which seeks to eradicate the influence of specific data or concepts from machine learning models, emerges as a promising solution by eliminating the \enquote{copyright memories} ingrained in diffusion models. Yet, the absence of comprehensive large-scale datasets and standardized benchmarks for evaluating the efficacy of unlearning techniques in the copyright protection scenarios impedes the development of more effective unlearning methods. To address this gap, we introduce a novel pipeline that harmonizes CLIP, ChatGPT, and diffusion models to curate a dataset. This dataset encompasses anchor images, associated prompts, and images synthesized by text-to-image models. Additionally, we have developed a mixed metric based on semantic and style information, validated through both human and artist assessments, to gauge the effectiveness of unlearning approaches.

The primary strategy for this evaluation relies on assumed differences between source domain samples and target domain samples in benchmark datasets. This evaluation strategy fails to account for the similarity between source and target domains, and may mask when models fail to transfer learning to specific target samples which are highly dissimilar from the source domain. We introduce Depth $F_1$, a novel cross-domain text classification performance metric. Designed to be complementary to existing classification metrics such as $F_1$, Depth $F_1$ measures how well a model performs on target samples which are dissimilar from the source domain. We motivate this metric using standard cross-domain text classification datasets and benchmark several recent cross-domain text classification models, with the goal of enabling in-depth evaluation of the semantic generalizability of cross-domain text classification models.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces HumorDB, a novel image-only dataset specifically designed to advance visual humor understanding. HumorDB consists of meticulously curated image pairs with contrasting humor ratings, emphasizing subtle visual cues that trigger humor and mitigating potential biases. The dataset enables evaluation through binary classification(Funny or Not Funny), range regression(funniness on a scale from 1 to 10), and pairwise comparison tasks(Which Image is Funnier?), effectively capturing the subjective nature of humor perception. Initial experiments reveal that while vision-only models struggle, vision-language models, particularly those leveraging large language models, show promising results. HumorDB also shows potential as a valuable zero-shot benchmark for powerful large multimodal models.

Applying 'explainable artificial intelligence' (XAI) techniques to enrich such models' outputs is considered crucial for assuring their quality and shedding light on their inner workings. However, large language models are trained on a plethora of data containing a variety of biases, such as gender biases, affecting model weights and, potentially, behavior. Currently, it is unclear to what extent such biases also impact model explanations in possibly unfavorable ways. We create a gender-controlled text dataset, GECO, in which otherwise identical sentences appear in male and female forms. This gives rise to ground-truth 'world explanations' for gender classification tasks, enabling the objective evaluation of the correctness of XAI methods. We also provide GECOBench, a rigorous quantitative evaluation framework benchmarking popular XAI methods, applying them to pre-trained language models fine-tuned to different degrees. This allows us to investigate how pre-training induces undesirable bias in model explanations and to what extent fine-tuning can mitigate such explanation bias. We show a clear dependency between explanation performance and the number of fine-tuned layers, where XAI methods are observed to particularly benefit from fine-tuning or complete retraining of embedding layers. Remarkably, this relationship holds for models achieving similar classification performance on the same task. With that, we highlight the utility of the proposed gender-controlled dataset and novel benchmarking approach for research and development of novel XAI methods.

ComperDial consists of human-scored responses for 10,395 dialogue turns in 1,485 conversations collected from 99 dialogue agents submitted to the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue (CPD) challenge. As a result, for any dialogue, our benchmark includes multiple diverse responses with variety of characteristics to ensure more robust evaluation of learned dialogue metrics. In addition to single-turn response scores, ComperDial also contains dialogue-level human-annotated scores, enabling joint assessment of multi-turn model responses throughout a dialogue. Finally, building off ComperDial, we devise a new automatic evaluation metric to measure the general similarity of model-generated dialogues to human conversations. Our experimental results demonstrate that our novel metric, CPDScore is more correlated with human judgments than existing metrics. We release both ComperDial and CPDScore to the community to accelerate development of automatic evaluation metrics for open-domain dialogue systems.</p></details> |  | None |

This work presents WaterScenes, the first multi-task 4D radar-camera fusion dataset for autonomous driving on water surfaces. Equipped with a 4D radar and a monocular camera, our Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) proffers all-weather solutions for discerning object-related information, including color, shape, texture, range, velocity, azimuth, and elevation. Focusing on typical static and dynamic objects on water surfaces, we label the camera images and radar point clouds at pixel-level and point-level, respectively. In addition to basic perception tasks, such as object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, we also provide annotations for free-space segmentation and waterline segmentation. Leveraging the multi-task and multi-modal data, we conduct benchmark experiments on the uni-modality of radar and camera, as well as the fused modalities.

However, limited by existing datasets, previous works mainly focus on understanding object properties or inter-object spatial relationships in a 3D scene. To tackle this problem, this paper builds the first largest ever multi-modal 3D scene dataset and benchmark with hierarchical grounded language annotations, MMScan. It is constructed based on a top-down logic, from region to object level, from a single target to inter-target relationships, covering holistic aspects of spatial and attribute understanding. The overall pipeline incorporates powerful VLMs via carefully designed prompts to initialize the annotations efficiently and further involve humans' correction in the loop to ensure the annotations are natural, correct, and comprehensive. Built upon existing 3D scanning data, the resulting multi-modal 3D dataset encompasses 1.4M meta-annotated captions on 109k objects and 7.7k regions as well as over 3.04M diverse samples for 3D visual grounding and question-answering benchmarks. We evaluate representative baselines on our benchmarks, analyze their capabilities in different aspects, and showcase the key problems to be addressed in the future.

Although key presses can be directly derived from sheet music, the transitional movements among key presses require more extensive guidance in piano performance. In this work, we construct a piano-hand motion generation benchmark to guide hand movements and fingerings for piano playing. To this end, we collect an annotated dataset, PianoMotion10M, consisting of 116 hours of piano playing videos from a bird's-eye view with 10 million annotated hand poses. We also introduce a powerful baseline model that generates hand motions from piano audios through a position predictor and a position-guided gesture generator. Furthermore, a series of evaluation metrics are designed to assess the performance of the baseline model, including motion similarity, smoothness, positional accuracy of left and right hands, and overall fidelity of movement distribution. Despite that piano key presses with respect to music scores or audios are already accessible, PianoMotion10M aims to provide guidance on piano fingering for instruction purposes.

Often, in fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, and data science, among others, these workflows are complex and are executed in large-scale, distributed, and heterogeneous computing environments prone to failures and performance degradation. Therefore, anomaly detection for workflows is an important paradigm that aims to identify unexpected behavior or errors in workflow execution. This crucial task to improve the reliability of workflow executions can be further assisted by machine learning-based techniques. However, such application is limited, in large part, due to the lack of open datasets and benchmarking. To address this gap, we make the following contributions in this paper: (1) we systematically inject anomalies and collect raw execution logs from workflows executing on distributed infrastructures; (2) we summarize the statistics of new datasets, and provide insightful analyses; (3) we convert workflows into tabular, graph and text data, and benchmark with supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection techniques correspondingly.

Existing research has explored LLM performance on temporal reasoning using diverse datasets and benchmarks. However, these studies often rely on real-world data that LLMs may have encountered during pre-training or employ anonymization techniques that can inadvertently introduce factual inconsistencies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing novel synthetic datasets specifically designed to assess LLM temporal reasoning abilities in various scenarios. The diversity of question types across these datasets enables systematic investigation into the impact of the problem structure, size, question type, fact order, and other factors on LLM performance. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in temporal reasoning tasks.

Current research primarily focuses on the segmentation of single-frame DSA using proprietary datasets. However, these methods face challenges due to the inherent limitation of single-frame DSA, which only partially displays vascular contrast, thereby hindering accurate vascular structure representation. In this work, we introduce DIAS, a dataset specifically developed for IA segmentation in DSA sequences. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DIAS, covering full, weak, and semi-supervised segmentation methods. Specifically, we propose the vessel sequence segmentation network, in which the sequence feature extraction module effectively captures spatiotemporal representations of intravascular contrast, achieving intracranial artery segmentation in 2D+Time DSA sequences. For weakly-supervised IA segmentation, we propose a novel scribble learning-based image segmentation framework, which, under the guidance of scribble labels, employs cross pseudo-supervision and consistency regularization to improve the performance of the segmentation network. Furthermore, we introduce the random patch-based self-training framework, aimed at alleviating the performance constraints encountered in IA segmentation due to the limited availability of annotated DSA data. Our extensive experiments on the DIAS dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods as potential baselines for future research and clinical applications.

We propose WikES, a comprehensive benchmark comprising of entities, their summaries, and their connections. Additionally, WikES features a dataset generator to test entity summarization algorithms in different areas of the knowledge graph. Importantly, our approach combines graph algorithms and NLP models as well as different data sources such that WikES does not require human annotation, rendering the approach cost-effective and generalizable to multiple domains.

While recent efforts have achieved high-performance image classification and high-quality image reconstruction from brain signals collected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG), the expensiveness and bulkiness of these devices make relevant applications difficult to generalize to practical applications. On the other hand, Electroencephalography (EEG), despite its advantages of ease of use, cost-efficiency, high temporal resolution, and non-invasive nature, has not been fully explored in relevant studies due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce EEG-ImageNet, a novel EEG dataset comprising recordings from 16 subjects exposed to 4000 images selected from the ImageNet dataset. EEG-ImageNet consists of 5 times EEG-image pairs larger than existing similar EEG benchmarks. EEG-ImageNet is collected with image stimuli of multi-granularity labels, i.e., 40 images with coarse-grained labels and 40 with fine-grained labels. Based on it, we establish benchmarks for object classification and image reconstruction. Experiments with several commonly used models show that the best models can achieve object classification with accuracy around 60% and image reconstruction with two-way identification around 64%. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential to advance EEG-based visual brain-computer interfaces, understand the visual perception of biological systems, and provide potential applications in improving machine visual models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, scientific publications that document these workflows are extensive and unstructured. This makes it difficult for both human researchers and AI systems to effectively navigate and explore the space of scientific innovation. To address this issue, we introduce MASSW, a comprehensive text dataset on Multi-Aspect Summarization of Scientific Workflows. MASSW includes more than 152,000 peer-reviewed publications from 17 leading computer science conferences spanning the past 50 years. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we automatically extract five core aspects from these publications -- context, key idea, method, outcome, and projected impact -- which correspond to five key steps in the research workflow. These structured summaries facilitate a variety of downstream tasks and analyses. The quality of the LLM-extracted summaries is validated by comparing them with human annotations. We demonstrate the utility of MASSW through multiple novel machine-learning tasks that can be benchmarked using this new dataset, which make various types of predictions and recommendations along the scientific workflow. MASSW holds significant potential for researchers to create and benchmark new AI methods for optimizing scientific workflows and fostering scientific innovation in the field.

| **[ACDC: The Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for Robust Semantic Driving Scene Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13395v4)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Level-5 driving automation requires a robust visual perception system that can parse input images under any condition. However, existing driving datasets for dense semantic perception are either dominated by images captured under normal conditions or are small in scale. To address this, we introduce ACDC, the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for training and testing methods for diverse semantic perception tasks on adverse visual conditions. ACDC consists of a large set of 8012 images, half of which (4006) are equally distributed between four common adverse conditions: fog, nighttime, rain, and snow. Each adverse-condition image comes with a high-quality pixel-level panoptic annotation, a corresponding image of the same scene under normal conditions, and a binary mask that distinguishes between intra-image regions of clear and uncertain semantic content. 1503 of the corresponding normal-condition images feature panoptic annotations, raising the total annotated images to 5509. ACDC supports the standard tasks of semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation, as well as the newly introduced uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation. A detailed empirical study demonstrates the challenges that the adverse domains of ACDC pose to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised approaches and indicates the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.

Following this training paradigm, the community has put massive efforts from diverse aspects including framework, performance, and privacy. However, an unpleasant fact is that there are currently no realistic datasets and benchmarks for FedLLM and previous works all rely on artificially constructed datasets, failing to capture properties in real-world scenarios. Addressing this, we propose FedLLM-Bench, which involves 8 training methods, 4 training datasets, and 6 evaluation metrics, to offer a comprehensive testbed for the FedLLM community. FedLLM-Bench encompasses three datasets (e.g., user-annotated multilingual dataset) for federated instruction tuning and one dataset (e.g., user-annotated preference dataset) for federated preference alignment, whose scale of client number ranges from 38 to 747. Our datasets incorporate several representative diversities: language, quality, quantity, instruction, length, embedding, and preference, capturing properties in real-world scenarios. Based on FedLLM-Bench, we conduct experiments on all datasets to benchmark existing FL methods and provide empirical insights (e.g., multilingual collaboration). We believe that our FedLLM-Bench can benefit the FedLLM community by reducing required efforts, providing a practical testbed, and promoting fair comparisons.

To evaluate complex reasoning in LLMs more fully, we present FanOutQA, a high-quality dataset of fan-out question-answer pairs and human-annotated decompositions with English Wikipedia as the knowledge base. We formulate three benchmark settings across our dataset and benchmark 7 LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 2, Claude-2.1, and Mixtral-8x7B, finding that contemporary models still have room to improve reasoning over inter-document dependencies in a long context.

However, they also pose misuse risks. Therefore, detecting AI-generated faces becomes crucial, yet current detectors show biased performance across different demographic groups. Mitigating biases can be done by designing algorithmic fairness methods, which usually require demographically annotated face datasets for model training. However, no existing dataset comprehensively encompasses both demographic attributes and diverse generative methods, which hinders the development of fair detectors for AI-generated faces. In this work, we introduce the AI-Face dataset, the first million-scale demographically annotated AI-generated face image dataset, including real faces, faces from deepfake videos, and faces generated by Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models. Based on this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive fairness benchmark to assess various AI face detectors and provide valuable insights and findings to promote the future fair design of AI face detectors.

However, conventional calibration is laborious and requires dedicated collection. Recent efforts show that learning-based solutions have the potential to be used in place of the repeatability works of manual calibrations. Among these solutions, various learning strategies, networks, geometric priors, and datasets have been investigated. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of learning-based camera calibration techniques, by analyzing their strengths and limitations. Our main calibration categories include the standard pinhole camera model, distortion camera model, cross-view model, and cross-sensor model, following the research trend and extended applications. As there is no benchmark in this community, we collect a holistic calibration dataset that can serve as a public platform to evaluate the generalization of existing methods. It comprises both synthetic and real-world data, with images and videos captured by different cameras in diverse scenes. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide further research directions. To our knowledge, this is the first survey for the learning-based camera calibration (spanned 8 years).

While these systems have the potential to supplement typical analysis workflows of data analysts in enterprise data platforms, unfortunately, CASs are subject to the same data discovery challenges that analysts have encountered over the years -- silos of multimodal data sources, created across teams and departments within an organization, make it difficult to identify appropriate data sources for accomplishing the task at hand. Existing data discovery benchmarks do not model such multimodality and multiplicity of data sources. Moreover, benchmarks of CASs prioritize only evaluating end-to-end task performance. To catalyze research on evaluating the data discovery performance of multimodal data retrievers in CASs within a real-world setting, we propose CMDBench, a benchmark modeling the complexity of enterprise data platforms. We adapt existing datasets and benchmarks in open-domain -- from question answering and complex reasoning tasks to natural language querying over structured data -- to evaluate coarse- and fine-grained data discovery and task execution performance. Our experiments reveal the impact of data retriever design on downstream task performance -- a 46% drop in task accuracy on average -- across various modalities, data sources, and task difficulty. The results indicate the need to develop optimization strategies to identify appropriate LLM agents and retrievers for efficient execution of CASs over enterprise data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gover...</summary><p>Governance, Understanding and Integration of Data for Effective and Responsible AI (GUIDE-AI '24), June 14, 2024, Santiago, AA, Chile</p></details> | None |

By capturing omnidirectional views of a scene, these cameras could expedite building environment models that are essential for visual localization. However, such an advantage is often overlooked due to the lack of valuable datasets. This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset, 360Loc, composed of 360$^\circ$ images with ground truth poses for visual localization. We present a practical implementation of 360$^\circ$ mapping combining 360$^\circ$ images with lidar data to generate the ground truth 6DoF poses. 360Loc is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of cross-device visual positioning, involving 360$^\circ$ reference frames, and query frames from pinhole, ultra-wide FoV fisheye, and 360$^\circ$ cameras. We propose a virtual camera approach to generate lower-FoV query frames from 360$^\circ$ images, which ensures a fair comparison of performance among different query types in visual localization tasks. We also extend this virtual camera approach to feature matching-based and pose regression-based methods to alleviate the performance loss caused by the cross-device domain gap, and evaluate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art baselines. We demonstrate that omnidirectional visual localization is more robust in challenging large-scale scenes with symmetries and repetitive structures. These results provide new insights into 360-camera mapping and omnidirectional visual localization with cross-device queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

Given sets of labeled web texts for training, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing can be applied to automatically detect such risks. We publish a dataset of 7,546 short texts describing public food recall announcements. Each text is manually labeled, on two granularity levels (coarse and fine), for food products and hazards that the recall corresponds to. We describe the dataset and benchmark naive, traditional, and Transformer models. Based on our analysis, Logistic Regression based on a tf-idf representation outperforms RoBERTa and XLM-R on classes with low support. Finally, we discuss different prompting strategies and present an LLM-in-the-loop framework, based on Conformal Prediction, which boosts the performance of the base classifier while reducing energy consumption compared to normal prompting.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present VietMed - a Vietnamese speech recognition dataset in the medical domain comprising 16h of labeled medical speech, 1000h of unlabeled medical speech and 1200h of unlabeled general-domain speech. To our best knowledge, VietMed is by far the world's largest public medical speech recognition dataset in 7 aspects: total duration, number of speakers, diseases, recording conditions, speaker roles, unique medical terms and accents. VietMed is also by far the largest public Vietnamese speech dataset in terms of total duration. Additionally, we are the first to present a medical ASR dataset covering all ICD-10 disease groups and all accents within a country. Moreover, we release the first public large-scale pre-trained models for Vietnamese ASR, w2v2-Viet and XLSR-53-Viet, along with the first public large-scale fine-tuned models for medical ASR. Even without any medical data in unsupervised pre-training, our best pre-trained model XLSR-53-Viet generalizes very well to the medical domain by outperforming state-of-the-art XLSR-53, from 51.8% to 29.6% WER on test set (a relative reduction of more than 40%).

However, indoor scenarios are rather static in terms of thermal state changes and, thus, cannot be applied to dynamic conditions, e.g., inside a vehicle. In this work, we present our findings of a gap between building and in-vehicle scenarios regarding thermal comfort estimation. We provide evidence by comparing deep neural classifiers for thermal comfort estimation for indoor and in-vehicle conditions. Further, we introduce a temporal dataset for indoor predictions incorporating 31 input signals and self-labeled user ratings by 18 subjects in a self-built climatic chamber. For in-vehicle scenarios, we acquired a second dataset featuring human judgments from 20 subjects in a BMW 3 Series. Our experimental results indicate superior performance for estimations from time series data over single vector input. Leveraging modern machine learning architectures enables us to recognize human thermal comfort states and estimate future states automatically. We provide details on training a recurrent network-based classifier and perform an initial performance benchmark of the proposed dataset. Ultimately, we compare our collected dataset to publicly available thermal comfort datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

This effort has attracted substantial interest from both industry and academy, highlighting its significance in the current technological landscape. Most datasets in this area are primarily focused on Key Information Extraction (KIE), where the extraction process revolves around extracting information using a specific, predefined set of keys. Unlike most existing datasets and benchmarks, our focus is on discovering key-value pairs (KVPs) without relying on predefined keys, navigating through an array of diverse templates and complex layouts. This task presents unique challenges, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and benchmarks tailored for non-predetermined KVP extraction. To address this gap, we introduce KVP10k , a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed for KVP extraction. The dataset contains 10707 richly annotated images. In our benchmark, we also introduce a new challenging task that combines elements of KIE as well as KVP in a single task. KVP10k sets itself apart with its extensive diversity in data and richly detailed annotations, paving the way for advancements in the field of information extraction from complex business documents.</p></details> | accepted ICDAR2024 | None |

Lately, the use of synthetic data to complement or replace genuine data for the training of FR models has been proposed.

In this work, we introduce a new method, inspired by the physical motion of soft particles subjected to stochastic Brownian forces, allowing us to sample identities distributions in a latent space under various constraints. With this in hands, we generate several face datasets and benchmark them by training FR models, showing that data generated with our method exceeds the performance of previously GAN-based datasets and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art diffusion-based synthetic datasets.

To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

However, their reliance on densely sampled LiDAR point clouds and meticulously calibrated sensor arrays poses challenges for real-world applications. Issues such as sensor misalignment, miscalibration, and disparate sampling frequencies lead to spatial and temporal misalignment in data from LiDAR and cameras.

However, fake utterances in previous datasets are mostly generated by altering timbre, prosody, linguistic content or channel noise of original audio. These datasets leave out a scenario, in which the acoustic scene of an original audio is manipulated with a forged one. It will pose a major threat to our society if some people misuse the manipulated audio with malicious purpose. Therefore, this motivates us to fill in the gap. This paper proposes such a dataset for scene fake audio detection named SceneFake, where a manipulated audio is generated by only tampering with the acoustic scene of an real utterance by using speech enhancement technologies. Some scene fake audio detection benchmark results on the SceneFake dataset are reported in this paper. In addition, an analysis of fake attacks with different speech enhancement technologies and signal-to-noise ratios are presented in this paper. The results indicate that scene fake utterances cannot be reliably detected by baseline models trained on the ASVspoof 2019 dataset. Although these models perform well on the SceneFake training set and seen testing set, their performance is poor on the unseen test set.

This task involves describing complex visual environments, identifying active objects, and interpreting their changes as conveyed through language. Traditional methods, which isolate object captioning and state change detection, offer a limited view of dynamic environments. Moreover, relying on a small set of symbolic words to represent changes has restricted the expressiveness of the language. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the Object State Captioning and State Change Representation (OSCaR) dataset and benchmark. OSCaR consists of 14,084 annotated video segments with nearly 1,000 unique objects from various egocentric video collections. It sets a new testbed for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our experiments demonstrate that while MLLMs show some skill, they lack a full understanding of object state changes. The benchmark includes a fine-tuned model that, despite initial capabilities, requires significant improvements in accuracy and generalization ability for effective understanding of these changes.

As a result, the research community has produced new databases and analytics engines to process such data. Unfortunately, there is not yet widespread benchmark standardization in graph processing, and the heterogeneity of evaluations found in the literature can lead researchers astray. Evaluations frequently ignore datasets' statistical idiosyncrasies, which significantly affect system performance. Scalability studies often use datasets that fit easily in memory on a modest desktop. Some studies rely on synthetic graph generators, but these generators produce graphs with unnatural characteristics that also affect performance, producing misleading results. Currently, the community has no consistent and principled manner with which to compare systems and provide guidance to developers who wish to select the system most suited to their application. We provide three different systematizations of benchmarking practices. First, we present a 12-year literary review of graph processing benchmarking, including a summary of the prevalence of specific datasets and benchmarks used in these papers. Second, we demonstrate the impact of two statistical properties of datasets that drastically affect benchmark performance. We show how different assignments of IDs to vertices, called vertex orderings, dramatically alter benchmark performance due to the caching behavior they induce. We also show the impact of zero-degree vertices on the runtime of benchmarks such as breadth-first search and single-source shortest path. We show that these issues can cause performance to change by as much as 38% on several popular graph processing systems. Finally, we suggest best practices to account for these issues when evaluating graph systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Real Acoustic Fields: An Audio-Visual Room Acoustics Dataset and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18821v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new dataset called Real Acoustic Fields (RAF) that captures real acoustic room data from multiple modalities. The dataset includes high-quality and densely captured room impulse response data paired with multi-view images, and precise 6DoF pose tracking data for sound emitters and listeners in the rooms. We used this dataset to evaluate existing methods for novel-view acoustic synthesis and impulse response generation which previously relied on synthetic data. In our evaluation, we thoroughly assessed existing audio and audio-visual models against multiple criteria and proposed settings to enhance their performance on real-world data. We also conducted experiments to investigate the impact of incorporating visual data (i.e., images and depth) into neural acoustic field models. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a simple sim2real approach, where a model is pre-trained with simulated data and fine-tuned with sparse real-world data, resulting in significant improvements in the few-shot learning approach. RAF is the first dataset to provide densely captured room acoustic data, making it an ideal resource for researchers working on audio and audio-visual neural acoustic field modeling techniques.

| **[HoloVIC: Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Multi-Sensor Holographic Intersection and Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02640v3)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is a popular topic in the field of Autonomous Driving in recent years. Vehicle-infrastructure cooperation (VIC) becomes one of the important research area. Due to the complexity of traffic conditions such as blind spots and occlusion, it greatly limits the perception capabilities of single-view roadside sensing systems. To further enhance the accuracy of roadside perception and provide better information to the vehicle side, in this paper, we constructed holographic intersections with various layouts to build a large-scale multi-sensor holographic vehicle-infrastructure cooperation dataset, called HoloVIC. Our dataset includes 3 different types of sensors (Camera, Lidar, Fisheye) and employs 4 sensor-layouts based on the different intersections. Each intersection is equipped with 6-18 sensors to capture synchronous data. While autonomous vehicles pass through these intersections for collecting VIC data. HoloVIC contains in total on 100k+ synchronous frames from different sensors. Additionally, we annotated 3D bounding boxes based on Camera, Fisheye, and Lidar. We also associate the IDs of the same objects across different devices and consecutive frames in sequence. Based on HoloVIC, we formulated four tasks to facilitate the development of related research. We also provide benchmarks for these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to CVPR 2024, Benchmark Website: https://holovic.net</p></details> | None |
| **[P2ANet: A Dataset and Benchmark for Dense Action Detection from Table Tennis Match Broadcasting Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12730v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning has been widely used for video analytics, such as video classification and action detection, dense action detection with fast-moving subjects from sports videos is still challenging. In this work, we release yet another sports video benchmark \TheName{} for \emph{\underline{P}}ing \emph{\underline{P}}ong-\emph{\underline{A}}ction detection, which consists of 2,721 video clips collected from the broadcasting videos of professional table tennis matches in World Table Tennis Championships and Olympiads. We work with a crew of table tennis professionals and referees on a specially designed annotation toolbox to obtain fine-grained action labels (in 14 classes) for every ping-pong action that appeared in the dataset, and formulate two sets of action detection problems -- \emph{action localization} and \emph{action recognition}. We evaluate a number of commonly-seen action recognition (e.g., TSM, TSN, Video SwinTransformer, and Slowfast) and action localization models (e.g., BSN, BSN++, BMN, TCANet), using \TheName{} for both problems, under various settings. These models can only achieve 48\% area under the AR-AN curve for localization and 82\% top-one accuracy for recognition since the ping-pong actions are dense with fast-moving subjects but broadcasting videos are with only 25 FPS. The results confirm that \TheName{} is still a challenging task and can be used as a special benchmark for dense action detection from videos.</p></details> |  | None |
