| **[ReVision: A Dataset and Baseline VLM for Privacy-Preserving Task-Oriented Visual Instruction Rewriting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14780v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and privacy-preserving multimodal interaction is essential as AR, VR, and modern smartphones with powerful cameras become primary interfaces for human-computer communication. Existing powerful large vision-language models (VLMs) enabling multimodal interaction often rely on cloud-based processing, raising significant concerns about (1) visual privacy by transmitting sensitive vision data to servers, and (2) their limited real-time, on-device usability. This paper explores Visual Instruction Rewriting, a novel approach that transforms multimodal instructions into text-only commands, allowing seamless integration of lightweight on-device instruction rewriter VLMs (250M parameters) with existing conversational AI systems, enhancing vision data privacy. To achieve this, we present a dataset of over 39,000 examples across 14 domains and develop a compact VLM, pretrained on image captioning datasets and fine-tuned for instruction rewriting. Experimental results, evaluated through NLG metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, along with semantic parsing analysis, demonstrate that even a quantized version of the model (<500MB storage footprint) can achieve effective instruction rewriting, thus enabling privacy-focused, multimodal AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[MedXpertQA: Benchmarking Expert-Level Medical Reasoning and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18362v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MedXpertQA, a highly challenging and comprehensive benchmark to evaluate expert-level medical knowledge and advanced reasoning. MedXpertQA includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, Text for text evaluation and MM for multimodal evaluation. Notably, MM introduces expert-level exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions. MedXpertQA applies rigorous filtering and augmentation to address the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA, and incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness. We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability. We evaluate 16 leading models on MedXpertQA. Moreover, medicine is deeply connected to real-world decision-making, providing a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. To this end, we develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AuroraCap: Efficient, Performant Video Detailed Captioning and a New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03051v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video detailed captioning is a key task which aims to generate comprehensive and coherent textual descriptions of video content, benefiting both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we propose AuroraCap, a video captioner based on a large multimodal model. We follow the simplest architecture design without additional parameters for temporal modeling. To address the overhead caused by lengthy video sequences, we implement the token merging strategy, reducing the number of input visual tokens. Surprisingly, we found that this strategy results in little performance loss. AuroraCap shows superior performance on various video and image captioning benchmarks, for example, obtaining a CIDEr of 88.9 on Flickr30k, beating GPT-4V (55.3) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (82.2). However, existing video caption benchmarks only include simple descriptions, consisting of a few dozen words, which limits research in this field. Therefore, we develop VDC, a video detailed captioning benchmark with over one thousand carefully annotated structured captions. In addition, we propose a new LLM-assisted metric VDCscore for bettering evaluation, which adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to transform long caption evaluation into multiple short question-answer pairs. With the help of human Elo ranking, our experiments show that this benchmark better correlates with human judgments of video detailed captioning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[A Chain-of-Thought Subspace Meta-Learning for Few-shot Image Captioning with Large Vision and Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13942v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large-scale vision and language model that has been pretrained on massive data encodes visual and linguistic prior, which makes it easier to generate images and language that are more natural and realistic. Despite this, there is still a significant domain gap between the modalities of vision and language, especially when training data is scarce in few-shot settings, where only very limited data are available for training. In order to mitigate this issue, a multi-modal meta-learning framework has been proposed to bridge the gap between two frozen pretrained large vision and language models by introducing a tunable prompt connecting these two large models. For few-shot image captioning, the existing multi-model meta-learning framework utilizes a one-step prompting scheme to accumulate the visual features of input images to guide the language model, which struggles to generate accurate image descriptions with only a few training samples. Instead, we propose a chain-of-thought (CoT) meta-learning scheme as a multi-step image captioning procedure to better imitate how humans describe images. In addition, we further propose to learn different meta-parameters of the model corresponding to each CoT step in distinct subspaces to avoid interference. We evaluated our method on three commonly used image captioning datasets, i.e., MSCOCO, Flickr8k, and Flickr30k, under few-shot settings. The results of our experiments indicate that our chain-of-thought subspace meta-learning strategy is superior to the baselines in terms of performance across different datasets measured by different metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[GroundCap: A Visually Grounded Image Captioning Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13898v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current image captioning systems lack the ability to link descriptive text to specific visual elements, making their outputs difficult to verify. While recent approaches offer some grounding capabilities, they cannot track object identities across multiple references or ground both actions and objects simultaneously. We propose a novel ID-based grounding system that enables consistent object reference tracking and action-object linking, and present GroundCap, a dataset containing 52,016 images from 77 movies, with 344 human-annotated and 52,016 automatically generated captions. Each caption is grounded on detected objects (132 classes) and actions (51 classes) using a tag system that maintains object identity while linking actions to the corresponding objects. Our approach features persistent object IDs for reference tracking, explicit action-object linking, and segmentation of background elements through K-means clustering. We propose gMETEOR, a metric combining caption quality with grounding accuracy, and establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Pixtral-12B. Human evaluation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in producing verifiable descriptions with coherent object references.</p></details> | 37 pages | None |
| **[Pretrained Image-Text Models are Secretly Video Captioners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13363v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing video captioning models is computationally expensive. The dynamic nature of video also complicates the design of multimodal models that can effectively caption these sequences. However, we find that by using minimal computational resources and without complex modifications to address video dynamics, an image-based model can be repurposed to outperform several specialised video captioning systems. Our adapted model demonstrates top tier performance on major benchmarks, ranking 2nd on MSRVTT and MSVD, and 3rd on VATEX. We transform it into a competitive video captioner by post training a typical image captioning model BLIP2 with only 6,000 video text pairs and simply concatenating frames (significantly fewer data than other methods), which use 2.5 to 144 million pairs. From a resource optimization perspective, this video captioning study focuses on three fundamental factors: optimizing model scale, maximizing data efficiency, and incorporating reinforcement learning. This extensive study demonstrates that a lightweight, image based adaptation strategy can rival state-of-the-art video captioning systems, offering a practical solution for low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025).

| **[SynthVLM: High-Efficiency and High-Quality Synthetic Data for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20756v4)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged, demonstrating remarkable vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires large-scale datasets, which brings challenges related to efficiency, effectiveness, quality, and privacy of web data. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis and curation method for generating image-caption pairs. Unlike traditional methods, where captions are generated from images, SynthVLM utilizes advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically synthesize and select high-resolution images from text descriptions, thereby creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. To demonstrate the power of SynthVLM, we introduce SynthVLM-100K, a high-quality dataset consisting of 100,000 curated and synthesized image-caption pairs. In both model and human evaluations, SynthVLM-100K outperforms traditional real-world datasets. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B, which achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various vision question-answering (VQA) tasks. Notably, our models outperform LLaVA across most metrics with only 18\% pretrain data. Furthermore, SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B attain SOTA performance on the MMLU benchmark, demonstrating that the high-quality SynthVLM-100K dataset preserves language abilities. To facilitate future research, our dataset and the complete data generating and curating methods are open-sourced at https://github.com/starriver030515/SynthVLM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/starriver030515/SynthVLM) |
| **[Evaluation of Multilingual Image Captioning: How far can we get with CLIP models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06600v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of image captions, looking at both linguistic fluency and semantic correspondence to visual contents, has witnessed a significant effort. Still, despite advancements such as the CLIPScore metric, multilingual captioning evaluation has remained relatively unexplored. This work presents several strategies, and extensive experiments, related to evaluating CLIPScore variants in multilingual settings. To address the lack of multilingual test data, we consider two different strategies: (1) using quality aware machine-translated datasets with human judgements, and (2) re-purposing multilingual datasets that target semantic inference and reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of finetuned multilingual models to generalize across languages and to handle complex linguistic challenges. Tests with machine-translated data show that multilingual CLIPScore models can maintain a high correlation with human judgements across different languages, and additional tests with natively multilingual and multicultural data further attest to the high-quality assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Findings of NAACL 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Do we Really Need Visual Instructions? Towards Visual Instruction-Free Fine-tuning for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11427v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual instruction tuning has become the predominant technology in eliciting the multimodal task-solving capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Despite the success, as visual instructions require images as the input, it would leave the gap in inheriting the task-solving capabilities from the backbone LLMs, and make it costly to collect a large-scale dataset. To address it, we propose ViFT, a visual instruction-free fine-tuning framework for LVLMs. In ViFT, we only require the text-only instructions and image caption data during training, to separately learn the task-solving and visual perception abilities. During inference, we extract and combine the representations of the text and image inputs, for fusing the two abilities to fulfill multimodal tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ViFT can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several visual reasoning and visual instruction following benchmarks, with rather less training data. Our code and data will be publicly released.</p></details> | under review | None |
| **[MFC-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Fact-Checking with Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11288v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have significantly improved multimodal reasoning tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. These models embed multimodal facts within their parameters, rather than relying on external knowledge bases to store factual information explicitly. However, the content discerned by LVLMs may deviate from factuality due to inherent bias or incorrect inference. To address this issue, we introduce MFC-Bench, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of LVLMs across three stages of verdict prediction for MFC: Manipulation, Out-of-Context, and Veracity Classification. Through our evaluation on MFC-Bench, we benchmarked a dozen diverse and representative LVLMs, uncovering that current models still fall short in multimodal fact-checking and demonstrate insensitivity to various forms of manipulated content. We hope that MFC-Bench could raise attention to the trustworthy AI potentially assisted by LVLMs in the future. The MFC-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://github.com/wskbest/MFC-Bench, contributing to ongoing research in the multimodal fact-checking field.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/wskbest/MFC-Bench) |
| **[TPCap: Unlocking Zero-Shot Image Captioning with Trigger-Augmented and Multi-Modal Purification Modules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11024v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the fluency and logical coherence of image captioning. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted to incorporate external knowledge into LLMs; however, existing RAG-based methods rely on separate retrieval banks, introducing computational overhead and limiting the utilization of LLMs' inherent zero-shot capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose TPCap, a novel trigger-augmented and multi-modal purification framework for zero-shot image captioning without external retrieval libraries. TPCap consists of two key components: trigger-augmented (TA) generation and multi-modal purification (MP). The TA module employs a trigger projector with frozen and learnable projections to activate LLMs' contextual reasoning, enhance visual-textual alignment, and mitigate data bias. The MP module further refines the generated entity-related information by filtering noise and enhancing feature quality, ensuring more precise and factually consistent captions. We evaluate TPCap on COCO, NoCaps, Flickr30k, and WHOOPS datasets. With only 0.82M trainable parameters and training on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, TPCap achieves competitive performance comparable to state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[REAL: Realism Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Effective Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10663v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation models have transformed the field. However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like image captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this challenge, we introduce VisCon-100K, a novel dataset derived from interleaved image-text web documents. Our approach transforms 45K web documents from the OBELICS dataset into 100K image conversation samples. We utilize GPT-4V to generate image-contextual captions and OpenChat 3.5 model to convert these captions into diverse free-form and multiple-choice question-answer pairs. Integrating this dataset for fine-tuning considerably enhances VLM performance across multiple benchmarks. Unlike methods that focus solely on fine-grained visual content, our approach leverages accompanying web context, yielding superior results. We also discover that a `leaky modality mix,' where conversation samples contain questions answerable from both the image and its contextual caption, outperforms non-leaky combinations of captions and Q\&A pairs. VisCon-100k dataset shows strong performance with two popular VLM approaches: text-only large language model (LLM) aligned with a vision encoder using image captions data (ShareGPT4V-7b) and multimodally pretrained LLM (IDEFICS2-8b) using interleaved image-text data. In addition to releasing the VisCon-100K dataset, we provide a contextual captioner trained on this dataset, facilitating scalable fine-tuning data generation for future research and open-source applications. Using the same pipeline, but substituting our trained contextual captioner for GPT-4V, we also release the larger VisCon-1M dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PAKDD 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Image Embedding Sampling Method for Diverse Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10118v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Captioning for state-of-the-art VLMs has significantly improved over time; however, this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity, making them less accessible for resource-constrained applications such as mobile devices and assistive technologies. Alternatively, smaller VLMs prioritize high-level scene descriptions, overlooking finer details that contribute to a richer understanding of an image. In this paper, we introduce a training-free framework that enhances caption diversity and informativeness by explicitly attending to distinct image regions using a comparably small VLM, BLIP, as the backbone. Our approach leverages structured segmentation to produce hierarchical representations that capture both global and localized semantics. Without requiring additional model training, we demonstrate that our method allows smaller VLMs to achieve performance comparable to larger models in terms of image-caption alignment, semantic integrity, and diversity. We evaluate our framework on MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Nocaps test datasets, achieving a Div-2 score of 0.735, 0.750, and 0.748 for each dataset respectively, while maintaining strong image-caption relevancy and semantic integrity with the human-annotated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[GAIA: A Global, Multi-modal, Multi-scale Vision-Language Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09598v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The continuous operation of Earth-orbiting satellites generates vast and ever-growing archives of Remote Sensing (RS) images. Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives. However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS. This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures | None |

In this setup, a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts feature representations from the input image, which then guide the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence caption generation process. Although much research has focused on refining the decoder, the quality of image representations from the encoder remains crucial for accurate captioning. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates features from two distinct CNN based encoders, capturing complementary information to enhance caption generation. Additionally, we propose a weighted averaging technique to combine the outputs of all GRUs in the stacked decoder. Furthermore, a comparison-based beam search strategy is incorporated to refine caption selection. The results demonstrate that our fusion-based approach, along with the enhanced stacked decoder, significantly outperforms both the transformer-based state-of-the-art model and other LSTM-based baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions.

While VLMs show impressive capabilities across domains such as autonomous vehicles, smart surveillance, and healthcare, their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to processing power, memory, and energy limitations. This survey explores recent advancements in optimizing VLMs for edge environments, focusing on model compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and specialized hardware solutions that enhance efficiency. We provide a detailed discussion of efficient training and fine-tuning methods, edge deployment challenges, and privacy considerations. Additionally, we discuss the diverse applications of lightweight VLMs across healthcare, environmental monitoring, and autonomous systems, illustrating their growing impact.

Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures | None |
| **[RS-MoE: A Vision-Language Model with Mixture of Experts for Remote Sensing Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01595v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) presents unique challenges and plays a critical role in applications. Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs, efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel Instruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From No to Know: Taxonomy, Challenges, and Opportunities for Negation Understanding in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09645v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negation, a linguistic construct conveying absence, denial, or contradiction, poses significant challenges for multilingual multimodal foundation models. These models excel in tasks like machine translation, text-guided generation, image captioning, audio interactions, and video processing but often struggle to accurately interpret negation across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this perspective paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of negation constructs, illustrating how structural, semantic, and cultural factors influence multimodal foundation models. We present open research questions and highlight key challenges, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues to achieve robust negation handling. Finally, we advocate for specialized benchmarks, language-specific tokenization, fine-grained attention mechanisms, and advanced multimodal architectures. These strategies can foster more adaptable and semantically precise multimodal foundation models, better equipped to navigate and accurately interpret the complexities of negation in multilingual, multimodal environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Investigating Prompting Techniques for Zero- and Few-Shot Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09996v3)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore effective prompting techniques to enhance zero- and few-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) performance in contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Central to our investigation is the role of question templates in guiding VLMs to generate accurate answers. We identify that specific templates significantly influence VQA outcomes, underscoring the need for strategic template selection. Another pivotal aspect of our study is augmenting VLMs with image captions, providing them with additional visual cues alongside direct image features in VQA tasks. Surprisingly, this augmentation significantly improves the VLMs' performance in many cases, even though VLMs "see" the image directly! We explore chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and find that while standard CoT reasoning causes drops in performance, advanced methods like self-consistency can help recover it. Furthermore, we find that text-only few-shot examples enhance VLMs' alignment with the task format, particularly benefiting models prone to verbose zero-shot answers. Lastly, to mitigate the challenges associated with evaluating free-form open-ended VQA responses using string-matching based VQA metrics, we introduce a straightforward LLM-guided pre-processing technique to adapt the model responses to the expected ground-truth answer distribution. In summary, our research sheds light on the intricacies of prompting strategies in VLMs for VQA, emphasizing the synergistic use of captions, templates, and pre-processing to enhance model efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/rabiulcste/vqazero</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/rabiulcste/vqazero) |
| **[What Is Missing in Multilingual Visual Reasoning and How to Fix It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01404v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NLP models today strive for supporting multiple languages and modalities, improving accessibility for diverse users. In this paper, we evaluate their multilingual, multimodal capabilities by testing on a visual reasoning task. We observe that proprietary systems like GPT-4V obtain the best performance on this task now, but open models lag in comparison. Surprisingly, GPT-4V exhibits similar performance between English and other languages, indicating the potential for equitable system development across languages. Our analysis on model failures reveals three key aspects that make this task challenging: multilinguality, complex reasoning, and multimodality. To address these challenges, we propose three targeted interventions including a translate-test approach to tackle multilinguality, a visual programming approach to break down complex reasoning, and a method that leverages image captioning to address multimodality. Our interventions achieve the best open performance on this task in a zero-shot setting, boosting open models LLaVA-v1.5-13B by 13.4%, LLaVA-v1.6-34B by 20.3%, and Qwen-VL by 16.7%, while also minorly improving GPT-4V's performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[How Culturally Aware are Vision-Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17475v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An image is often considered worth a thousand words, and certain images can tell rich and insightful stories. Can these stories be told via image captioning? Images from folklore genres, such as mythology, folk dance, cultural signs, and symbols, are vital to every culture. Our research compares the performance of four popular vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA, and OpenFlamingo) in identifying culturally specific information in such images and creating accurate and culturally sensitive image captions. We also propose a new evaluation metric, the Cultural Awareness Score (CAS), which measures the degree of cultural awareness in image captions. We provide a dataset MOSAIC-1.5k labeled with ground truth for images containing cultural background and context and a labeled dataset with assigned Cultural Awareness Scores that can be used with unseen data. Creating culturally appropriate image captions is valuable for scientific research and can be beneficial for many practical applications. We envision our work will promote a deeper integration of cultural sensitivity in AI applications worldwide. By making the dataset and Cultural Awareness Score available to the public, we aim to facilitate further research in this area, encouraging the development of more culturally aware AI systems that respect and celebrate global diversity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Linear Alignment of Vision-language Models for Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05591v4)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language models like CLIP have advanced the state of the art in a variety of multi-modal tasks including image captioning and caption evaluation. Many approaches leverage CLIP for cross-modal retrieval to condition pre-trained language models on visual input. However, CLIP generally suffers from a mis-alignment of image and text modalities in the joint embedding space. We investigate efficient methods to linearly re-align the joint embedding space for the downstream task of image captioning. This leads to an efficient training protocol that merely requires computing a closed-form solution for a linear mapping in the joint CLIP space. Consequently, we propose a lightweight captioning method called ReCap, which can be trained up to 1000 times faster than existing lightweight methods. Moreover, we propose two new learning-based image-captioning metrics built on CLIP score along with our proposed alignment. We evaluate ReCap on MS-COCO, Flickr30k, VizWiz and MSRVTT. On the former two, ReCap performs comparably to state-of-the-art lightweight methods using rule-based metrics while outperforming them on most of the CLIP-based metrics. On the latter two benchmarks, ReCap consistently outperforms competitors across all metrics and exhibits strong transfer capabilities and resilience to noise. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics correlate stronger with human judgement than existing metrics on the Flickr8k-Expert, Flickr8k-Crowdflower, and THumB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (+ references and appendix)</p></details> | None |

However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging the Visual Gap: Fine-Tuning Multimodal Models with Knowledge-Adapted Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09018v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> | None |

However, merely extracting text is insufficient when dealing with complex documents. Fully comprehending such documents requires an understanding of their structure -- including formatting, formulas, tables, and the reading order of multiple blocks and columns across multiple pages -- as well as semantic information for detecting elements like footnotes and image captions. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for downstream tasks such as retrieval, document question answering, and data curation for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this, we introduce \'Eclair, a general-purpose text-extraction tool specifically designed to process a wide range of document types. Given an image, \'Eclair is able to extract formatted text in reading order, along with bounding boxes and their corresponding semantic classes. To thoroughly evaluate these novel capabilities, we introduce our diverse human-annotated benchmark for document-level OCR and semantic classification. \'Eclair achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this benchmark, outperforming other methods across key metrics. Additionally, we evaluate \'Eclair on established benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and strength across several evaluation standards.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Decoder-Only LLMs are Better Controllers for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04412v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Groundbreaking advancements in text-to-image generation have recently been achieved with the emergence of diffusion models. These models exhibit a remarkable ability to generate highly artistic and intricately detailed images based on textual prompts. However, obtaining desired generation outcomes often necessitates repetitive trials of manipulating text prompts just like casting spells on a magic mirror, and the reason behind that is the limited capability of semantic understanding inherent in current image generation models. Specifically, existing diffusion models encode the text prompt input with a pre-trained encoder structure, which is usually trained on a limited number of image-caption pairs. The state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) based on the decoder-only structure have shown a powerful semantic understanding capability as their architectures are more suitable for training on very large-scale unlabeled data. In this work, we propose to enhance text-to-image diffusion models by borrowing the strength of semantic understanding from large language models, and devise a simple yet effective adapter to allow the diffusion models to be compatible with the decoder-only structure. Meanwhile, we also provide a supporting theoretical analysis with various architectures (e.g., encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only), and conduct extensive empirical evaluations to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the enhanced models with our adapter module are superior to the stat-of-the-art models in terms of text-to-image generation quality and reliability.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods adopt a two-stage pipeline: weakly supervised pre-training with image captions and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fully annotated scene graphs. Nonetheless, they omit explicit modeling of interacting objects and treat all objects equally, resulting in mismatched relation pairs. To this end, we propose an interaction-aware OVSGG framework INOVA. During pre-training, INOVA employs an interaction-aware target generation strategy to distinguish interacting objects from non-interacting ones. In SFT, INOVA devises an interaction-guided query selection tactic to prioritize interacting objects during bipartite graph matching. Besides, INOVA is equipped with an interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to enhance the robustness by pushing interacting object pairs away from the background. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks (VG and GQA) show that INOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-aware mechanisms for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches rely on 3D point clouds, which present challenges in encoding efficiency and neural network processing. With the advent of advanced LiDAR sensors like Ouster OS1, which, in addition to 3D point clouds, produce fixed resolution depth, signal, and ambient panoramic 2D images, new opportunities emerge for LiDAR based tasks. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to connect LiDAR data with text by leveraging 2D imagery generated by the OS1 sensor instead of 3D point clouds. Using the Florence 2 large model in a zero-shot setting, we perform image captioning and object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that Florence 2 generates more informative captions and achieves superior performance in object detection tasks compared to existing methods like CLIP. By combining advanced LiDAR sensor data with a large pre-trained model, our approach provides a robust and accurate solution for challenging detection scenarios, including real-time applications requiring high accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.</p></details> |  | None |

Building upon the COCO dataset with advanced COCONut panoptic masks, this dataset aims to overcome limitations in existing image-text datasets that often lack detailed, scene-comprehensive descriptions. The COCONut-PanCap dataset incorporates fine-grained, region-level captions grounded in panoptic segmentation masks, ensuring consistency and improving the detail of generated captions. Through human-edited, densely annotated descriptions, COCONut-PanCap supports improved training of vision-language models (VLMs) for image understanding and generative models for text-to-image tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that COCONut-PanCap significantly boosts performance across understanding and generation tasks, offering complementary benefits to large-scale datasets. This dataset sets a new benchmark for evaluating models on joint panoptic segmentation and grounded captioning tasks, addressing the need for high-quality, detailed image-text annotations in multi-modal learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://xdeng7.github.io/coconut.github.io/coconut_pancap.html</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xdeng7.github.io/coconut.github.io) |

Existing methods seek to mitigate these risks by applying constrained adversarial fine-tuning to CLIP vision encoders on ImageNet-scale data, ensuring their generalization ability is preserved. However, this limited adversarial training restricts robustness and broader generalization. In this work, we explore an alternative approach of leveraging existing vision classification models that have been adversarially pre-trained on large-scale data. Our analysis reveals two principal contributions: (1) the extensive scale and diversity of adversarial pre-training enables these models to demonstrate superior robustness against diverse adversarial threats, ranging from imperceptible perturbations to advanced jailbreaking attempts, without requiring additional adversarial training, and (2) end-to-end MLLM integration with these robust models facilitates enhanced adaptation of language components to robust visual features, outperforming existing plug-and-play methodologies on complex reasoning tasks. Through systematic evaluation across visual question-answering, image captioning, and jail-break attacks, we demonstrate that MLLMs trained with these robust models achieve superior adversarial robustness while maintaining favorable clean performance. Our framework achieves 2x and 1.5x average robustness gains in captioning and VQA tasks, respectively, and delivers over 10% improvement against jailbreak attacks.

Much current work in this area now uses transformers, applying a metaphor of machine translation from code to function names. Still, function naming models face challenges in generalizing to projects unrelated to the training set. In this paper, we take a completely new approach by transferring advances in automated image captioning to the domain of binary reverse engineering, such that different parts of a binary function can be associated with parts of its name. We propose BLens, which combines multiple binary function embeddings into a new ensemble representation, aligns it with the name representation latent space via a contrastive learning approach, and generates function names with a transformer architecture tailored for function names. Our experiments demonstrate that BLens significantly outperforms the state of the art. In the usual setting of splitting per binary, we achieve an $F_1$ score of 0.79 compared to 0.70. In the cross-project setting, which emphasizes generalizability, we achieve an $F_1$ score of 0.46 compared to 0.29. Finally, in an experimental setting reducing shared components across projects, we achieve an $F_1$ score of $0.32$ compared to $0.19$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (Usenix 2025). 20 pages, 5 figures.

High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging this multi-modal information effectively for VAD poses a significant challenge, as the model must identify action-relevant cues with precision. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-modal VAD architecture, referred to as the Joint Actor-centric Visual, Audio, Language Encoder (JoVALE). JoVALE is the first VAD method to integrate audio and visual features with scene descriptive context sourced from large-capacity image captioning models. At the heart of JoVALE is the actor-centric aggregation of audio, visual, and scene descriptive information, enabling adaptive integration of crucial features for recognizing each actor's actions. We have developed a Transformer-based architecture, the Actor-centric Multi-modal Fusion Network, specifically designed to capture the dynamic interactions among actors and their multi-modal contexts. Our evaluation on three prominent VAD benchmarks, including AVA, UCF101-24, and JHMDB51-21, demonstrates that incorporating multi-modal information significantly enhances performance, setting new state-of-the-art performances in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025, 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> | None |

Debunking them requires (1) providing the true context of the image and (2) checking the veracity of the image's caption. However, existing automated fact-checking methods fail to tackle both objectives explicitly. In this work, we introduce COVE, a new method that predicts first the true COntext of the image and then uses it to predict the VEracity of the caption. COVE beats the SOTA context prediction model on all context items, often by more than five percentage points. It is competitive with the best veracity prediction models on synthetic data and outperforms them on real-world data, showing that it is beneficial to combine the two tasks sequentially. Finally, we conduct a human study that reveals that the predicted context is a reusable and interpretable artifact to verify new out-of-context captions for the same image.

The latency improvement and accuracy in these techniques crucially depend on the criteria used to make exit decisions. We propose a new decision criterion where exit classifiers are treated as experts BEEM and aggregate their confidence scores. The confidence scores are aggregated only if neighbouring experts are consistent in prediction as the samples pass through them, thus capturing their ensemble effect. A sample exits when the aggregated confidence value exceeds a threshold. The threshold is set using the error rates of the intermediate exits aiming to surpass the performance of conventional DNN inference. Experimental results on the COCO dataset for Image captioning and GLUE datasets for various language tasks demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of state-of-the-art EE methods, achieving improvements in speed-up by a factor 1.5x to 2.1x. When compared to the final layer, its accuracy is comparable in harder Image Captioning and improves in the easier language tasks.

Built on top of LLMs, vision large language models (VLLMs) have advanced significantly in areas such as recognition, reasoning, and grounding. However, investigations into \emph{multimodal ICL} have predominantly focused on few-shot visual question answering (VQA), and image captioning, which we will show neither exploit the strengths of ICL, nor test its limitations. The broader capabilities and limitations of multimodal ICL remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark VL-ICL Bench for multimodal in-context learning, encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks that involve both images and text as inputs and outputs, and different types of challenges, from {perception to reasoning and long context length}. We evaluate the abilities of state-of-the-art VLLMs against this benchmark suite, revealing their diverse strengths and weaknesses, and showing that even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4, find the tasks challenging. By highlighting a range of new ICL tasks, and the associated strengths and limitations of existing models, we hope that our dataset will inspire future work on enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of VLLMs, as well as inspire new applications that leverage VLLM ICL.

We evaluate the methods on the Emotions in Context (EMOTIC) dataset and demonstrate that a vision language model, fine-tuned even on a small dataset, can significantly outperform traditional baselines.

For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text-driven Adaptation of Foundation Models for Few-shot Surgical Workflow Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09555v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Surgical workflow analysis is crucial for improving surgical efficiency and safety. However, previous studies rely heavily on large-scale annotated datasets, posing challenges in cost, scalability, and reliance on expert annotations. To address this, we propose Surg-FTDA (Few-shot Text-driven Adaptation), designed to handle various surgical workflow analysis tasks with minimal paired image-label data. Methods: Our approach has two key components. First, Few-shot selection-based modality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings with text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap. Second, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder, eliminating the need for paired image-text data. This decoder is then applied to aligned image embeddings, enabling image-related tasks without explicit image-text pairs. Results: We evaluate our approach to generative tasks (image captioning) and discriminative tasks (triplet recognition and phase recognition). Results show that Surg-FTDA outperforms baselines and generalizes well across downstream tasks. Conclusion: We propose a text-driven adaptation approach that mitigates the modality gap and handles multiple downstream tasks in surgical workflow analysis, with minimal reliance on large annotated datasets.

It is about predicting the most accurate caption given a specific image or video. The research community has achieved impressive results by continuously proposing new models and approaches to improve the overall model's performance. Nevertheless, despite increasing proposals, the performance metrics used to measure their advances have remained practically untouched through the years. A probe of that, nowadays metrics like BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE are still very used, aside from more sophisticated metrics such as BertScore and ClipScore. Hence, it is essential to adjust how are measure the advances, limitations, and scopes of the new image captioning proposals, as well as to adapt new metrics to these new advanced image captioning approaches. This work proposes a new evaluation metric for the image captioning problem. To do that, first, it was generated a human-labeled dataset to assess to which degree the captions correlate with the image's content. Taking these human scores as ground truth, we propose a new metric, and compare it with several well-known metrics, from classical to newer ones. Outperformed results were also found, and interesting insights were presented and discussed.</p></details> | 28 pages | None |

Variations in molecular images and caption subtasks pose a significant challenge in both image representation learning and task modeling. Yet, existing methods only focus on a specific caption task that translates a molecular image into its graph structure, i.e., OCSR. In this paper, we propose the Optical Chemical Structure Understanding (OCSU) task, which extends OCSR to molecular image caption from motif level to molecule level and abstract level. We present two approaches for that, including an OCSR-based method and an end-to-end OCSR-free method. The proposed Double-Check achieves SOTA OCSR performance on real-world patent and journal article scenarios via attentive feature enhancement for local ambiguous atoms. Cascading with SMILES-based molecule understanding methods, it can leverage the power of existing task-specific models for OCSU. While Mol-VL is an end-to-end optimized VLM-based model. An OCSU dataset, Vis-CheBI20, is built based on the widely used CheBI20 dataset for training and evaluation. Extensive experimental results on Vis-CheBI20 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Improving OCSR capability can lead to a better OCSU performance for OCSR-based approach, and the SOTA performance of Mol-VL demonstrates the great potential of end-to-end approach.</p></details> |  | None |

However, previous works only utilize the retrieved text as text prompts, and the visual information relies only on the CLIP visual embedding. Because of this issue, there is a limitation that the image descriptions inherent in the prompt are not sufficiently reflected in the visual embedding space. To tackle this issue, we propose ViPCap, a novel retrieval text-based visual prompt for lightweight image captioning. ViPCap leverages the retrieved text with image information as visual prompts to enhance the ability of the model to capture relevant visual information. By mapping text prompts into the CLIP space and generating multiple randomized Gaussian distributions, our method leverages sampling to explore randomly augmented distributions and effectively retrieves the semantic features that contain image information. These retrieved features are integrated into the image and designated as the visual prompt, leading to performance improvements on the datasets such as COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps. Experimental results demonstrate that ViPCap significantly outperforms prior lightweight captioning models in efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating the potential for a plug-and-play solution.

Existing research has focused primarily on aspects such as emotion classification, meme generation, propagation, interpretation, figurative language, and sociolinguistics, but has often overlooked deeper meme comprehension and meme-text retrieval. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClassicMemes-50-templates (CM50), a large-scale dataset consisting of over 33,000 memes, centered around 50 popular meme templates. We also present an automated knowledge-grounded annotation pipeline leveraging large vision-language models to produce high-quality image captions, meme captions, and literary device labels overcoming the labor intensive demands of manual annotation. Additionally, we propose a meme-text retrieval CLIP model (mtrCLIP) that utilizes cross-modal embedding to enhance meme analysis, significantly improving retrieval performance. Our contributions include:(1) a novel dataset for large-scale meme study, (2) a scalable meme annotation framework, and (3) a fine-tuned CLIP for meme-text retrieval, all aimed at advancing the understanding and analysis of memes at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables, GitHub repository: https://github.com/Seefreem/meme_text_retrieval_p1</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Seefreem/meme_text_retrieval_p1) |

Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar captions given an image. In this paper, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed Visual Minimal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions. The image pair and caption pair contain minimal changes, i.e., only one aspect changes at a time from among the following: object, attribute, count, and spatial relation. These changes test the models' understanding of objects, attributes (such as color, material, shape), counts, and spatial relationships between objects. We built an automatic framework using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators. Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities. We also generate a large-scale training dataset to finetune CLIP and Idefics2, showing significant improvements in fine-grained understanding across benchmarks and in CLIP's general image-text alignment. We release all resources, including the benchmark, training data, and finetuned model checkpoints, at https://vismin.net/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024.

Recently, deep learning models that utilize transformers have been the most successful in automatically generating image captions. The capabilities of transformer networks have led to notable progress in several activities related to vision. In this paper, we thoroughly examine transformer models, emphasizing the critical role that attention mechanisms play. The proposed model uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture to create textual captions and a deep learning convolutional neural network to extract features from the images. To create the captions, we present a novel ensemble learning framework that improves the richness of the generated captions by utilizing several deep neural network architectures based on a voting mechanism that chooses the caption with the highest bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) score. The proposed model was evaluated using publicly available datasets. Using the Flickr8K dataset, the proposed model achieved the highest BLEU-[1-3] scores with rates of 0.728, 0.495, and 0.323, respectively. The suggested model outperformed the latest methods in Flickr30k datasets, determined by BLEU-[1-4] scores with rates of 0.798, 0.561, 0.387, and 0.269, respectively. The model efficacy was also obtained by the Semantic propositional image caption evaluation (SPICE) metric with a scoring rate of 0.164 for the Flicker8k dataset and 0.387 for the Flicker30k. Finally, ensemble learning significantly advances the process of image captioning and, hence, can be leveraged in various applications across different domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing methods either distill the caption from the LMM models or construct the captions from the internet images or by human. We propose to leverage off-the-shelf visual specialists, which were trained from annotated images initially not for image captioning, for enhancing the image caption. Our approach, named DCE, explores object low-level and fine-grained attributes (e.g., depth, emotion and fine-grained categories) and object relations (e.g., relative location and human-object-interaction (HOI)), and combine the attributes into the descriptive caption. Experiments demonstrate that such visual specialists are able to improve the performance for visual understanding tasks as well as reasoning that benefits from more accurate visual understanding.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a target-aware prompting strategy. This method first extracts object labels and their spatial information from the image using an object detector. Then, an attribute predictor further refines the semantic features of the objects. These refined features are subsequently integrated and fed into the decoder, enhancing the model's understanding of the image context. Experimental results on the COCO and nocaps datasets demonstrate that OPCap effectively mitigates hallucination and significantly improves the quality of generated captions.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike previous approaches that resort to lightweight adversarial fine-tuning of a pre-trained CLIP model, we perform large-scale adversarial vision-language pre-training from scratch using web-scale data. We then strengthen the defense by incorporating adversarial visual instruction tuning. The resulting models from each stage, $\Delta$CLIP and $\Delta^2$LLaVA, show substantially enhanced zero-shot robustness and set a new state-of-the-art in adversarial defense for vision-language models. For example, the adversarial robustness of $\Delta$CLIP surpasses that of the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20%. %For example, $\Delta$CLIP surpasses the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20% in terms of adversarial robustness. Similarly, compared to prior art, $\Delta^2$LLaVA brings a ~30% robustness improvement to image captioning task and a ~20% robustness improvement to visual question answering task. Furthermore, our models exhibit stronger zero-shot recognition capability, fewer hallucinations, and superior reasoning performance compared to baselines.

However, progress toward generalist biomedical VLMs is limited by the lack of annotated, publicly accessible datasets across biology and medicine. Existing efforts are restricted to narrow domains, missing the full diversity of biomedical knowledge encoded in scientific literature. To address this gap, we introduce BIOMEDICA, a scalable, open-source framework to extract, annotate, and serialize the entirety of the PubMed Central Open Access subset into an easy-to-use, publicly accessible dataset. Our framework produces a comprehensive archive with over 24 million unique image-text pairs from over 6 million articles. Metadata and expert-guided annotations are also provided. We demonstrate the utility and accessibility of our resource by releasing BMCA-CLIP, a suite of CLIP-style models continuously pre-trained on the BIOMEDICA dataset via streaming, eliminating the need to download 27 TB of data locally. On average, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across 40 tasks - spanning pathology, radiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, surgery, molecular biology, parasitology, and cell biology - excelling in zero-shot classification with a 6.56% average improvement (as high as 29.8% and 17.5% in dermatology and ophthalmology, respectively), and stronger image-text retrieval, all while using 10x less compute.

Despite strong performance, LMMs are not directly suited for foundational discriminative vision-language tasks (i.e., tasks requiring discrete label predictions) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for discriminative tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative models. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach for finding features in the model's latent space to more effectively leverage LMMs for discriminative tasks. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 1\% of the heads) in LMMs as strong features for VL tasks. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of discriminative tasks. Our experiments also imply that SAVs can scale in performance with additional examples and generalize to similar tasks, establishing SAVs as both effective and robust multimodal feature representations.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634. Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.

However, existing RS MLLMs lack the pixel-level dialogue capability, which involves responding to user instructions with segmentation masks for specific instances. In this paper, we propose GeoPix, a RS MLLM that extends image understanding capabilities to the pixel level. This is achieved by equipping the MLLM with a mask predictor, which transforms visual features from the vision encoder into masks conditioned on the LLM's segmentation token embeddings. To facilitate the segmentation of multi-scale objects in RS imagery, a class-wise learnable memory module is integrated into the mask predictor to capture and store class-wise geo-context at the instance level across the entire dataset. In addition, to address the absence of large-scale datasets for training pixel-level RS MLLMs, we construct the GeoPixInstruct dataset, comprising 65,463 images and 140,412 instances, with each instance annotated with text descriptions, bounding boxes, and masks. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training strategy to balance the distinct requirements of text generation and masks prediction in multi-modal multi-task optimization. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and superiority of GeoPix in pixel-level segmentation tasks, while also maintaining competitive performance in image- and region-level benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, they often encounter difficulty while solving complex physics problems that require arithmetic calculation and a good understanding of concepts. Moreover, many physics problems include images that contain important details required to understand the problem's context. We propose an LMM-based chatbot to answer multimodal physics MCQs. For domain adaptation, we utilize the MM-PhyQA dataset comprising Indian high school-level multimodal physics problems. To improve the LMM's performance, we experiment with two techniques, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and Image Captioning. In image captioning, we add a detailed explanation of the diagram in each image, minimizing hallucinations and image processing errors. We further explore the integration of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methodology inspired by the ranking approach in RLHF to enhance the human-like problem-solving abilities of the models. The RLHF approach incorporates human feedback into the learning process of LLMs, improving the model's problem-solving skills, truthfulness, and reasoning capabilities, minimizing the hallucinations in the answers, and improving the quality instead of using vanilla-supervised fine-tuned models. We employ the LLaVA open-source model to answer multimodal physics MCQs and compare the performance with and without using RLHF.</p></details> |  | None |

As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors. Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research.</p></details> |  | None |

The typical feedback at training time, i.e., preferences of choice given two samples, does not naturally transfer to the inference phase. We introduce a novel type of feedback -- caption reformulations -- and train models to mimic reformulation feedback based on human annotations. Our method does not require training the image captioning model itself, thereby demanding substantially less computational effort. We experiment with two types of reformulation feedback: first, we collect a dataset of human reformulations that correct errors in the generated captions. We find that incorporating reformulation models trained on this data into the inference phase of existing image captioning models results in improved captions, especially when the original captions are of low quality. We apply our method to non-English image captioning, a domain where robust models are less prevalent, and gain substantial improvement. Second, we apply reformulations to style transfer. Quantitative evaluations reveal state-of-the-art performance on German image captioning and English style transfer, while human validation with a detailed comparative framework exposes the specific axes of improvement.</p></details> |  | None |

While reference-free evaluation metrics have been proposed, most focus on cross-modal evaluation between captions and images. Recent research has revealed that the modality gap generally exists in the representation of contrastive learning-based multi-modal systems, undermining the reliability of cross-modality metrics like CLIPScore. In this paper, we propose CAMScore, a cyclic reference-free automatic evaluation metric for image captioning models. To circumvent the aforementioned modality gap, CAMScore utilizes a text-to-image model to generate images from captions and subsequently evaluates these generated images against the original images. Furthermore, to provide fine-grained information for a more comprehensive evaluation, we design a three-level evaluation framework for CAMScore that encompasses pixel-level, semantic-level, and objective-level perspectives. Extensive experiment results across multiple benchmark datasets show that CAMScore achieves a superior correlation with human judgments compared to existing reference-based and reference-free metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework.</p></details> |  | None |

MLLMs demonstrate capabilities such as generating image captions and answering image-based questions, bridging the gap towards real-world human-computer interactions and hinting at a potential pathway to artificial general intelligence. However, MLLMs still face challenges in addressing the semantic gap in multimodal data, which may lead to erroneous outputs, posing potential risks to society. Selecting the appropriate modality alignment method is crucial, as improper methods might require more parameters without significant performance improvements. This paper aims to explore modality alignment methods for LLMs and their current capabilities. Implementing effective modality alignment can help LLMs address environmental issues and enhance accessibility. The study surveys existing modality alignment methods for MLLMs, categorizing them into four groups: (1) Multimodal Converter, which transforms data into a format that LLMs can understand; (2) Multimodal Perceiver, which improves how LLMs percieve different types of data; (3) Tool Learning, which leverages external tools to convert data into a common format, usually text; and (4) Data-Driven Method, which teaches LLMs to understand specific data types within datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by TKDE | None |

Since fake news can belong to different domains like politics, sports, etc. with their unique characteristics, inference on a test image-caption pair is contingent on how well the model has been trained on similar data. Since training individual models for each domain is not practical, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt tuning using Out-of-domain data), which can exploit out-of-domain data during training to improve fake news detection of all desired domains simultaneously. First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages training samples of all the available domains based on the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NewsCLIPpings and VERITE benchmarks demonstrate that DPOD achieves state of-the-art performance for this challenging task.

Towards systematic study of such issues, we introduce a synthetic framework for assessing the ability of VLMs to perform algorithmic visual reasoning (AVR), comprising three tasks: Table Readout, Grid Navigation, and Visual Analogy. Each has two levels of difficulty, SIMPLE and HARD, and even the SIMPLE versions are difficult for frontier VLMs. We seek strategies for training on the SIMPLE version of the tasks that improve performance on the corresponding HARD task, i.e., S2H generalization. This synthetic framework, where each task also has a text-only version, allows a quantification of the modality imbalance, and how it is impacted by training strategy. Ablations highlight the importance of explicit image-to-text conversion in promoting S2H generalization when using auto-regressive training. We also report results of mechanistic study of this phenomenon, including a measure of gradient alignment that seems to identify training strategies that promote better S2H generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

The remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion model presents the potential to resolve this task by employing synthetic image-caption pairs generated by this pre-trained prior. Nonetheless, the defective details in the salient regions of the synthetic images introduce semantic misalignment between the synthetic image and text, leading to compromised results. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Patch-wise Cross-modal feature Mix-up (PCM) mechanism to adaptively mitigate the unfaithful contents in a fine-grained manner during training, which can be integrated into most of encoder-decoder frameworks, introducing our PCM-Net. Specifically, for each input image, salient visual concepts in the image are first detected considering the image-text similarity in CLIP space. Next, the patch-wise visual features of the input image are selectively fused with the textual features of the salient visual concepts, leading to a mixed-up feature map with less defective content. Finally, a visual-semantic encoder is exploited to refine the derived feature map, which is further incorporated into the sentence decoder for caption generation. Additionally, to facilitate the model training with synthetic data, a novel CLIP-weighted cross-entropy loss is devised to prioritize the high-quality image-text pairs over the low-quality counterparts. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PCM-Net compared with state-of-the-art VLMs-based approaches. It is noteworthy that our PCM-Net ranks first in both in-domain and cross-domain zero-shot image captioning.

They can generate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions of images. However, they still face challenges in accurately identifying and counting objects and determining their spatial locations, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping or small objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which introduces structured scene graphs to enhance object recognition, relationship identification, and spatial understanding within images. Our framework improves the MLLM's capacity to handle tasks requiring precise visual descriptions, especially in scenarios with challenging perspectives, such as aerial views or scenes with dense object arrangements. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the VG-150 dataset that focuses on first-person visual understanding and the AUG dataset that involves aerial imagery. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing MLLMs in VQA tasks, which stands out in recognizing, localizing, and quantifying objects in different spatial contexts and provides more accurate visual descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

To generate training data, we perform human annotation where annotators start with the existing alt-text and re-align it to the image content in multiple rounds, consequently constructing captions with rich visual concepts. This differs from prior work that carries out human annotation as a one-time description task solely based on images and annotator knowledge. We train a captioner on this data that generalizes the process of re-aligning alt-texts at scale. Our results show our Altogether approach leads to richer image captions that also improve text-to-image generation and zero-shot image classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by EMNLP 2024; Meta CLIP 1.2 Data Engine</p></details> | None |
| **[ErgoChat: a Visual Query System for the Ergonomic Risk Assessment of Construction Workers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19954v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the construction sector, workers often endure prolonged periods of high-intensity physical work and prolonged use of tools, resulting in injuries and illnesses primarily linked to postural ergonomic risks, a longstanding predominant health concern. To mitigate these risks, researchers have applied various technological methods to identify the ergonomic risks that construction workers face. However, traditional ergonomic risk assessment (ERA) techniques do not offer interactive feedback. The rapidly developing vision-language models (VLMs), capable of generating textual descriptions or answering questions about ergonomic risks based on image inputs, have not yet received widespread attention. This research introduces an interactive visual query system tailored to assess the postural ergonomic risks of construction workers. The system's capabilities include visual question answering (VQA), which responds to visual queries regarding workers' exposure to postural ergonomic risks, and image captioning (IC), which generates textual descriptions of these risks from images. Additionally, this study proposes a dataset designed for training and testing such methodologies. Systematic testing indicates that the VQA functionality delivers an accuracy of 96.5%. Moreover, evaluations using nine metrics for IC and assessments from human experts indicate that the proposed approach surpasses the performance of a method using the same architecture trained solely on generic datasets. This study sets a new direction for future developments in interactive ERA using generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures | None |

Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization. Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications.

Our analysis reveals that existing hallucination detection methods struggle with detailed captions. We attribute this to the increasing reliance of MLLMs on their generated text, rather than the input image, as the sequence length grows. To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be released publicly upon publication, fostering further research and innovation in this field.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most models rely on text-based instructions, limiting their effectiveness in human-machine interactions. Moreover, the quality of language models depends on reasoning and prompting techniques, such as COT, which remain underexplored when using speech instructions. To address these challenges, we propose SilVar, a novel end-to-end multimodal model that uses speech instructions for reasoning in visual question answering. In addition, we investigate reasoning techniques with levels including conversational, simple, and complex speech instruction. SilVar is built upon CLIP, Whisper, and LLaMA 3.1-8B, enabling intuitive interactions by allowing users to provide verbal or text instructions. To this end, we introduce a dataset designed to challenge models with speech-based reasoning tasks for object localization. This dataset enhances the model ability to process and explain visual scenes from spoken input, moving beyond object recognition to reasoning-based interactions. The experiments show that SilVar achieves SOTA performance on the MMMU and ScienceQA benchmarks despite the challenge of speech-based instructions. We believe SilVar will inspire next-generation multimodal reasoning models, toward expert artificial general intelligence. Our code and dataset are available here.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

However, these models often struggle with generating anatomically accurate representations of human hands. The resulting images frequently exhibit issues such as incorrect numbers of fingers, unnatural twisting or interlacing of fingers, or blurred and indistinct hands. These issues stem from the inherent complexity of hand structures and the difficulty in aligning textual descriptions with precise visual depictions of hands. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named Hand1000 that enables the generation of realistic hand images with target gesture using only 1,000 training samples. The training of Hand1000 is divided into three stages with the first stage aiming to enhance the model's understanding of hand anatomy by using a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to extract gesture representation. The second stage further optimizes text embedding by incorporating the extracted hand gesture representation, to improve alignment between the textual descriptions and the generated hand images. The third stage utilizes the optimized embedding to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to generate realistic hand images. In addition, we construct the first publicly available dataset specifically designed for text-to-hand image generation. Based on the existing hand gesture recognition dataset, we adopt advanced image captioning models and LLaMA3 to generate high-quality textual descriptions enriched with detailed gesture information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hand1000 significantly outperforms existing models in producing anatomically correct hand images while faithfully representing other details in the text, such as faces, clothing, and colors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

Self-Instruct provides an annotation-free way for generating instruction data, but its quality is poor, as multimodal alignment remains a hurdle even for the largest models. In this work, we propose LLaVAR-2, to enhance multimodal alignment for text-rich images through hybrid instruction generation between human annotators and large language models. Specifically, it involves detailed image captions from human annotators, followed by the use of these annotations in tailored text prompts for GPT-4o to curate a dataset. It also implements several mechanisms to filter out low-quality data, and the resulting dataset comprises 424k high-quality pairs of instructions. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on this dataset exhibit impressive enhancements over those trained with self-instruct data.</p></details> | COLING 2025 | None |
| **[Reframing Image Difference Captioning with BLIP2IDC and Synthetic Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15939v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of the generative models quality during the past years enabled the generation of edited variations of images at an important scale. To counter the harmful effects of such technology, the Image Difference Captioning (IDC) task aims to describe the differences between two images. While this task is successfully handled for simple 3D rendered images, it struggles on real-world images. The reason is twofold: the training data-scarcity, and the difficulty to capture fine-grained differences between complex images. To address those issues, we propose in this paper a simple yet effective framework to both adapt existing image captioning models to the IDC task and augment IDC datasets. We introduce BLIP2IDC, an adaptation of BLIP2 to the IDC task at low computational cost, and show it outperforms two-streams approaches by a significant margin on real-world IDC datasets. We also propose to use synthetic augmentation to improve the performance of IDC models in an agnostic fashion. We show that our synthetic augmentation strategy provides high quality data, leading to a challenging new dataset well-suited for IDC named Syned1.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional image captioning methods often overlook the preferences and characteristics of users. Personalized image captioning solves this problem by incorporating user prior knowledge into the model, such as writing styles and preferred vocabularies. Most existing methods emphasize the user context fusion process by memory networks or transformers. However, these methods ignore the distinct domains of each dataset. Therefore, they need to update the entire caption model parameters when meeting new samples, which is time-consuming and calculation-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel personalized image captioning framework that leverages user context to consider personality factors. Additionally, our framework utilizes the prefix-tuning paradigm to extract knowledge from a frozen large language model, reducing the gap between different language domains. Specifically, we employ CLIP to extract the visual features of an image and align the semantic space using a query-guided mapping network. By incorporating the transformer layer, we merge the visual features with the user's contextual prior knowledge to generate informative prefixes. Moreover, we employ GPT-2 as the frozen large language model. With a small number of parameters to be trained, our model performs efficiently and effectively. Our model outperforms existing baseline models on Instagram and YFCC100M datasets across five evaluation metrics, demonstrating its superiority, including twofold improvements in metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr.</p></details> |  | None |

A promising solution is the self-evolution strategy, where models are iteratively trained on data they generate. However, current techniques still rely on human- or GPT-annotated data and sometimes require additional models or ground truth answers. To address these issues, we propose a novel multimodal self-evolution framework that enables the model to autonomously generate high-quality questions and answers using only unannotated images. First, we implement an image-driven self-questioning mechanism, allowing the model to create and evaluate questions based on image content, regenerating them if they are irrelevant or unanswerable. This sets a strong foundation for answer generation. Second, we introduce an answer self-enhancement technique, starting with image captioning to improve answer quality. We also use corrupted images to generate rejected answers, forming distinct preference pairs for optimization. Finally, we incorporate an image content alignment loss function alongside Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss to reduce hallucinations, ensuring the model focuses on image content. Experiments show that our framework performs competitively with methods using external information, offering a more efficient and scalable approach to MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

We introduce a unique procedure called Mixing Visual Concepts (MVC) where we create novel text embeddings from image captions. The MVC enables us to generate multiple images which are diverse and yet similar to the real data enabling us to perform effective dataset augmentation. We perform comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations with the proposed dataset augmentation approach showcasing both coarse-grained and finegrained changes in generated images.

Existing supervised methods depend on datasets containing triplets of input image, edited image, and edit instruction. These are generated by either existing editing methods or human-annotations, which introduce biases and limit their generalization ability. Our method addresses these challenges by introducing a novel editing mechanism called Cycle Edit Consistency (CEC), which applies forward and backward edits in one training step and enforces consistency in image and attention spaces. This allows us to bypass the need for ground-truth edited images and unlock training for the first time on datasets comprising either real image-caption pairs or image-caption-edit triplets. We empirically show that our unsupervised technique performs better across a broader range of edits with high fidelity and precision. By eliminating the need for pre-existing datasets of triplets, reducing biases associated with supervised methods, and proposing CEC, our work represents a significant advancement in unblocking scaling of instruction-based image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://enis.dev/uip2p/</p></details> | None |

Here, the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion models, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly, for text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth estimation, and image super-resolution. We hope this paper contributes to accelerating progress in cross-modal media generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cross-flow.github.io/</p></details> | None |

VHM is built on a large-scale remote sensing image-text dataset with rich-content captions (VersaD), and an honest instruction dataset comprising both factual and deceptive questions (HnstD). Unlike prevailing remote sensing image-text datasets, in which image captions focus on a few prominent objects and their relationships, VersaD captions provide detailed information about image properties, object attributes, and the overall scene. This comprehensive captioning enables VHM to thoroughly understand remote sensing images and perform diverse remote sensing tasks. Moreover, different from existing remote sensing instruction datasets that only include factual questions, HnstD contains additional deceptive questions stemming from the non-existence of objects. This feature prevents VHM from producing affirmative answers to nonsense queries, thereby ensuring its honesty. In our experiments, VHM significantly outperforms various vision language models on common tasks of scene classification, visual question answering, and visual grounding.

However, recent studies have revealed that VLMs are vulnerable to image-based adversarial attacks, particularly targeted adversarial images that manipulate the model to generate harmful content specified by the adversary. Current attack methods rely on predefined target labels to create targeted adversarial attacks, which limits their scalability and applicability for large-scale robustness evaluations. In this paper, we propose AnyAttack, a self-supervised framework that generates targeted adversarial images for VLMs without label supervision, allowing any image to serve as a target for the attack. Our framework employs the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, with the adversarial noise generator pre-trained on the large-scale LAION-400M dataset. This large-scale pre-training endows our method with powerful transferability across a wide range of VLMs. Extensive experiments on five mainstream open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) across three multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, multimodal classification, and image captioning) demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. Additionally, we successfully transfer AnyAttack to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini, Claude Sonnet, Microsoft Copilot and OpenAI GPT. These results reveal an unprecedented risk to VLMs, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures.</p></details> |  | None |

These models have opened new avenues for developing unified biomedical assistants capable of analyzing biomedical images, answering complex questions about them, and predicting the impact of medical procedures on a patient's health.

With 1.47 million instances, MedMax encompasses a diverse range of tasks, including multimodal content generation (interleaved image-text data), biomedical image captioning and generation, visual chatting, and report understanding. These tasks span diverse medical domains such as radiology and histopathology. Subsequently, we fine-tune a mixed-modal foundation model on the MedMax dataset, achieving significant performance improvements: a 26% gain over the Chameleon model and an 18.3% improvement over GPT-4o across 12 downstream biomedical visual question-answering tasks.

However, while these models excel at generating factual content, their ability to generate and evaluate texts reflecting perspectives on the same image, depending on the context, has not been sufficiently explored. To address this, we propose IRR: Image Review Rank, a novel evaluation framework designed to assess critic review texts from multiple perspectives. IRR evaluates LVLMs by measuring how closely their judgments align with human interpretations. We validate it using a dataset of images from 15 categories, each with five critic review texts and annotated rankings in both English and Japanese, totaling over 2,000 data instances. The datasets are available at https://hf.co/datasets/naist-nlp/Wiki-ImageReview1.0. Our results indicate that, although LVLMs exhibited consistent performance across languages, their correlation with human annotations was insufficient, highlighting the need for further advancements. These findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation methods and the need for approaches that better capture human reasoning in Vision & Language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, Accepted at COLING25</p></details> | None |

With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal \textbf{Punch}line comprehension \textbf{Bench}mark, named \textbf{PunchBench}, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones. SC-CoQ effectively enhances the performance of various MLLMs on PunchBench, surpassing in-context learning and chain-of-thought.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UnMA-CapSumT: Unified and Multi-Head Attention-driven Caption Summarization Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11836v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning is the generation of natural language descriptions of images which have increased immense popularity in the recent past. With this different deep-learning techniques are devised for the development of factual and stylized image captioning models. Previous models focused more on the generation of factual and stylized captions separately providing more than one caption for a single image. The descriptions generated from these suffer from out-of-vocabulary and repetition issues. To the best of our knowledge, no such work exists that provided a description that integrates different captioning methods to describe the contents of an image with factual and stylized (romantic and humorous) elements. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel Unified Attention and Multi-Head Attention-driven Caption Summarization Transformer (UnMA-CapSumT) based Captioning Framework. It utilizes both factual captions and stylized captions generated by the Modified Adaptive Attention-based factual image captioning model (MAA-FIC) and Style Factored Bi-LSTM with attention (SF-Bi-ALSTM) driven stylized image captioning model respectively. SF-Bi-ALSTM-based stylized IC model generates two prominent styles of expression- {romance, and humor}. The proposed summarizer UnMHA-ST combines both factual and stylized descriptions of an input image to generate styled rich coherent summarized captions. The proposed UnMHA-ST transformer learns and summarizes different linguistic styles efficiently by incorporating proposed word embedding fastText with Attention Word Embedding (fTA-WE) and pointer-generator network with coverage mechanism concept to solve the out-of-vocabulary issues and repetition problem. Extensive experiments are conducted on Flickr8K and a subset of FlickrStyle10K with supporting ablation studies to prove the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Optimizing Vision-Language Interactions Through Decoder-Only Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10758v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as key enablers for multimodal tasks, but their reliance on separate visual encoders introduces challenges in efficiency, scalability, and modality alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MUDAIF (Multimodal Unified Decoder with Adaptive Input Fusion), a decoder-only vision-language model that seamlessly integrates visual and textual inputs through a novel Vision-Token Adapter (VTA) and adaptive co-attention mechanism. By eliminating the need for a visual encoder, MUDAIF achieves enhanced efficiency, flexibility, and cross-modal understanding. Trained on a large-scale dataset of 45M image-text pairs, MUDAIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, including VQA, image captioning, and multimodal reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses and human evaluations demonstrate MUDAIF's robustness, generalization capabilities, and practical usability, establishing it as a new standard in encoder-free vision-language models.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Vision-Language Models Represent Darker-Skinned Black Individuals as More Homogeneous than Lighter-Skinned Black Individuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09668v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities with image processing, enabling tasks like image captioning and text-to-image generation. Yet concerns persist about their potential to amplify human-like biases, including skin tone bias. Skin tone bias, where darker-skinned individuals face more negative stereotyping than lighter-skinned individuals, is well-documented in the social sciences but remains under-explored in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in VLMs. While well-documented in the social sciences, this bias remains under-explored in AI, particularly in VLMs. Using the GAN Face Database, we sampled computer-generated images of Black American men and women, controlling for skin tone variations while keeping other features constant. We then asked VLMs to write stories about these faces and compared the homogeneity of the generated stories. Stories generated by VLMs about darker-skinned Black individuals were more homogeneous than those about lighter-skinned individuals in three of four models, and Black women were consistently represented more homogeneously than Black men across all models. Interaction effects revealed a greater impact of skin tone on women in two VLMs, while the other two showed nonsignificant results, reflecting known stereotyping patterns. These findings underscore the propagation of biases from single-modality AI systems to multimodal models and highlight the need for further research to address intersectional biases in AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Causal Graphical Models for Vision-Language Compositional Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09353v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a "bag of words". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models via Directed Scene Graph for Comprehensive Image Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08614v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating detailed captions comprehending text-rich visual content in images has received growing attention for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, few studies have developed benchmarks specifically tailored for detailed captions to measure their accuracy and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we introduce a detailed caption benchmark, termed as CompreCap, to evaluate the visual context from a directed scene graph view. Concretely, we first manually segment the image into semantically meaningful regions (i.e., semantic segmentation mask) according to common-object vocabulary, while also distinguishing attributes of objects within all those regions. Then directional relation labels of these objects are annotated to compose a directed scene graph that can well encode rich compositional information of the image. Based on our directed scene graph, we develop a pipeline to assess the generated detailed captions from LVLMs on multiple levels, including the object-level coverage, the accuracy of attribute descriptions, the score of key relationships, etc. Experimental results on the CompreCap dataset confirm that our evaluation method aligns closely with human evaluation scores across LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures.

| **[AICAttack: Adversarial Image Captioning Attack with Attention-Based Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11940v4)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning research have shown remarkable achievements across many tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). At the intersection of CV and NLP is the problem of image captioning, where the related models' robustness against adversarial attacks has not been well studied. This paper presents a novel adversarial attack strategy, AICAttack (Attention-based Image Captioning Attack), designed to attack image captioning models through subtle perturbations on images. Operating within a black-box attack scenario, our algorithm requires no access to the target model's architecture, parameters, or gradient information. We introduce an attention-based candidate selection mechanism that identifies the optimal pixels to attack, followed by a customised differential evolution method to optimise the perturbations of pixels' RGB values. We demonstrate AICAttack's effectiveness through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets against multiple victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current leading-edge techniques by achieving consistently higher attack success rates.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Seeing Syntax: Uncovering Syntactic Learning Limitations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08111v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs), serve as foundation models for multi-modal applications such as image captioning and text-to-image generation. Recent studies have highlighted limitations in VLM text encoders, particularly in areas like compositionality and semantic understanding, though the underlying reasons for these limitations remain unclear. In this work, we aim to address this gap by analyzing the syntactic information, one of the fundamental linguistic properties, encoded by the text encoders of VLMs. We perform a thorough analysis comparing VLMs with different objective functions, parameter size and training data size, and with uni-modal language models (ULMs) in their ability to encode syntactic knowledge. Our findings suggest that ULM text encoders acquire syntactic information more effectively than those in VLMs. The syntactic information learned by VLM text encoders is shaped primarily by the pre-training objective, which plays a more crucial role than other factors such as model architecture, model size, or the volume of pre-training data. Models exhibit different layer-wise trends where CLIP performance dropped across layers while for other models, middle layers are rich in encoding syntactic knowledge.</p></details> |  | None |
