| **[Neural Attention: A Novel Mechanism for Enhanced Expressive Power in Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17206v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models typically calculate attention matrices using dot products, which have limitations when capturing nonlinear relationships between embedding vectors. We propose Neural Attention, a technique that replaces dot products with feed-forward networks, enabling a more expressive representation of relationships between tokens. This approach modifies only the attention matrix calculation while preserving the matrix dimensions, making it easily adaptable to existing transformer-based architectures. We provide a detailed mathematical justification for why Neural Attention increases representational capacity and conduct controlled experiments to validate this claim. When comparing Neural Attention and Dot-Product Attention, NLP experiments on WikiText-103 show a reduction in perplexity of over 5 percent. Similarly, experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show comparable improvements for image classification tasks. While Neural Attention introduces higher computational demands, we develop techniques to mitigate these challenges, ensuring practical usability without sacrificing the increased expressivity it provides. This work establishes Neural Attention as an effective means of enhancing the predictive capabilities of transformer models across a variety of applications.</p></details> |  | None |

A key feature of the multi-label setting is that an image often has several labels, which typically refer to objects appearing in different regions of the image. When estimating label prototypes, in a metric-based setting, it is thus important to determine which regions are relevant for which labels, but the limited amount of training data and the noisy nature of local features make this highly challenging. As a solution, we propose a strategy in which label prototypes are gradually refined. First, we initialize the prototypes using word embeddings, which allows us to leverage prior knowledge about the meaning of the labels. Second, taking advantage of these initial prototypes, we then use a Loss Change Measurement (LCM) strategy to select the local features from the training images (i.e. the support set) that are most likely to be representative of a given label. Third, we construct the final prototype of the label by aggregating these representative local features using a multi-modal cross-interaction mechanism, which again relies on the initial word embedding-based prototypes. Experiments on COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, and iMaterialist show that our model substantially improves the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Tr...</summary><p>In Transactions on Multimedia Computing Communications and Applications. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2112.01037</p></details> | None |
| **[Disentangling Visual Transformers: Patch-level Interpretability for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17196v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual transformers have achieved remarkable performance in image classification tasks, but this performance gain has come at the cost of interpretability. One of the main obstacles to the interpretation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which mixes visual information across the whole image in a complex way. In this paper, we propose Hindered Transformer (HiT), a novel interpretable by design architecture inspired by visual transformers. Our proposed architecture rethinks the design of transformers to better disentangle patch influences at the classification stage. Ultimately, HiT can be interpreted as a linear combination of patch-level information. We show that the advantages of our approach in terms of explicability come with a reasonable trade-off in performance, making it an attractive alternative for applications where interpretability is paramount.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DebugAgent: Efficient and Interpretable Error Slice Discovery for Comprehensive Model Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16751v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant success of deep learning models in computer vision, they often exhibit systematic failures on specific data subsets, known as error slices. Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DebugAgent, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. DebugAgent first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, DebugAgent extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that DebugAgent not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Which Transformer to Favor: A Comparative Analysis of Efficiency in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09372v4)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-attention in Transformers comes with a high computational cost because of their quadratic computational complexity, but their effectiveness in addressing problems in language and vision has sparked extensive research aimed at enhancing their efficiency. However, diverse experimental conditions, spanning multiple input domains, prevent a fair comparison based solely on reported results, posing challenges for model selection. To address this gap in comparability, we perform a large-scale benchmark of more than 45 models for image classification, evaluating key efficiency aspects, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage. Our benchmark provides a standardized baseline for efficiency-oriented transformers. We analyze the results based on the Pareto front -- the boundary of optimal models. Surprisingly, despite claims of other models being more efficient, ViT remains Pareto optimal across multiple metrics. We observe that hybrid attention-CNN models exhibit remarkable inference memory- and parameter-efficiency. Moreover, our benchmark shows that using a larger model in general is more efficient than using higher resolution images. Thanks to our holistic evaluation, we provide a centralized resource for practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting or developing efficient transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: n...</summary><p>v3: new models, analysis of scaling behaviors; v4: WACV 2025 camera ready version, appendix added</p></details> | None |
| **[Make LoRA Great Again: Boosting LoRA with Adaptive Singular Values and Mixture-of-Experts Optimization Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16894v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs), its performance often falls short of Full Fine-Tuning (Full FT). Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose \underline{G}reat L\underline{o}R\underline{A} Mixture-of-Exper\underline{t} (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance. Experiments across 25 datasets, including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, image classification, and natural language generation, demonstrate GOAT's state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Transformer-in-Transformer Network Utilizing Knowledge Distillation for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16762v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel knowledge distillation neural architecture leveraging efficient transformer networks for effective image classification. Natural images display intricate arrangements encompassing numerous extraneous elements. Vision transformers utilize localized patches to compute attention. However, exclusive dependence on patch segmentation proves inadequate in sufficiently encompassing the comprehensive nature of the image. To address this issue, we have proposed an inner-outer transformer-based architecture, which gives attention to the global and local aspects of the image. Moreover, The training of transformer models poses significant challenges due to their demanding resource, time, and data requirements. To tackle this, we integrate knowledge distillation into the architecture, enabling efficient learning. Leveraging insights from a larger teacher model, our approach enhances learning efficiency and effectiveness. Significantly, the transformer-in-transformer network acquires lightweight characteristics by means of distillation conducted within the feature extraction layer. Our featured network's robustness is established through substantial experimentation on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, demonstrating commendable top-1 and top-5 accuracy. The conducted ablative analysis comprehensively validates the effectiveness of the chosen parameters and settings, showcasing their superiority against contemporary methodologies. Remarkably, the proposed Transformer-in-Transformer Network (TITN) model achieves impressive performance milestones across various datasets: securing the highest top-1 accuracy of 74.71% and a top-5 accuracy of 92.28% for the CIFAR100 dataset, attaining an unparalleled top-1 accuracy of 92.03% and top-5 accuracy of 99.80% for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and registering an exceptional top-1 accuracy of 99.56% for the MNIST dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AUKT: Adaptive Uncertainty-Guided Knowledge Transfer with Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16736v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge transfer between teacher and student models has proven effective across various machine learning applications. However, challenges arise when the teacher's predictions are noisy, or the data domain during student training shifts from the teacher's pretraining data. In such scenarios, blindly relying on the teacher's predictions can lead to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and universal framework, Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Knowledge Transfer ($\textbf{AUKT}$), which leverages Conformal Prediction (CP) to dynamically adjust the student's reliance on the teacher's guidance based on the teacher's prediction uncertainty. CP is a distribution-free, model-agnostic approach that provides reliable prediction sets with statistical coverage guarantees and minimal computational overhead. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the risk of learning undesirable or incorrect knowledge. We validate the proposed framework across diverse applications, including image classification, imitation-guided reinforcement learning, and autonomous driving. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that our approach improves performance, robustness and transferability, offering a promising direction for enhanced knowledge transfer in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MOB-GCN: A Novel Multiscale Object-Based Graph Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16289v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel multiscale object-based graph neural network called MOB-GCN for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The central aim of this study is to enhance feature extraction and classification performance by utilizing multiscale object-based image analysis (OBIA). Traditional pixel-based methods often suffer from low accuracy and speckle noise, while single-scale OBIA approaches may overlook crucial information of image objects at different levels of detail. MOB-GCN overcomes these challenges by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales, leveraging the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture to capture both fine-grained and global spatial patterns. MOB-GCN addresses this issue by extracting and integrating features from multiple segmentation scales to improve classification results using the Multiresolution Graph Network (MGN) architecture that can model fine-grained and global spatial patterns. By constructing a dynamic multiscale graph hierarchy, MOB-GCN offers a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate details and global context of HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that MOB-GCN consistently outperforms single-scale graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise reduction, particularly when labeled data is limited. The implementation of MOB-GCN is publicly available at https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/HySonLab/MultiscaleHSI) |
| **[A Multi-Scale Isolation Forest Approach for Real-Time Detection and Filtering of FGSM Adversarial Attacks in Video Streams of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16044v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, particularly in fields such as image classification. However, DNNs are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations are introduced to input images, leading to erroneous model outputs. In today's digital era, ensuring the security and integrity of images processed by DNNs is of critical importance. One of the most prominent adversarial attack methods is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which perturbs images in the direction of the loss gradient to deceive the model. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting and filtering FGSM adversarial attacks in image processing tasks. Our proposed method evaluates 10,000 images, each subjected to five different levels of perturbation, characterized by $\epsilon$ values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2. These perturbations are applied in the direction of the loss gradient. We demonstrate that our approach effectively filters adversarially perturbed images, mitigating the impact of FGSM attacks. The method is implemented in Python, and the source code is publicly available on GitHub for reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Directional Gradient Projection for Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15895v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Optimizing Estimators of Squared Calibration Errors in Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07014v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a mean-squared error-based risk that enables the comparison and optimization of estimators of squared calibration errors in practical settings. Improving the calibration of classifiers is crucial for enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of machine learning models, especially in sensitive decision-making scenarios. Although various calibration (error) estimators exist in the current literature, there is a lack of guidance on selecting the appropriate estimator and tuning its hyperparameters. By leveraging the bilinear structure of squared calibration errors, we reformulate calibration estimation as a regression problem with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input pairs. This reformulation allows us to quantify the performance of different estimators even for the most challenging calibration criterion, known as canonical calibration. Our approach advocates for a training-validation-testing pipeline when estimating a calibration error on an evaluation dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline by optimizing existing calibration estimators and comparing them with novel kernel ridge regression-based estimators on standard image classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at TMLR, see https://openreview.net/forum?id=BPDVZajOW5</p></details> | None |
| **[A Novel Riemannian Sparse Representation Learning Network for Polarimetric SAR Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15302v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is an effective end-to-end method for Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar(PolSAR) image classification, but it lacks the guidance of related mathematical principle and is essentially a black-box model. In addition, existing deep models learn features in Euclidean space, where PolSAR complex matrix is commonly converted into a complex-valued vector as the network input, distorting matrix structure and channel relationship. However, the complex covariance matrix is Hermitian positive definite (HPD), and resides on a Riemannian manifold instead of a Euclidean one. Existing methods cannot measure the geometric distance of HPD matrices and easily cause some misclassifications due to inappropriate Euclidean measures. To address these issues, we propose a novel Riemannian Sparse Representation Learning Network (SRSR CNN) for PolSAR images. Firstly, a superpixel-based Riemannian Sparse Representation (SRSR) model is designed to learn the sparse features with Riemannian metric. Then, the optimization procedure of the SRSR model is inferred and further unfolded into an SRSRnet, which can automatically learn the sparse coefficients and dictionary atoms. Furthermore, to learn contextual high-level features, a CNN-enhanced module is added to improve classification performance. The proposed network is a Sparse Representation (SR) guided deep learning model, which can directly utilize the covariance matrix as the network input, and utilize Riemannian metric to learn geometric structure and sparse features of complex matrices in Riemannian space. Experiments on three real PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in ensuring accurate edge details and correct region homogeneity for classification.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Quantum autoencoders for image classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15254v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical machine learning often struggles with complex, high-dimensional data. Quantum machine learning offers a potential solution, promising more efficient processing. While the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is suitable for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum-era hardware, its learning process relies heavily on classical computation. Future large-scale, gate-based quantum computers could unlock the full potential of quantum effects in machine learning. In contrast to QCNNs, quantum autoencoders (QAEs) leverage classical optimization solely for parameter tuning. Data compression and reconstruction are handled entirely within quantum circuits, enabling purely quantum-based feature extraction. This study introduces a novel image-classification approach using QAEs, achieving classification without requiring additional qubits compared with conventional QAE implementations. The quantum circuit structure significantly impacts classification accuracy. Unlike hybrid methods such as QCNN, QAE-based classification emphasizes quantum computation. Our experiments demonstrate high accuracy in a four-class classification task, evaluating various quantum-gate configurations to understand the impact of different parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) structures on classification performance. Our results reveal that specific ansatz structures achieve superior accuracy, and we provide an analysis of their effectiveness. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of conventional machine-learning methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters requiring optimization. These findings indicate that QAEs can serve as efficient classification models with fewer parameters and highlight the potential of utilizing quantum circuits for complete end-to-end learning, a departure from hybrid approaches such as QCNN.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Steganographic Embeddings as an Effective Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15245v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Steganography is a cryptographic technique that embeds secret information into an image, ensuring the hidden data remains undetectable to the human eye while preserving the image's original visual integrity. Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography achieves this by replacing the k least significant bits of an image with the k most significant bits of a secret image, maintaining the appearance of the original image while simultaneously encoding the essential elements of the hidden data. In this work, we shift away from conventional applications of steganography in deep learning and explore its potential from a new angle. We present experimental results on CIFAR-10 showing that LSB Steganography, when used as a data augmentation strategy for downstream computer vision tasks such as image classification, can significantly improve the training efficiency of deep neural networks. It can also act as an implicit, uniformly discretized piecewise linear approximation of color augmentations such as (brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation), without introducing additional training overhead through a new joint image training regime that disregards the need for tuning sensitive augmentation hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

| **[SCALES: Boost Binary Neural Network for Image Super-Resolution with Efficient Scalings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12270v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for image super-resolution (SR) have demonstrated superior performance. However, the large memory and computation consumption hinders their deployment on resource-constrained devices. Binary neural networks (BNNs), which quantize the floating point weights and activations to 1-bit can significantly reduce the cost. Although BNNs for image classification have made great progress these days, existing BNNs for SR still suffer from a large performance gap between the FP SR networks. To this end, we observe the activation distribution in SR networks and find much larger pixel-to-pixel, channel-to-channel, layer-to-layer, and image-to-image variation in the activation distribution than image classification networks. However, existing BNNs for SR fail to capture these variations that contain rich information for image reconstruction, leading to inferior performance. To address this problem, we propose SCALES, a binarization method for SR networks that consists of the layer-wise scaling factor, the spatial re-scaling method, and the channel-wise re-scaling method, capturing the layer-wise, pixel-wise, and channel-wise variations efficiently in an input-dependent manner. We evaluate our method across different network architectures and datasets. For CNN-based SR networks, our binarization method SCALES outperforms the prior art method by 0.2dB with fewer parameters and operations. With SCALES, we achieve the first accurate binary Transformer-based SR network, improving PSNR by more than 1dB compared to the baseline method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by DATE 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods treat human and AI as different entities when designing human-AI systems. However, as the decision capabilities of AI models become closer to human beings, it is necessary to build a uniform framework for capability modeling and integrating. In this study, we propose a general architecture for human-AI collaborative decision making, wherein we employ learnable capability vectors to represent the decision-making capabilities of both human experts and AI models. These capability vectors are utilized to determine the decision weights of multiple decision makers, taking into account the contextual information of each decision task. Our proposed architecture accommodates scenarios involving multiple human-AI decision makers with varying capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a learning-free approach to establish a baseline using global collaborative weights. Experiments on image classification and hate speech detection demonstrate that our proposed architecture significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in image classification and sentiment analysis, especially for the case with large non-expertise capability levels. Overall, our method provides an effective and robust collaborative decision-making approach that integrates diverse human/AI capabilities within a unified framework.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TransMamba: Fast Universal Architecture Adaption from Transformers to Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15130v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have been favored in both uni-modal and multi-modal foundation models for their flexible scalability in attention modules. Consequently, a number of pre-trained Transformer models, e.g., LLaVA, CLIP, and DEIT, are publicly available. Recent research has introduced subquadratic architectures like Mamba, which enables global awareness with linear complexity. Nevertheless, training specialized subquadratic architectures from scratch for certain tasks is both resource-intensive and time-consuming. As a motivator, we explore cross-architecture training to transfer the ready knowledge in existing Transformer models to alternative architecture Mamba, termed TransMamba. Our approach employs a two-stage strategy to expedite training new Mamba models, ensuring effectiveness in across uni-modal and cross-modal tasks. Concerning architecture disparities, we project the intermediate features into an aligned latent space before transferring knowledge. On top of that, a Weight Subcloning and Adaptive Bidirectional distillation method (WSAB) is introduced for knowledge transfer without limitations on varying layer counts. For cross-modal learning, we propose a cross-Mamba module that integrates language awareness into Mamba's visual features, enhancing the cross-modal interaction capabilities of Mamba architecture. Despite using less than 75% of the training data typically required for training from scratch, TransMamba boasts substantially stronger performance across various network architectures and downstream tasks, including image classification, visual question answering, and text-video retrieval. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

To advance research in such safety-critical systems, determining the precise contribution of spectral information to complex DNNs' output is needed. To address this, several saliency methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), have been proposed primarily for image classification. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding their reliability. In this paper, we address their limitations and propose an alternative approach by leveraging the data provided by activations and weights from relevant DNN layers to better capture the relationship between input features and predictions. The study aims to assess the superior performance of HSI compared to 3-channel and single-channel DNNs. We also address the influence of spectral signature normalization for enhancing DNN robustness in real-world driving conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bridging Sensor Gaps via Attention Gated Tuning for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12865v4)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-hungry HSI classification methods require high-quality labeled HSIs, which are often costly to obtain. This characteristic limits the performance potential of data-driven methods when dealing with limited annotated samples. Bridging the domain gap between data acquired from different sensors allows us to utilize abundant labeled data across sensors to break this bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Gated Tuning (AGT) strategy and a triplet-structured transformer model, Tri-Former, to address this issue. The AGT strategy serves as a bridge, allowing us to leverage existing labeled HSI datasets, even RGB datasets to enhance the performance on new HSI datasets with limited samples. Instead of inserting additional parameters inside the basic model, we train a lightweight auxiliary branch that takes intermediate features as input from the basic model and makes predictions. The proposed AGT resolves conflicts between heterogeneous and even cross-modal data by suppressing the disturbing information and enhances the useful information through a soft gate. Additionally, we introduce Tri-Former, a triplet-structured transformer with a spectral-spatial separation design that enhances parameter utilization and computational efficiency, enabling easier and flexible fine-tuning. Comparison experiments conducted on three representative HSI datasets captured by different sensors demonstrate the proposed Tri-Former achieves better performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Homologous, heterologous and cross-modal tuning experiments verified the effectiveness of the proposed AGT.

The method builds upon an adversarially-trained classifier, and learns to map its internal representation associated with a potentially perturbed input onto a distribution of tentative clean reconstructions. Multiple samples from such distribution are classified by the same adversarially-trained model, and a carefully chosen aggregation of its outputs finally constitutes the robust prediction of interest. Experimental evaluation by a well-established benchmark of strong adaptive attacks, across different image datasets, shows that CARSO is able to defend itself against adaptive end-to-end white-box attacks devised for stochastic defences. Paying a modest clean accuracy toll, our method improves by a significant margin the state-of-the-art for Cifar-10, Cifar-100, and TinyImageNet-200 $\ell_\infty$ robust classification accuracy against AutoAttack.

| **[Medical Image Classification with KAN-Integrated Transformers and Dilated Neighborhood Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13693v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance.

This approach is motivated by our theoretical and experimental analyses, which demonstrate that Layer Normalization (LN) can mitigate a limitation of existing activation functions regarding noise robustness. However, LN is known to be disadvantageous in CNNs due to its tendency to make activation outputs homogeneous. The proposed method is designed to be more robust than existing activation functions by reducing the upper bound of influence caused by input shifts without inheriting LN's limitation. We provide analyses and experiments showing that LayerAct functions exhibit superior robustness compared to ElementAct functions. Experimental results on three clean and noisy benchmark datasets for image classification tasks indicate that LayerAct functions outperform other activation functions in handling noisy datasets while achieving superior performance on clean datasets in most cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables except acknowledge, reference, and appendix.

| **[MaxSup: Overcoming Representation Collapse in Label Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15798v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to curb overconfidence in neural network predictions and enhance generalization. However, previous research shows that LS can force feature representations into excessively tight clusters, eroding intra-class distinctions. More recent findings suggest that LS also induces overconfidence in misclassifications, yet the precise mechanism remained unclear. In this work, we decompose the loss term introduced by LS, revealing two key components: (i) a regularization term that functions only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-enhancement term that emerges under misclassifications. This latter term compels the model to reinforce incorrect predictions with exaggerated certainty, further collapsing the feature space. To address these issues, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which uniformly applies the intended regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit instead of the ground-truth logit. Through feature analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Extensive experiments on image classification and downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.

In this work, we present first comprehensive QML study by benchmarking the MedMNIST-a diverse collection of medical imaging datasets on a 127-qubit real IBM quantum hardware, to evaluate the feasibility and performance of quantum models (without any classical neural networks) in practical applications. This study explore recent advancements in quantum computing such as device-aware quantum circuits, error suppression and mitigation for medical image classification. Our methodology comprised of three stages: preprocessing, generation of noise-resilient and hardware-efficient quantum circuits, optimizing/training of quantum circuits on classical hardware, and inference on real IBM quantum hardware. Firstly, we process all input images in the preprocessing stage to reduce the spatial dimension due to the quantum hardware limitations. We generate hardware-efficient quantum circuits using backend properties expressible to learn complex patterns for medical image classification. After classical optimization of QML models, we perform the inference on real quantum hardware. We also incorporates advanced error suppression and mitigation techniques in our QML workflow including dynamical decoupling (DD), gate twirling, and matrix-free measurement mitigation (M3) to mitigate the effects of noise and improve classification performance. The experimental results showcase the potential of quantum computing for medical imaging and establishes a benchmark for future advancements in QML applied to healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |

Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, and an image classification task from the WILDS repository.</p></details> |  | None |

More recently, a dynamic routing algorithm with capsules (groups of neurons) has shown state-of-the-art recognition performance. However, the behavior of such networks in the presence of a degrading signal (noise) is mostly unexplored. An analytical study on different network architectures toward noise robustness is essential for selecting the appropriate model in a specific application scenario. This paper presents an extensive performance analysis of six deep architectures for image classification on six most common image degradation models.

Their architecture consisting of several attention and feedforward blocks can model relations between elements of a sequence in parallel manner, which makes them very efficient to train and effective in sequence modeling. Even though they have shown strong performance in processing sequential data, the size of their parameters is considerably larger when compared to other architectures such as RNN and CNN based models. Therefore, several approaches have explored parameter sharing and recurrence in Transformer models to address their computational demands. However, such methods struggle to maintain high performance compared to the original transformer model. To address this challenge, we propose our novel approach, RingFormer, which employs one Transformer layer that processes input repeatedly in a circular, ring-like manner, while utilizing low-rank matrices to generate input-dependent level signals. This allows us to reduce the model parameters substantially while maintaining high performance in a variety of tasks such as translation and image classification, as validated in the experiments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DAMamba: Vision State Space Model with Dynamic Adaptive Scan](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12627v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently garnered significant attention in computer vision. However, due to the unique characteristics of image data, adapting SSMs from natural language processing to computer vision has not outperformed the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

Most efforts in recent vision research focus on measuring the model task performance using standardized benchmarks such as accuracy. However, limited work has sought to understand the perceptual difference between humans and machines. To fill this gap, this study first analyzes the statistical distributions of mistakes from the two sources and then explores how task difficulty level affects these distributions. We find that even when AI learns an excellent model from the training data, one that outperforms humans in overall accuracy, these AI models have significant and consistent differences from human perception. We demonstrate the importance of studying these differences with a simple human-AI teaming algorithm that outperforms humans alone, AI alone, or AI-AI teaming.</p></details> | AAAI 25 Oral | None |
| **[When Segmentation Meets Hyperspectral Image: New Paradigm for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12541v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a cornerstone of remote sensing, enabling precise material and land-cover identification through rich spectral information. While deep learning has driven significant progress in this task, small patch-based classifiers, which account for over 90% of the progress, face limitations: (1) the small patch (e.g., 7x7, 9x9)-based sampling approach considers a limited receptive field, resulting in insufficient spatial structural information critical for object-level identification and noise-like misclassifications even within uniform regions; (2) undefined optimal patch sizes lead to coarse label predictions, which degrade performance; and (3) a lack of multi-shape awareness around objects. To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from large-scale image segmentation techniques, which excel at handling object boundaries-a capability essential for semantic labeling in HSI classification. However, their application remains under-explored in this task due to (1) the prevailing notion that larger patch sizes degrade performance, (2) the extensive unlabeled regions in HSI groundtruth, and (3) the misalignment of input shapes between HSI data and segmentation models. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel paradigm and baseline, HSIseg, for HSI classification that leverages segmentation techniques combined with a novel Dynamic Shifted Regional Transformer (DSRT) to overcome these challenges. We also introduce an intuitive progressive learning framework with adaptive pseudo-labeling to iteratively incorporate unlabeled regions into the training process, thereby advancing the application of segmentation techniques. Additionally, we incorporate auxiliary data through multi-source data collaboration, promoting better feature interaction. Validated on five public HSI datasets, our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $50,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs to bridge the modalities given pre-trained unimodal encoders on ImageNet classification and misinformative news caption detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</p></details> |  | None |

A key challenge is catastrophic forgetting (CF), and most research efforts have been directed toward mitigating this issue. However, a significant gap remains between the accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art continual learning algorithms and the ideal or upper-bound accuracy achieved by training all tasks together jointly. This gap has hindered or even prevented the adoption of continual learning in applications, as accuracy is often of paramount importance. Recently, another challenge, termed inter-task class separation (ICS), was also identified, which spurred a theoretical study into principled approaches for solving continual learning. Further research has shown that by leveraging the theory and the power of large foundation models, it is now possible to achieve upper-bound accuracy, which has been empirically validated using both text and image classification datasets. Continual learning is now ready for real-life applications. This paper surveys the main research leading to this achievement, justifies the approach both intuitively and from neuroscience research, and discusses insights gained.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we investigate the impact of ImageNet-based pre-training on Vision Transformer (ViT) performance for OCT image classification across different dataset sizes. Our experiments cover four-category retinal pathologies (CNV, DME, Drusen, Normal). Results suggest that while pre-training can accelerate convergence and potentially offer better performance in smaller datasets, training from scratch may achieve comparable or even superior accuracy when sufficient OCT data is available. Our findings highlight the importance of matching domain characteristics in pre-training and call for further study on large-scale OCT-specific pre-training.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional learning algorithms for neural networks, however, suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., previously acquired skills are forgotten when a new task is learned. Instead of hand-crafting new algorithms for avoiding CF, we propose Automated Continual Learning (ACL) to train self-referential neural networks to metalearn their own in-context continual (meta)learning algorithms. ACL encodes continual learning (CL) desiderata -- good performance on both old and new tasks -- into its metalearning objectives. Our experiments demonstrate that ACL effectively resolves "in-context catastrophic forgetting," a problem that naive in-context learning algorithms suffer from; ACL-learned algorithms outperform both hand-crafted learning algorithms and popular meta-continual learning methods on the Split-MNIST benchmark in the replay-free setting, and enables continual learning of diverse tasks consisting of multiple standard image classification datasets. We also discuss the current limitations of in-context CL by comparing ACL with state-of-the-art CL methods that leverage pre-trained models. Overall, we bring several novel perspectives into the long-standing problem of CL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 02/2025.

By delving into the analysis of knock-on feature hierarchy, we find that incremental learning typically progresses from low\-level representations to higher\-level semantics, whereas forgetting tends to occur in the opposite direction\-starting from high-level semantics and moving down to low-level features. Building upon this, we propose to benchmark the knowledge swapping task with the strategy of \textit{Learning Before Forgetting}. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Most existing works employ sophisticated learning strategies and feature learning modules to alleviate this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel method called PrototypeFormer, exploring the relationships among category prototypes in the few-shot scenario. Specifically, we utilize a transformer architecture to build a prototype extraction module, aiming to extract class representations that are more discriminative for few-shot classification. Besides, during the model training process, we propose a contrastive learning-based optimization approach to optimize prototype features in few-shot learning scenarios. Despite its simplicity, our method performs remarkably well, with no bells and whistles. We have experimented with our approach on several popular few-shot image classification benchmark datasets, which shows that our method outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our method achieves 97.07\% and 90.88\% on 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 1-shot tasks of miniImageNet, which surpasses the state-of-the-art results with accuracy of 0.57\% and 6.84\%, respectively.

Our approach employs swift prompt selection to refine input data using a carefully provisioned model and introduces adaptive token merging (AToM) and layer dropping (ALD) for efficient prompt updates. AToM and ALD selectively skip data and model layers while preserving task-specific features during new-task learning. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets demonstrates REP's superior resource efficiency over state-of-the-art ViT- and CNN-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces the information theoretic principle of Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) to LLM fine-tuning for classification tasks, exploring its promise in two main ways: minimizing CMI to improve a model's standalone performance and maximizing CMI to enhance knowledge distillation (KD) for more capable student models. To apply CMI in LLM fine-tuning, we adapt the recently proposed CMI-constrained deep learning framework, which was initially developed for image classification, with some modification. By minimizing CMI during LLM fine-tuning, we achieve superior performance gains on 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to BERT. Additionally, maximizing CMI during the KD process results in significant performance improvements in 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to DistilBERT. These findings demonstrate CMI's adaptability for optimizing both standalone LLMs and student models, showcasing its potential as a robust framework for advancing LLM fine-tuning. Our work bridges the gap between information theory and LLM development, offering new insights for building high-performing language models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures | None |

This distribution disparity can lead to severe performance drops when the trained model is used in new data sets. Domain adaptation (DA) is a machine learning technique that aims to address this problem by reducing the differences between domains. This paper presents simulation-based algorithms of recent DA techniques, mainly related to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), where labels are available only in the source domain. Our study compares these techniques with public data sets and diverse characteristics, highlighting their respective strengths and drawbacks. For example, Safe Self-Refinement for Transformer-based DA (SSRT) achieved the highest accuracy (91.6\%) in the office-31 data set during our simulations, however, the accuracy dropped to 72.4\% in the Office-Home data set when using limited batch sizes. In addition to improving the reader's comprehension of recent techniques in DA, our study also highlights challenges and upcoming directions for research in this domain.

However, the "1F1B" schedule inevitably leads to weight inconsistency and weight staleness issues due to the cross-training of different mini-batches across GPUs. To simultaneously address these two problems, in this paper, we propose an optimizer-dependent weight prediction strategy (a.k.a PipeOptim) for asynchronous pipeline training. The key insight of our proposal is that we employ a weight prediction strategy in the forward pass to ensure that each mini-batch uses consistent and staleness-free weights to compute the forward pass. To be concrete, we first construct the weight prediction scheme based on the update rule of the used optimizer when training the deep neural network models. Then throughout the "1F1B" pipelined training, each mini-batch is mandated to execute weight prediction ahead of the forward pass, subsequently employing the predicted weights to perform the forward pass. As a result, PipeOptim 1) inherits the advantage of the "1F1B" schedule and generates pretty high throughput, and 2) can ensure effective parameter learning regardless of the type of the used optimizer. To verify the effectiveness of our proposal, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations using eight different deep-learning models spanning three machine-learning tasks including image classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. The experiment results demonstrate that PipeOptim outperforms the popular pipelined approaches including GPipe, PipeDream, PipeDream-2BW, and SpecTrain.

However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like image captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose the segment any change models (AnyChange), a new type of change detection model that supports zero-shot prediction and generalization on unseen change types and data distributions. AnyChange is built on the segment anything model (SAM) via our training-free adaptation method, bitemporal latent matching. By revealing and exploiting intra-image and inter-image semantic similarities in SAM's latent space, bitemporal latent matching endows SAM with zero-shot change detection capabilities in a training-free way. We also propose a point query mechanism to enable AnyChange's zero-shot object-centric change detection capability. We perform extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of AnyChange for zero-shot change detection. AnyChange sets a new record on the SECOND benchmark for unsupervised change detection, exceeding the previous SOTA by up to 4.4% F$_1$ score, and achieving comparable accuracy with negligible manual annotations (1 pixel per image) for supervised change detection.

Although neural networks (NNs) can tolerate modest amounts of these errors, their performance degrades substantially once error levels exceed a certain threshold. We propose a new loss reweighting, architecture-independent methodology, Rockafellian Relaxation Method (RRM) for neural network training. Experiments indicate RRM can enhance neural network methods to achieve robust performance across classification tasks in computer vision and natural language processing (sentiment analysis). We find that RRM can mitigate the effects of dataset contamination stemming from both (heavy) labeling error and/or adversarial perturbation, demonstrating effectiveness across a variety of data domains and machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Their learned representations often enable state-of-the-art performance for downstream tasks, such as image classification and segmentation. However, they employ many empirically motivated design choices and their training pipelines are highly complex and unstable -- many hyperparameters need to be carefully tuned to ensure that the representations do not collapse -- which poses considerable difficulty to improving them or adapting them to new domains. In this work, we posit that we can remove most such-motivated idiosyncrasies in the pre-training pipelines, and only need to add an explicit coding rate term in the loss function to avoid collapse of the representations. As a result, we obtain highly simplified variants of the DINO and DINOv2 which we call SimDINO and SimDINOv2, respectively. Remarkably, these simplified models are more robust to different design choices, such as network architecture and hyperparameters, and they learn even higher-quality representations, measured by performance on downstream tasks, offering a Pareto improvement over the corresponding DINO and DINOv2 models. This work highlights the potential of using simplifying design principles to improve the empirical practice of deep learning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, it demands a substantial and balanced dataset for effective training. Otherwise, networks frequently exhibit over fitting and struggle to generalize to new examples. Publicly available dataset of fundus images of ocular disease is insufficient to train any classification model to achieve satisfactory accuracy. So, we propose Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) based data generation technique to synthesize dataset for training CNN based classification model and later use original disease containing ocular images to test the model. During testing the model classification accuracy with the original ocular image, the model achieves an accuracy rate of 78.6% for myopia, 88.6% for glaucoma, and 84.6% for cataract, with an overall classification accuracy of 84.6%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SeWA: Selective Weight Average via Probabilistic Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10119v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight averaging has become a standard technique for enhancing model performance. However, methods such as Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Latest Weight Averaging (LAWA) often require manually designed procedures to sample from the training trajectory, and the results depend heavily on hyperparameter tuning. To minimize human effort, this paper proposes a simple yet efficient algorithm called Selective Weight Averaging (SeWA), which adaptively selects checkpoints during the final stages of training for averaging. Based on SeWA, we show that only a few points are needed to achieve better generalization and faster convergence. Theoretically, solving the discrete subset selection problem is inherently challenging. To address this, we transform it into a continuous probabilistic optimization framework and employ the Gumbel-Softmax estimator to learn the non-differentiable mask for each checkpoint. Further, we theoretically derive the SeWA's stability-based generalization bounds, which are sharper than that of SGD under both convex and non-convex assumptions. Finally, solid extended experiments in various domains, including behavior cloning, image classification, and text classification, further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches.

| **[Self-Training: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12040v6)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised algorithms aim to learn prediction functions from a small set of labeled observations and a large set of unlabeled observations. Because this framework is relevant in many applications, they have received a lot of interest in both academia and industry. Among the existing techniques, self-training methods have undoubtedly attracted greater attention in recent years. These models are designed to find the decision boundary on low density regions without making additional assumptions about the data distribution, and use the unsigned output score of a learned classifier, or its margin, as an indicator of confidence. The working principle of self-training algorithms is to learn a classifier iteratively by assigning pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training samples with a margin greater than a certain threshold. The pseudo-labeled examples are then used to enrich the labeled training data and to train a new classifier in conjunction with the labeled training set. In this paper, we present self-training methods for binary and multi-class classification; as well as their variants and two related approaches, namely consistency-based approaches and transductive learning. We examine the impact of significant self-training features on various methods, using different general and image classification benchmarks, and we discuss our ideas for future research in self-training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough and complete survey on this subject.</p></details> | 43 pages, 1 figure | None |

In this paper, we present the first quantitative analysis of this space folding phenomenon in ReLU neural networks. Our approach focuses on examining how straight paths in the Euclidean input space are mapped to their counterparts in the Hamming activation space. In this process, the convexity of straight lines is generally lost, giving rise to non-convex folding behavior. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel measure based on range metrics, similar to those used in the study of random walks, and provide the proof for the equivalence of convexity notions between the input and activation spaces. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on a geometrical analysis benchmark (CantorNet) as well as an image classification benchmark (MNIST). Our work advances the understanding of the activation space in ReLU neural networks by leveraging the phenomena of geometric folding, providing valuable insights on how these models process input information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> | None |

However, transfer learning of KANs remains a relatively unexplored area. In this paper, inspired by Tucker decomposition of tensors and evidence on the low tensor-rank structure in KAN parameter updates, we develop low tensor-rank adaptation (LoTRA) for fine-tuning KANs. We study the expressiveness of LoTRA based on Tucker decomposition approximations. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to select the learning rates for each LoTRA component to enable efficient training. Our analysis also shows that using identical learning rates across all components leads to inefficient training, highlighting the need for an adaptive learning rate strategy. Beyond theoretical insights, we explore the application of LoTRA for efficiently solving various partial differential equations (PDEs) by fine-tuning KANs. Additionally, we propose Slim KANs that incorporate the inherent low-tensor-rank properties of KAN parameter tensors to reduce model size while maintaining superior performance. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed learning rate selection strategy and demonstrate the effectiveness of LoTRA for transfer learning of KANs in solving PDEs. Further evaluations on Slim KANs for function representation and image classification tasks highlight the expressiveness of LoTRA and the potential for parameter reduction through low tensor-rank decomposition.</p></details> |  | None |

Morphological factors such as size, location, texture, and variable appearance complicate tumor inspection. Medical imaging presents challenges, including noise and incomplete images. This research article presents a methodology for processing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, encompassing techniques for image classification and denoising. The effective use of MRI images allows medical professionals to detect brain disorders, including tumors. This research aims to categorize healthy brain tissue and brain tumors by analyzing the provided MRI data. Unlike alternative methods like Computed Tomography (CT), MRI technology offers a more detailed representation of internal anatomical components, making it a suitable option for studying data related to brain tumors. The MRI picture is first subjected to a denoising technique utilizing an Anisotropic diffusion filter. The dataset utilized for the models creation is a publicly accessible and validated Brain Tumour Classification (MRI) database, comprising 3,264 brain MRI scans. SMOTE was employed for data augmentation and dataset balancing. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) such as ResNet152V2, VGG, ViT, and EfficientNet were employed for the classification procedure. EfficientNet attained an accuracy of 98%, the highest recorded.</p></details> |  | None |

Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives. However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS. This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures | None |
| **[Heuristical Comparison of Vision Transformers Against Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09101v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently brought a new wave of research in the field of computer vision. These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT. The code for this implementation can be found at: https://github.com/ashimdahal/ViT-vs-CNN-Image-Segmentation.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ashimdahal/ViT-vs-CNN-Image-Segmentation) |

It has been shown to enhance the training speed and accuracy of deep learning models. However, the mechanics by which BatchNorm achieves these benefits is an active area of research, and different perspectives have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the effect of BatchNorm on the resulting hidden representations, that is, the vectors of activation values formed as samples are processed at each hidden layer. Specifically, we consider the sparsity of these representations, as well as their implicit clustering -- the creation of groups of representations that are similar to some extent. We contrast image classification models trained with and without batch normalization and highlight consistent differences observed. These findings highlight that BatchNorm's effect on representational sparsity is not a significant factor affecting generalization, while the representations of models trained with BatchNorm tend to show more advantageous clustering characteristics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature-based Graph Attention Networks Improve Online Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09143v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online continual learning for image classification is crucial for models to adapt to new data while retaining knowledge of previously learned tasks. This capability is essential to address real-world challenges involving dynamic environments and evolving data distributions. Traditional approaches predominantly employ Convolutional Neural Networks, which are limited to processing images as grids and primarily capture local patterns rather than relational information. Although the emergence of transformer architectures has improved the ability to capture relationships, these models often require significantly larger resources. In this paper, we present a novel online continual learning framework based on Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which effectively capture contextual relationships and dynamically update the task-specific representation via learned attention weights. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained feature extractor to convert images into graphs using hierarchical feature maps, representing information at varying levels of granularity. These graphs are then processed by a GAT and incorporate an enhanced global pooling strategy to improve classification performance for continual learning. In addition, we propose the rehearsal memory duplication technique that improves the representation of the previous tasks while maintaining the memory budget. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MiniImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

Vision Transformers have mainly been limited to attention extraction to provide insight into the model's reasoning. Our approach combines the high performance of Vision Transformers with the introduction of new explainability capabilities. We present HierViT, a Vision Transformer that is inherently interpretable and adapts its reasoning to that of humans. A hierarchical structure is used to process domain-specific features for prediction. It is interpretable by design, as it derives the target output with human-defined features that are visualized by exemplary images (prototypes). By incorporating domain knowledge about these decisive features, the reasoning is semantically similar to human reasoning and therefore intuitive. Moreover, attention heatmaps visualize the crucial regions for identifying each feature, thereby providing HierViT with a versatile tool for validating predictions. Evaluated on two medical benchmark datasets, LIDC-IDRI for lung nodule assessment and derm7pt for skin lesion classification, HierViT achieves superior and comparable prediction accuracy, respectively, while offering explanations that align with human reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

Learning Minimum Variance Features With Label Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06855v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation has been pivotal in successfully training deep learning models on classification tasks over the past decade. An important subclass of data augmentation techniques - which includes both label smoothing and Mixup - involves modifying not only the input data but also the input label during model training. In this work, we analyze the role played by the label augmentation aspect of such methods. We first prove that linear models on binary classification data trained with label augmentation learn only the minimum variance features in the data, while standard training (which includes weight decay) can learn higher variance features. We then use our techniques to show that even for nonlinear models and general data distributions, the label smoothing and Mixup losses are lower bounded by a function of the model output variance. Lastly, we demonstrate empirically that this aspect of label smoothing and Mixup can be a positive and a negative. On the one hand, we show that the strong performance of label smoothing and Mixup on image classification benchmarks is correlated with learning low variance hidden representations. On the other hand, we show that Mixup and label smoothing can be more susceptible to low variance spurious correlations in the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, 25 pages, 8 figures</p></details> | None |

However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose Knowledge-Guided Visual representation learning (KGV) - a distribution-based learning approach leveraging multi-modal prior knowledge - to improve generalization under distribution shift. It integrates knowledge from two distinct modalities: 1) a knowledge graph (KG) with hierarchical and association relationships; and 2) generated synthetic images of visual elements semantically represented in the KG. The respective embeddings are generated from the given modalities in a common latent space, i.e., visual embeddings from original and synthetic images as well as knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). These embeddings are aligned via a novel variant of translation-based KGE methods, where the node and relation embeddings of the KG are modeled as Gaussian distributions and translations, respectively. We claim that incorporating multi-model prior knowledge enables more regularized learning of image representations. Thus, the models are able to better generalize across different data distributions. We evaluate KGV on different image classification tasks with major or minor distribution shifts, namely road sign classification across datasets from Germany, China, and Russia, image classification with the mini-ImageNet dataset and its variants, as well as the DVM-CAR dataset. The results demonstrate that KGV consistently exhibits higher accuracy and data efficiency across all experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by this, significant efforts have been made to enhance layer aggregation - reusing information from previous layers to better extract features at the current layer, to improve the representational power of deep neural networks. However, previous works have primarily addressed this problem from a discrete-state perspective which is not suitable as the number of network layers grows. This paper novelly treats the outputs from layers as states of a continuous process and considers leveraging the state space model (SSM) to design the aggregation of layers in very deep neural networks. Moreover, inspired by its advancements in modeling long sequences, the Selective State Space Models (S6) is employed to design a new module called Selective State Space Model Layer Aggregation (S6LA). This module aims to combine traditional CNN or transformer architectures within a sequential framework, enhancing the representational capabilities of state-of-the-art vision networks. Extensive experiments show that S6LA delivers substantial improvements in both image classification and detection tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating SSMs with contemporary deep learning techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the complex covariance matrices are essentially a complex Hermit positive definite (HPD) matrix endowed in Riemannian manifold rather than Euclidean space. The matrix's real and imagery parts are with the same significance, as the imagery part represents the phase information. The matrix vectorization will destroy the geometric structure and manifold characteristics of complex covariance matrices. To learn complex HPD matrices directly, we propose a Riemannian complex HPD convolution network(HPD\_CNN) for PolSAR images. This method consists of a complex HPD unfolding network(HPDnet) and a CV-3DCNN enhanced network. The proposed complex HPDnet defines the HPD mapping, rectifying and the logEig layers to learn geometric features of complex matrices. In addition, a fast eigenvalue decomposition method is designed to reduce computation burden. Finally, a Riemannian-to-Euclidean enhanced network is defined to enhance contextual information for classification. Experimental results on two real PolSSAR datasets demonstrate the proposed method can achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods especially in heterogeneous regions.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |

Despite enhancing image quality in adverse weather, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise their effectiveness. Traditional defenses such as adversarial training and model distillation often require extensive retraining, making them costly and impractical for real-world deployment. While denoising and super-resolution techniques can aid image classification models, they impose high computational demands and introduce visual artifacts that hinder image processing tasks. We propose a model-agnostic defense against first-order white-box adversarial attacks using the Quaternion-Hadamard Network (QHNet) to tackle these challenges. White-box attacks are particularly difficult to defend against since attackers have full access to the model's architecture, weights, and training procedures. Our defense introduces the Quaternion Hadamard Denoising Convolutional Block (QHDCB) and the Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB), leveraging polynomial thresholding. QHNet incorporates these blocks within an encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by feature refinement, to effectively neutralize adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce the Adversarial Weather Conditions Vision Dataset (AWCVD), created by applying first-order gradient attacks on state-of-the-art weather removal techniques in scenarios involving haze, rain streaks, and snow. Using PSNR and SSIM metrics, we demonstrate that QHNet significantly enhances the robustness of low-level computer vision models against adversarial attacks compared with state-of-the-art denoising and super-resolution techniques. The source code and dataset will be released alongside the final version of this paper.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, standard neural networks rely on dense, non-specialized architectures, where all model parameters are simultaneously updated to learn multiple tasks, leading to interference. Current sparse neural network approaches aim to alleviate this issue but are hindered by limitations such as 1) trainable gating functions that cause representation collapse, 2) disjoint experts that result in redundant computation and slow learning, and 3) reliance on explicit input or task IDs that limit flexibility and scalability. In this paper we propose Conditionally Overlapping Mixture of ExperTs (COMET), a general deep learning method that addresses these challenges by inducing a modular, sparse architecture with an exponential number of overlapping experts. COMET replaces the trainable gating function used in Sparse Mixture of Experts with a fixed, biologically inspired random projection applied to individual input representations. This design causes the degree of expert overlap to depend on input similarity, so that similar inputs tend to share more parameters. This results in faster learning per update step and improved out-of-sample generalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of COMET on a range of tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and regression, using several popular deep learning architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Enforcing doubly-stochastic constraints in attention matrices has been shown to improve structure and balance in attention distributions. However, existing methods rely on iterative Sinkhorn normalization, which is computationally costly. In this paper, we introduce a novel, fully parallelizable doubly-stochastic attention mechanism based on sliced optimal transport, leveraging Expected Sliced Transport Plans (ESP). Unlike prior approaches, our method enforces double stochasticity without iterative Sinkhorn normalization, significantly enhancing efficiency. To ensure differentiability, we incorporate a temperature-based soft sorting technique, enabling seamless integration into deep learning models. Experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, including image classification, point cloud classification, sentiment analysis, and neural machine translation, demonstrate that our enhanced attention regularization consistently improves performance across diverse applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the common practice of masking random patches of pixels exhibits certain failure modes, which can prevent learning meaningful high-level features, as required for downstream tasks. We propose an alternative masking strategy that operates on a suitable transformation of the data rather than on the raw pixels. Specifically, we perform principal component analysis and then randomly mask a subset of components, which accounts for a fixed ratio of the data variance. The learning task then amounts to reconstructing the masked components from the visible ones. Compared to local patches of pixels, the principal components of images carry more global information. We thus posit that predicting masked from visible components involves more high-level features, allowing our masking strategy to extract more useful representations. This is corroborated by our empirical findings which demonstrate improved image classification performance for component over pixel masking. Our method thus constitutes a simple and robust data-driven alternative to traditional masked image modeling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, they all require huge computational costs due to the usage of large-scale pre-trained DMs, making it difficult to conduct full evaluation under strong attacks and compare with traditional CNN-based methods. Simply reducing the network size and timesteps in DMs could significantly harm the image generation quality, which invalidates previous frameworks. To alleviate this issue, we redesign the diffusion framework from generating high-quality images to predicting distinguishable image labels. Specifically, we employ an image translation framework to learn many-to-one mapping from input samples to designed orthogonal image labels. Based on this framework, we introduce an efficient Image-to-Image diffusion classifier with a pruned U-Net structure and reduced diffusion timesteps. Besides the framework, we redesign the optimization objective of DMs to fit the target of image classification, where a new classification loss is incorporated in the DM-based image translation framework to distinguish the generated label from those of other classes. We conduct sufficient evaluations of the proposed classifier under various attacks on popular benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better adversarial robustness with fewer computational costs than DM-based and CNN-based methods.

Existing methods either require identical head counts or introduce projectors to bridge dimensional gaps, limiting flexibility and efficiency. We propose Squeezing-Heads Distillation (SHD), a novel approach that enables seamless knowledge transfer between models with varying head counts by compressing multi-head attention maps via efficient linear approximation. Unlike prior work, SHD eliminates alignment barriers without additional parameters or architectural modifications. Our method dynamically approximates the combined effect of multiple teacher heads into fewer student heads, preserving fine-grained attention patterns while reducing redundancy. Experiments across language (LLaMA, GPT) and vision (DiT, MDT) generative and vision (DeiT) discriminative tasks demonstrate SHD's effectiveness: it outperforms logit-based and feature-alignment KD baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in image classification, image generation language fine-tuning, and language pre-training. The key innovations of flexible head compression, projector-free design, and linear-time complexity make SHD a versatile and scalable solution for distilling modern transformers. This work bridges a critical gap in KD, enabling efficient deployment of compact models without compromising performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the focus of these design techniques has often overlooked critical metrics such as fairness, robustness, and generalization. As a result, when evaluating SOTA edge DNNs' performance in image classification using the FACET dataset, we found that they exhibit significant accuracy disparities (14.09%) across 10 different skin tones, alongside issues of non-robustness and poor generalizability. In response to these observations, we introduce Mixture-of-Experts-based Neural Architecture Search (MoENAS), an automatic design technique that navigates through a space of mixture of experts to discover accurate, fair, robust, and general edge DNNs. MoENAS improves the accuracy by 4.02% compared to SOTA edge DNNs and reduces the skin tone accuracy disparities from 14.09% to 5.60%, while enhancing robustness by 3.80% and minimizing overfitting to 0.21%, all while keeping model size close to state-of-the-art models average size (+0.4M). With these improvements, MoENAS establishes a new benchmark for edge DNN design, paving the way for the development of more inclusive and robust edge DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p></details> | first version | None |

To date, one of the strongest biases observed in image classification models is texture bias-where models overly rely on texture information rather than shape information. Yet, existing approaches for measuring and mitigating texture bias have not been able to capture how textures impact model robustness in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce the Texture Association Value (TAV), a novel metric that quantifies how strongly models rely on the presence of specific textures when classifying objects. Leveraging TAV, we demonstrate that model accuracy and robustness are heavily influenced by texture. Our results show that texture bias explains the existence of natural adversarial examples, where over 90% of these samples contain textures that are misaligned with the learned texture of their true label, resulting in confident mispredictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML)</p></details> | None |

Given a set of points in a metric space, the goal of $\textsf{MDMS}$ is to maximize an objective function combining a monotone submodular utility term and a min-distance diversity term between any pair of selected points, subject to a cardinality constraint. We propose the $\texttt{GIST}$ algorithm, which achieves a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation guarantee for $\textsf{MDMS}$ by approximating a series of maximum independent set problems with a bicriteria greedy algorithm. We also prove that it is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of $0.5584$. Finally, we demonstrate that $\texttt{GIST}$ outperforms existing benchmarks for on a real-world image classification task that studies single-shot subset selection for ImageNet.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures | None |

This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

This tension is particularly significant for emerging interpretable-by-design methods, which aim to redesign ML algorithms for trustworthy interpretability but often sacrifice accuracy in the process. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating the impact of deviations in concept representations-an essential component of interpretable models-on prediction performance and propose a novel framework to mitigate these effects. The framework builds on the principle of optimizing concept embeddings under constraints that preserve interpretability. Using a generative model as a test-bed, we rigorously prove that our algorithm achieves zero loss while progressively enhancing the interpretability of the resulting model. Additionally, we evaluate the practical performance of our proposed framework in generating explainable predictions for image classification tasks across various benchmarks. Compared to existing explainable methods, our approach not only improves prediction accuracy while preserving model interpretability across various large-scale benchmarks but also achieves this with significantly lower computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers $\unicode{x2013}$ such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles $\unicode{x2013}$ directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretable predictions. To support further research, we use public datasets and will release our code and preprocessing pipeline, providing a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 Workshop on Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models</p></details> | None |

However, it faces significant challenges due to the high-dimensional nature of the data and the complex spectral-spatial relationships inherent in HSI. Traditional methods, including conventional machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often struggle to effectively capture these intricate spectral-spatial features and global contextual information. Transformer-based models, while powerful in capturing long-range dependencies, often demand substantial computational resources, posing challenges in scenarios where labeled datasets are limited, as is commonly seen in HSI applications. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes GraphMamba, a hybrid model that combines spectral-spatial token generation, graph-based token prioritization, and cross-attention mechanisms. The model introduces a novel hybridization of state-space modeling and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), capturing both linear and nonlinear spatial-spectral dynamics. GraphMamba enhances the ability to model complex spatial-spectral relationships while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency across diverse HSI datasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that GraphMamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering a scalable and robust solution for complex HSI classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

While research on black-box attacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on pixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image classification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily depend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more suitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, query-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box attack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement Learning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget processes. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging rewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR effectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while adhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed attack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the confidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed state-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the MSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction to state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query. Further experiments on the Argoverse dataset using YOLOv8 confirm that RFPAR effectively removed objects on a larger scale dataset.

The unlabeled server dataset can either be pre-existing or generated through a data-free approach. The effectiveness of this approach critically depends on the method of assigning weights to client predictions when creating pseudo-labels, especially in highly heterogeneous settings. Inspired by theoretical results from GANs, we propose a provably near-optimal weighting method that leverages client discriminators trained with a server-distributed generator and local datasets. Our experiments on various image classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, we show that the additional communication cost, client-side privacy leakage, and client-side computational overhead introduced by our method are negligible, both in scenarios with and without a pre-existing server dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Addressing this gap, we introduce 'Global Awareness Enhanced Domain Adaptation' (GAN-DA), a novel approach that transcends traditional batch-based limitations. GAN-DA integrates a unique predefined feature representation (PFR) to facilitate the alignment of cross-domain distributions, thereby achieving a comprehensive global statistical awareness. This representation is innovatively expanded to encompass orthogonal and common feature aspects, which enhances the unification of global manifold structures and refines decision boundaries for more effective DA. Our extensive experiments, encompassing 27 diverse cross-domain image classification tasks, demonstrate GAN-DA's remarkable superiority, outperforming 24 established DA methods by a significant margin. Furthermore, our in-depth analyses shed light on the decision-making processes, revealing insights into the adaptability and efficiency of GAN-DA. This approach not only addresses the limitations of existing DA methodologies but also sets a new benchmark in the realm of domain adaptation, offering broad implications for future research and applications in this field.</p></details> |  | None |

Dataset pruning aims to alleviate this demand by discarding redundant examples. However, many existing methods require training a model with a full dataset over a large number of epochs before being able to prune the dataset, which ironically makes the pruning process more expensive than just training the model on the entire dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Difficulty and Uncertainty-Aware Lightweight (DUAL) score, which aims to identify important samples from the early training stage by considering both example difficulty and prediction uncertainty. To address a catastrophic accuracy drop at an extreme pruning, we further propose a ratio-adaptive sampling using Beta distribution. Experiments on various datasets and learning scenarios such as image classification with label noise and image corruption, and model architecture generalization demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Specifically, on ImageNet-1k, our method reduces the time cost for pruning to 66% compared to previous methods while achieving a SOTA, specifically 60% test accuracy at a 90% pruning ratio. On CIFAR datasets, the time cost is reduced to just 15% while maintaining SOTA performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, leading to information silos among them, which prevents these abilities from learning from each other and collaborating effectively. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions with a single transformer. EgoAgent unifies the representational spaces of the three abilities by mapping them all into a sequence of continuous tokens. Learnable query tokens are appended to obtain current states, future states, and next actions. With joint supervision, our agent model establishes the internal relationship among these three abilities and effectively mimics the human inference and learning processes. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent covering image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained model will be released for reproducibility.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its "black box" nature imposes significant limitations, particularly in sensitive application domains. While existing interpretable machine learning methods address some of these issues, they often fail to adequately consider feature correlations and provide insufficient evaluation of model decision paths. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Real Explainer (RealExp), an interpretability computation method that decouples the Shapley Value into individual feature importance and feature correlation importance. By incorporating feature similarity computations, RealExp enhances interpretability by precisely quantifying both individual feature contributions and their interactions, leading to more reliable and nuanced explanations. Additionally, this paper proposes a novel interpretability evaluation criterion focused on elucidating the decision paths of deep learning models, going beyond traditional accuracy-based metrics. Experimental validations on two unstructured data tasks -- image classification and text sentiment analysis -- demonstrate that RealExp significantly outperforms existing methods in interpretability. Case studies further illustrate its practical value: in image classification, RealExp aids in selecting suitable pre-trained models for specific tasks from an interpretability perspective; in text classification, it enables the optimization of models and approximates the performance of a fine-tuned GPT-Ada model using traditional bag-of-words approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Elsevier for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, they struggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To investigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and identify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated. Specifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes, which we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes evident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated along with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a novel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We introduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them into a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a corresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition (MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This ensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across modalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14 dataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007 and surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training parameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3 methods on COCO and VOC</p></details> |  | None |

Despite this rapid proliferation, the trustworthiness of foundation models remains underexplored. Specifically, the out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on massive multi-modal data, have not been sufficiently addressed. The disparity between their demonstrated potential and practical reliability raises concerns regarding the safe and trustworthy deployment of foundation models. To address this gap, we evaluate and analyze the OoDD capabilities of various proprietary and open-source LVLMs. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of how these foundation models represent confidence scores through their generated natural language responses.

While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.

However, its clinical application is often hindered by data heterogeneity caused by variations in scanner vendors, imaging protocols, and operators. Approaches such as invariant risk minimization (IRM) aim to address this challenge of out-of-distribution generalization. For instance, VIRM improves upon IRM by tackling the issue of insufficient feature support overlap, demonstrating promising potential. Nonetheless, these methods face limitations in medical imaging due to the scarcity of annotated data and the inefficiency of augmentation strategies. To address these issues, we propose a novel domain-oriented direction selector to replace the random augmentation strategy used in VIRM. Our method leverages inter-domain covariance as a guider for augmentation direction, guiding data augmentation towards the target domain. This approach effectively reduces domain discrepancies and enhances generalization performance. Experiments on a multi-center diabetic retinopathy dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly under limited data conditions and significant domain heterogeneity.</p></details> |  | None |

This work evaluates the performance of Vision Transformers architectures, including Swin Transformer and MaxViT, in several datasets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. We used three training sets of images with brain, lung, and kidney tumors. Each dataset includes different classification labels, from brain gliomas and meningiomas to benign and malignant lung conditions and kidney anomalies such as cysts and cancers. This work aims to analyze the behavior of the neural networks in each dataset and the benefits of combining different image modalities and tumor classes. We designed several experiments by fine-tuning the models on combined and individual image modalities. The results revealed that the Swin Transformer provided high accuracy, achieving up to 99.9\% for kidney tumor classification and 99.3\% accuracy in a combined dataset. MaxViT also provided excellent results in individual datasets but performed poorly when data is combined. This research highlights the adaptability of Transformer-based models to various image modalities and features. However, challenges persist, including limited annotated data and interpretability issues.

| **[Interpretable Failure Detection with Human-Level Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05275v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable failure detection holds paramount importance in safety-critical applications. Yet, neural networks are known to produce overconfident predictions for misclassified samples. As a result, it remains a problematic matter as existing confidence score functions rely on category-level signals, the logits, to detect failures. This research introduces an innovative strategy, leveraging human-level concepts for a dual purpose: to reliably detect when a model fails and to transparently interpret why. By integrating a nuanced array of signals for each category, our method enables a finer-grained assessment of the model's confidence. We present a simple yet highly effective approach based on the ordinal ranking of concept activation to the input image. Without bells and whistles, our method significantly reduce the false positive rate across diverse real-world image classification benchmarks, specifically by 3.7% on ImageNet and 9% on EuroSAT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis with Relation-aware Representation Learning and Iterative Classifier Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03238v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently computer-aided diagnosis has demonstrated promising performance, effectively alleviating the workload of clinicians. However, the inherent sample imbalance among different diseases leads algorithms biased to the majority categories, leading to poor performance for rare categories. Existing works formulated this challenge as a long-tailed problem and attempted to tackle it by decoupling the feature representation and classification. Yet, due to the imbalanced distribution and limited samples from tail classes, these works are prone to biased representation learning and insufficient classifier calibration. To tackle these problems, we propose a new Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis (LMD) framework for balanced medical image classification on long-tailed datasets. In the initial stage, we develop a Relation-aware Representation Learning (RRL) scheme to boost the representation ability by encouraging the encoder to capture intrinsic semantic features through different data augmentations. In the subsequent stage, we propose an Iterative Classifier Calibration (ICC) scheme to calibrate the classifier iteratively. This is achieved by generating a large number of balanced virtual features and fine-tuning the encoder using an Expectation-Maximization manner. The proposed ICC compensates for minority categories to facilitate unbiased classifier optimization while maintaining the diagnostic knowledge in majority classes. Comprehensive experiments on three public long-tailed medical datasets demonstrate that our LMD framework significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[TLXML: Task-Level Explanation of Meta-Learning via Influence Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14271v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scheme of adaptation via meta-learning is seen as an ingredient for solving the problem of data shortage or distribution shift in real-world applications, but it also brings the new risk of inappropriate updates of the model in the user environment, which increases the demand for explainability. Among the various types of XAI methods, establishing a method of explanation based on past experience in meta-learning requires special consideration due to its bi-level structure of training, which has been left unexplored. In this work, we propose influence functions for explaining meta-learning that measure the sensitivities of training tasks to adaptation and inference. We also argue that the approximation of the Hessian using the Gauss-Newton matrix resolves computational barriers peculiar to meta-learning. We demonstrate the adequacy of the method through experiments on task distinction and task distribution distinction using image classification tasks with MAML and Prototypical Network.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages; v2: modification in metadata</p></details> | None |
