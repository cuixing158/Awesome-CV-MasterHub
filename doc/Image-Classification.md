| **[Simplifying DINO via Coding Rate Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10385v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DINO and DINOv2 are two model families being widely used to learn representations from unlabeled imagery data at large scales. Their learned representations often enable state-of-the-art performance for downstream tasks, such as image classification and segmentation. However, they employ many empirically motivated design choices and their training pipelines are highly complex and unstable -- many hyperparameters need to be carefully tuned to ensure that the representations do not collapse -- which poses considerable difficulty to improving them or adapting them to new domains. In this work, we posit that we can remove most such-motivated idiosyncrasies in the pre-training pipelines, and only need to add an explicit coding rate term in the loss function to avoid collapse of the representations. As a result, we obtain highly simplified variants of the DINO and DINOv2 which we call SimDINO and SimDINOv2, respectively. Remarkably, these simplified models are more robust to different design choices, such as network architecture and hyperparameters, and they learn even higher-quality representations, measured by performance on downstream tasks, offering a Pareto improvement over the corresponding DINO and DINOv2 models. This work highlights the potential of using simplifying design principles to improve the empirical practice of deep learning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Ocular Disease Classification Using CNN with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10334v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown impressive performance in image classification because of its strong learning capabilities. However, it demands a substantial and balanced dataset for effective training. Otherwise, networks frequently exhibit over fitting and struggle to generalize to new examples. Publicly available dataset of fundus images of ocular disease is insufficient to train any classification model to achieve satisfactory accuracy. So, we propose Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) based data generation technique to synthesize dataset for training CNN based classification model and later use original disease containing ocular images to test the model. During testing the model classification accuracy with the original ocular image, the model achieves an accuracy rate of 78.6% for myopia, 88.6% for glaucoma, and 84.6% for cataract, with an overall classification accuracy of 84.6%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SeWA: Selective Weight Average via Probabilistic Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10119v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight averaging has become a standard technique for enhancing model performance. However, methods such as Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Latest Weight Averaging (LAWA) often require manually designed procedures to sample from the training trajectory, and the results depend heavily on hyperparameter tuning. To minimize human effort, this paper proposes a simple yet efficient algorithm called Selective Weight Averaging (SeWA), which adaptively selects checkpoints during the final stages of training for averaging. Based on SeWA, we show that only a few points are needed to achieve better generalization and faster convergence. Theoretically, solving the discrete subset selection problem is inherently challenging. To address this, we transform it into a continuous probabilistic optimization framework and employ the Gumbel-Softmax estimator to learn the non-differentiable mask for each checkpoint. Further, we theoretically derive the SeWA's stability-based generalization bounds, which are sharper than that of SGD under both convex and non-convex assumptions. Finally, solid extended experiments in various domains, including behavior cloning, image classification, and text classification, further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HaSPeR: An Image Repository for Hand Shadow Puppet Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10360v5)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand shadow puppetry, also known as shadowgraphy or ombromanie, is a form of theatrical art and storytelling where hand shadows are projected onto flat surfaces to create illusions of living creatures. The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches. Our code and data will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Machine Vision and Applications, 13 pages, 105 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Self-Training: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12040v6)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised algorithms aim to learn prediction functions from a small set of labeled observations and a large set of unlabeled observations. Because this framework is relevant in many applications, they have received a lot of interest in both academia and industry. Among the existing techniques, self-training methods have undoubtedly attracted greater attention in recent years. These models are designed to find the decision boundary on low density regions without making additional assumptions about the data distribution, and use the unsigned output score of a learned classifier, or its margin, as an indicator of confidence. The working principle of self-training algorithms is to learn a classifier iteratively by assigning pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training samples with a margin greater than a certain threshold. The pseudo-labeled examples are then used to enrich the labeled training data and to train a new classifier in conjunction with the labeled training set. In this paper, we present self-training methods for binary and multi-class classification; as well as their variants and two related approaches, namely consistency-based approaches and transductive learning. We examine the impact of significant self-training features on various methods, using different general and image classification benchmarks, and we discuss our ideas for future research in self-training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough and complete survey on this subject.</p></details> | 43 pages, 1 figure | None |
| **[On Space Folds of ReLU Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09954v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent findings suggest that the consecutive layers of ReLU neural networks can be understood geometrically as space folding transformations of the input space, revealing patterns of self-similarity. In this paper, we present the first quantitative analysis of this space folding phenomenon in ReLU neural networks. Our approach focuses on examining how straight paths in the Euclidean input space are mapped to their counterparts in the Hamming activation space. In this process, the convexity of straight lines is generally lost, giving rise to non-convex folding behavior. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel measure based on range metrics, similar to those used in the study of random walks, and provide the proof for the equivalence of convexity notions between the input and activation spaces. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on a geometrical analysis benchmark (CantorNet) as well as an image classification benchmark (MNIST). Our work advances the understanding of the activation space in ReLU neural networks by leveraging the phenomena of geometric folding, providing valuable insights on how these models process input information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> | None |
