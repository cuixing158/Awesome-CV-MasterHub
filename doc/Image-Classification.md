| **[Metalearning Continual Learning Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00276v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose learning systems should improve themselves in open-ended fashion in ever-changing environments. Conventional learning algorithms for neural networks, however, suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF), i.e., previously acquired skills are forgotten when a new task is learned. Instead of hand-crafting new algorithms for avoiding CF, we propose Automated Continual Learning (ACL) to train self-referential neural networks to metalearn their own in-context continual (meta)learning algorithms. ACL encodes continual learning (CL) desiderata -- good performance on both old and new tasks -- into its metalearning objectives. Our experiments demonstrate that ACL effectively resolves "in-context catastrophic forgetting," a problem that naive in-context learning algorithms suffer from; ACL-learned algorithms outperform both hand-crafted learning algorithms and popular meta-continual learning methods on the Split-MNIST benchmark in the replay-free setting, and enables continual learning of diverse tasks consisting of multiple standard image classification datasets. We also discuss the current limitations of in-context CL by comparing ACL with state-of-the-art CL methods that leverage pre-trained models. Overall, we bring several novel perspectives into the long-standing problem of CL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 02/2025.

| **[Knowledge Swapping via Learning and Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08075v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce \textbf{Knowledge Swapping}, a novel task designed to selectively regulate knowledge of a pretrained model by enabling the forgetting of user\-specified information, retaining essential knowledge, and acquiring new knowledge simultaneously. By delving into the analysis of knock-on feature hierarchy, we find that incremental learning typically progresses from low\-level representations to higher\-level semantics, whereas forgetting tends to occur in the opposite direction\-starting from high-level semantics and moving down to low-level features. Building upon this, we propose to benchmark the knowledge swapping task with the strategy of \textit{Learning Before Forgetting}. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping}{https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping}.</p></details> | 10 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping) |
| **[PrototypeFormer: Learning to Explore Prototype Relationships for Few-shot Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03517v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot image classification has received considerable attention for overcoming the challenge of limited classification performance with limited samples in novel classes. Most existing works employ sophisticated learning strategies and feature learning modules to alleviate this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel method called PrototypeFormer, exploring the relationships among category prototypes in the few-shot scenario. Specifically, we utilize a transformer architecture to build a prototype extraction module, aiming to extract class representations that are more discriminative for few-shot classification. Besides, during the model training process, we propose a contrastive learning-based optimization approach to optimize prototype features in few-shot learning scenarios. Despite its simplicity, our method performs remarkably well, with no bells and whistles. We have experimented with our approach on several popular few-shot image classification benchmark datasets, which shows that our method outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our method achieves 97.07\% and 90.88\% on 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 1-shot tasks of miniImageNet, which surpasses the state-of-the-art results with accuracy of 0.57\% and 6.84\%, respectively. The code will be released later.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Neurocomputing</p></details> | None |
| **[REP: Resource-Efficient Prompting for Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04772v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rehearsal-free methods, guided by prompts, excel in vision-related continual learning (CL) with drifting data but lack resource efficiency, making real-world deployment challenging. In this paper, we introduce Resource-Efficient Prompting (REP), which improves the computational and memory efficiency of prompt-based rehearsal-free methods while minimizing accuracy trade-offs. Our approach employs swift prompt selection to refine input data using a carefully provisioned model and introduces adaptive token merging (AToM) and layer dropping (ALD) for efficient prompt updates. AToM and ALD selectively skip data and model layers while preserving task-specific features during new-task learning. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification datasets demonstrates REP's superior resource efficiency over state-of-the-art ViT- and CNN-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Conditional Mutual Information to Improve Large Language Model Fine-Tuning For Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11258v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, the potential of information theory (IT) to enhance LLM development remains underexplored. This paper introduces the information theoretic principle of Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) to LLM fine-tuning for classification tasks, exploring its promise in two main ways: minimizing CMI to improve a model's standalone performance and maximizing CMI to enhance knowledge distillation (KD) for more capable student models. To apply CMI in LLM fine-tuning, we adapt the recently proposed CMI-constrained deep learning framework, which was initially developed for image classification, with some modification. By minimizing CMI during LLM fine-tuning, we achieve superior performance gains on 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to BERT. Additionally, maximizing CMI during the KD process results in significant performance improvements in 6 of 8 GLUE classification tasks compared to DistilBERT. These findings demonstrate CMI's adaptability for optimizing both standalone LLMs and student models, showcasing its potential as a robust framework for advancing LLM fine-tuning. Our work bridges the gap between information theory and LLM development, offering new insights for building high-performing language models.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[An Enhancement of CNN Algorithm for Rice Leaf Disease Image Classification in Mobile Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07182v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study focuses on enhancing rice leaf disease image classification algorithms, which have traditionally relied on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. We employed transfer learning with MobileViTV2_050 using ImageNet-1k weights, a lightweight model that integrates CNN's local feature extraction with Vision Transformers' global context learning through a separable self-attention mechanism. Our approach resulted in a significant 15.66% improvement in classification accuracy for MobileViTV2_050-A, our first enhanced model trained on the baseline dataset, achieving 93.14%. Furthermore, MobileViTV2_050-B, our second enhanced model trained on a broader rice leaf dataset, demonstrated a 22.12% improvement, reaching 99.6% test accuracy. Additionally, MobileViTV2-A attained an F1-score of 93% across four rice labels and a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve ranging from 87% to 97%. In terms of resource consumption, our enhanced models reduced the total parameters of the baseline CNN model by up to 92.50%, from 14 million to 1.1 million. These results indicate that MobileViTV2_050 not only improves computational efficiency through its separable self-attention mechanism but also enhances global context learning. Consequently, it offers a lightweight and robust solution suitable for mobile deployment, advancing the interpretability and practicality of models in precision agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 46th World Conference on Applied Science, Engineering & Technology (WCASET) from Institute for Educational Research and Publication (IFERP)</p></details> | None |
| **[JPEG Inspired Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07081v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although it is traditionally believed that lossy image compression, such as JPEG compression, has a negative impact on the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), it is shown by recent works that well-crafted JPEG compression can actually improve the performance of deep learning (DL). Inspired by this, we propose JPEG-DL, a novel DL framework that prepends any underlying DNN architecture with a trainable JPEG compression layer. To make the quantization operation in JPEG compression trainable, a new differentiable soft quantizer is employed at the JPEG layer, and then the quantization operation and underlying DNN are jointly trained. Extensive experiments show that in comparison with the standard DL, JPEG-DL delivers significant accuracy improvements across various datasets and model architectures while enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks. Particularly, on some fine-grained image classification datasets, JPEG-DL can increase prediction accuracy by as much as 20.9%.

| **[Simulations of Common Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Algorithms for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10694v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional machine learning assumes that training and test sets are derived from the same distribution; however, this assumption does not always hold in practical applications. This distribution disparity can lead to severe performance drops when the trained model is used in new data sets. Domain adaptation (DA) is a machine learning technique that aims to address this problem by reducing the differences between domains. This paper presents simulation-based algorithms of recent DA techniques, mainly related to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), where labels are available only in the source domain. Our study compares these techniques with public data sets and diverse characteristics, highlighting their respective strengths and drawbacks. For example, Safe Self-Refinement for Transformer-based DA (SSRT) achieved the highest accuracy (91.6\%) in the office-31 data set during our simulations, however, the accuracy dropped to 72.4\% in the Office-Home data set when using limited batch sizes. In addition to improving the reader's comprehension of recent techniques in DA, our study also highlights challenges and upcoming directions for research in this domain.

| **[PipeOptim: Ensuring Effective 1F1B Schedule with Optimizer-Dependent Weight Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00839v3)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Asynchronous pipeline model parallelism with a "1F1B" (one forward, one backward) schedule generates little bubble overhead and always provides quite a high throughput. However, the "1F1B" schedule inevitably leads to weight inconsistency and weight staleness issues due to the cross-training of different mini-batches across GPUs. To simultaneously address these two problems, in this paper, we propose an optimizer-dependent weight prediction strategy (a.k.a PipeOptim) for asynchronous pipeline training. The key insight of our proposal is that we employ a weight prediction strategy in the forward pass to ensure that each mini-batch uses consistent and staleness-free weights to compute the forward pass. To be concrete, we first construct the weight prediction scheme based on the update rule of the used optimizer when training the deep neural network models. Then throughout the "1F1B" pipelined training, each mini-batch is mandated to execute weight prediction ahead of the forward pass, subsequently employing the predicted weights to perform the forward pass. As a result, PipeOptim 1) inherits the advantage of the "1F1B" schedule and generates pretty high throughput, and 2) can ensure effective parameter learning regardless of the type of the used optimizer. To verify the effectiveness of our proposal, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations using eight different deep-learning models spanning three machine-learning tasks including image classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. The experiment results demonstrate that PipeOptim outperforms the popular pipelined approaches including GPipe, PipeDream, PipeDream-2BW, and SpecTrain. The code of PipeOptim can be accessible at https://github.com/guanleics/PipeOptim.</p></details> | 15 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/guanleics/PipeOptim) |
| **[REAL: Realism Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for Effective Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10663v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation models have transformed the field. However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like im- age captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Segment Any Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01188v4)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual foundation models have achieved remarkable results in zero-shot image classification and segmentation, but zero-shot change detection remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose the segment any change models (AnyChange), a new type of change detection model that supports zero-shot prediction and generalization on unseen change types and data distributions. AnyChange is built on the segment anything model (SAM) via our training-free adaptation method, bitemporal latent matching. By revealing and exploiting intra-image and inter-image semantic similarities in SAM's latent space, bitemporal latent matching endows SAM with zero-shot change detection capabilities in a training-free way. We also propose a point query mechanism to enable AnyChange's zero-shot object-centric change detection capability. We perform extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of AnyChange for zero-shot change detection. AnyChange sets a new record on the SECOND benchmark for unsupervised change detection, exceeding the previous SOTA by up to 4.4% F$_1$ score, and achieving comparable accuracy with negligible manual annotations (1 pixel per image) for supervised change detection.

| **[Mitigating the Impact of Labeling Errors on Training via Rockafellian Relaxation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20531v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeling errors in datasets are common, arising in a variety of contexts, such as human labeling, noisy labeling, and weak labeling (i.e., image classification). Although neural networks (NNs) can tolerate modest amounts of these errors, their performance degrades substantially once error levels exceed a certain threshold. We propose a new loss reweighting, architecture-independent methodology, Rockafellian Relaxation Method (RRM) for neural network training. Experiments indicate RRM can enhance neural network methods to achieve robust performance across classification tasks in computer vision and natural language processing (sentiment analysis). We find that RRM can mitigate the effects of dataset contamination stemming from both (heavy) labeling error and/or adversarial perturbation, demonstrating effectiveness across a variety of data domains and machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Simplifying DINO via Coding Rate Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10385v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DINO and DINOv2 are two model families being widely used to learn representations from unlabeled imagery data at large scales. Their learned representations often enable state-of-the-art performance for downstream tasks, such as image classification and segmentation. However, they employ many empirically motivated design choices and their training pipelines are highly complex and unstable -- many hyperparameters need to be carefully tuned to ensure that the representations do not collapse -- which poses considerable difficulty to improving them or adapting them to new domains. In this work, we posit that we can remove most such-motivated idiosyncrasies in the pre-training pipelines, and only need to add an explicit coding rate term in the loss function to avoid collapse of the representations. As a result, we obtain highly simplified variants of the DINO and DINOv2 which we call SimDINO and SimDINOv2, respectively. Remarkably, these simplified models are more robust to different design choices, such as network architecture and hyperparameters, and they learn even higher-quality representations, measured by performance on downstream tasks, offering a Pareto improvement over the corresponding DINO and DINOv2 models. This work highlights the potential of using simplifying design principles to improve the empirical practice of deep learning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Ocular Disease Classification Using CNN with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10334v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown impressive performance in image classification because of its strong learning capabilities. However, it demands a substantial and balanced dataset for effective training. Otherwise, networks frequently exhibit over fitting and struggle to generalize to new examples. Publicly available dataset of fundus images of ocular disease is insufficient to train any classification model to achieve satisfactory accuracy. So, we propose Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) based data generation technique to synthesize dataset for training CNN based classification model and later use original disease containing ocular images to test the model. During testing the model classification accuracy with the original ocular image, the model achieves an accuracy rate of 78.6% for myopia, 88.6% for glaucoma, and 84.6% for cataract, with an overall classification accuracy of 84.6%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SeWA: Selective Weight Average via Probabilistic Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10119v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight averaging has become a standard technique for enhancing model performance. However, methods such as Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Latest Weight Averaging (LAWA) often require manually designed procedures to sample from the training trajectory, and the results depend heavily on hyperparameter tuning. To minimize human effort, this paper proposes a simple yet efficient algorithm called Selective Weight Averaging (SeWA), which adaptively selects checkpoints during the final stages of training for averaging. Based on SeWA, we show that only a few points are needed to achieve better generalization and faster convergence. Theoretically, solving the discrete subset selection problem is inherently challenging. To address this, we transform it into a continuous probabilistic optimization framework and employ the Gumbel-Softmax estimator to learn the non-differentiable mask for each checkpoint. Further, we theoretically derive the SeWA's stability-based generalization bounds, which are sharper than that of SGD under both convex and non-convex assumptions. Finally, solid extended experiments in various domains, including behavior cloning, image classification, and text classification, further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HaSPeR: An Image Repository for Hand Shadow Puppet Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10360v5)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand shadow puppetry, also known as shadowgraphy or ombromanie, is a form of theatrical art and storytelling where hand shadows are projected onto flat surfaces to create illusions of living creatures. The skilled performers create these silhouettes by hand positioning, finger movements, and dexterous gestures to resemble shadows of animals and objects. Due to the lack of practitioners and a seismic shift in people's entertainment standards, this art form is on the verge of extinction. To facilitate its preservation and proliferate it to a wider audience, we introduce ${\rm H{\small A}SP{\small E}R}$, a novel dataset consisting of 15,000 images of hand shadow puppets across 15 classes extracted from both professional and amateur hand shadow puppeteer clips. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of pretrained image classification models to establish baselines. Our findings show a substantial performance superiority of skip-connected convolutional models over attention-based transformer architectures. We also find that lightweight models, such as MobileNetV2, suited for mobile applications and embedded devices, perform comparatively well. We surmise that such low-latency architectures can be useful in developing ombromanie teaching tools, and we create a prototype application to explore this surmission. Keeping the best-performing model ResNet34 under the limelight, we conduct comprehensive feature-spatial, explainability, and error analyses to gain insights into its decision-making process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented dataset and research endeavor to preserve this dying art for future generations, with computer vision approaches. Our code and data will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Machine Vision and Applications, 13 pages, 105 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Self-Training: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12040v6)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised algorithms aim to learn prediction functions from a small set of labeled observations and a large set of unlabeled observations. Because this framework is relevant in many applications, they have received a lot of interest in both academia and industry. Among the existing techniques, self-training methods have undoubtedly attracted greater attention in recent years. These models are designed to find the decision boundary on low density regions without making additional assumptions about the data distribution, and use the unsigned output score of a learned classifier, or its margin, as an indicator of confidence. The working principle of self-training algorithms is to learn a classifier iteratively by assigning pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training samples with a margin greater than a certain threshold. The pseudo-labeled examples are then used to enrich the labeled training data and to train a new classifier in conjunction with the labeled training set. In this paper, we present self-training methods for binary and multi-class classification; as well as their variants and two related approaches, namely consistency-based approaches and transductive learning. We examine the impact of significant self-training features on various methods, using different general and image classification benchmarks, and we discuss our ideas for future research in self-training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough and complete survey on this subject.</p></details> | 43 pages, 1 figure | None |
| **[On Space Folds of ReLU Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09954v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent findings suggest that the consecutive layers of ReLU neural networks can be understood geometrically as space folding transformations of the input space, revealing patterns of self-similarity. In this paper, we present the first quantitative analysis of this space folding phenomenon in ReLU neural networks. Our approach focuses on examining how straight paths in the Euclidean input space are mapped to their counterparts in the Hamming activation space. In this process, the convexity of straight lines is generally lost, giving rise to non-convex folding behavior. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel measure based on range metrics, similar to those used in the study of random walks, and provide the proof for the equivalence of convexity notions between the input and activation spaces. Furthermore, we provide empirical analysis on a geometrical analysis benchmark (CantorNet) as well as an image classification benchmark (MNIST). Our work advances the understanding of the activation space in ReLU neural networks by leveraging the phenomena of geometric folding, providing valuable insights on how these models process input information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Low Tensor-Rank Adaptation of Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06153v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov--Arnold networks (KANs) have demonstrated their potential as an alternative to multi-layer perceptions (MLPs) in various domains, especially for science-related tasks. However, transfer learning of KANs remains a relatively unexplored area. In this paper, inspired by Tucker decomposition of tensors and evidence on the low tensor-rank structure in KAN parameter updates, we develop low tensor-rank adaptation (LoTRA) for fine-tuning KANs. We study the expressiveness of LoTRA based on Tucker decomposition approximations. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to select the learning rates for each LoTRA component to enable efficient training. Our analysis also shows that using identical learning rates across all components leads to inefficient training, highlighting the need for an adaptive learning rate strategy. Beyond theoretical insights, we explore the application of LoTRA for efficiently solving various partial differential equations (PDEs) by fine-tuning KANs. Additionally, we propose Slim KANs that incorporate the inherent low-tensor-rank properties of KAN parameter tensors to reduce model size while maintaining superior performance. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed learning rate selection strategy and demonstrate the effectiveness of LoTRA for transfer learning of KANs in solving PDEs. Further evaluations on Slim KANs for function representation and image classification tasks highlight the expressiveness of LoTRA and the potential for parameter reduction through low tensor-rank decomposition.</p></details> |  | None |

Morphological factors such as size, location, texture, and variable appearance com- plicate tumor inspection. Medical imaging presents challenges, including noise and incomplete images. This research article presents a methodology for processing Magnetic Resonance Imag- ing (MRI) data, encompassing techniques for image classification and denoising. The effective use of MRI images allows medical professionals to detect brain disorders, including tumors. This research aims to categorize healthy brain tissue and brain tumors by analyzing the provided MRI data. Unlike alternative methods like Computed Tomography (CT), MRI technology offers a more detailed representation of internal anatomical components, mak- ing it a suitable option for studying data related to brain tumors. The MRI picture is first subjected to a denoising technique utilizing an Anisotropic diffusion filter. The dataset utilized for the models creation is a publicly accessible and validated Brain Tumour Classification (MRI) database, comprising 3,264 brain MRI scans. SMOTE was employed for data augmentation and dataset balancing. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) such as ResNet152V2, VGG, ViT, and EfficientNet were employed for the classification procedure. EfficientNet attained an accuracy of 98%, the highest recorded.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GAIA: A Global, Multi-modal, Multi-scale Vision-Language Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09598v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The continuous operation of Earth-orbiting satellites generates vast and ever-growing archives of Remote Sensing (RS) images. Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives. However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS. This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures | None |
| **[Heuristical Comparison of Vision Transformers Against Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09101v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently brought a new wave of research in the field of computer vision. These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT. The code for this implementation can be found at: https://github.com/ashimdahal/ViT-vs-CNN-Image-Segmentation.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ashimdahal/ViT-vs-CNN-Image-Segmentation) |
| **[Impact of Batch Normalization on Convolutional Network Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14441v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch normalization (BatchNorm) is a popular layer normalization technique used when training deep neural networks. It has been shown to enhance the training speed and accuracy of deep learning models. However, the mechanics by which BatchNorm achieves these benefits is an active area of research, and different perspectives have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the effect of BatchNorm on the resulting hidden representations, that is, the vectors of activation values formed as samples are processed at each hidden layer. Specifically, we consider the sparsity of these representations, as well as their implicit clustering -- the creation of groups of representations that are similar to some extent. We contrast image classification models trained with and without batch normalization and highlight consistent differences observed. These findings highlight that BatchNorm's effect on representational sparsity is not a significant factor affecting generalization, while the representations of models trained with BatchNorm tend to show more advantageous clustering characteristics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feature-based Graph Attention Networks Improve Online Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09143v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online continual learning for image classification is crucial for models to adapt to new data while retaining knowledge of previously learned tasks. This capability is essential to address real-world challenges involving dynamic environments and evolving data distributions. Traditional approaches predominantly employ Convolutional Neural Networks, which are limited to processing images as grids and primarily capture local patterns rather than relational information. Although the emergence of transformer architectures has improved the ability to capture relationships, these models often require significantly larger resources. In this paper, we present a novel online continual learning framework based on Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which effectively capture contextual relationships and dynamically update the task-specific representation via learned attention weights. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained feature extractor to convert images into graphs using hierarchical feature maps, representing information at varying levels of granularity. These graphs are then processed by a GAT and incorporate an enhanced global pooling strategy to improve classification performance for continual learning. In addition, we propose the rehearsal memory duplication technique that improves the representation of the previous tasks while maintaining the memory budget. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MiniImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |
| **[Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Prototypes for Interpretable Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08997v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability is a highly demanded requirement for applications in high-risk areas such as medicine. Vision Transformers have mainly been limited to attention extraction to provide insight into the model's reasoning. Our approach combines the high performance of Vision Transformers with the introduction of new explainability capabilities. We present HierViT, a Vision Transformer that is inherently interpretable and adapts its reasoning to that of humans. A hierarchical structure is used to process domain-specific features for prediction. It is interpretable by design, as it derives the target output with human-defined features that are visualized by exemplary images (prototypes). By incorporating domain knowledge about these decisive features, the reasoning is semantically similar to human reasoning and therefore intuitive. Moreover, attention heatmaps visualize the crucial regions for identifying each feature, thereby providing HierViT with a versatile tool for validating predictions. Evaluated on two medical benchmark datasets, LIDC-IDRI for lung nodule assessment and derm7pt for skin lesion classification, HierViT achieves superior and comparable prediction accuracy, respectively, while offering explanations that align with human reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

Learning Minimum Variance Features With Label Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06855v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation has been pivotal in successfully training deep learning models on classification tasks over the past decade. An important subclass of data augmentation techniques - which includes both label smoothing and Mixup - involves modifying not only the input data but also the input label during model training. In this work, we analyze the role played by the label augmentation aspect of such methods. We first prove that linear models on binary classification data trained with label augmentation learn only the minimum variance features in the data, while standard training (which includes weight decay) can learn higher variance features. We then use our techniques to show that even for nonlinear models and general data distributions, the label smoothing and Mixup losses are lower bounded by a function of the model output variance. Lastly, we demonstrate empirically that this aspect of label smoothing and Mixup can be a positive and a negative. On the one hand, we show that the strong performance of label smoothing and Mixup on image classification benchmarks is correlated with learning low variance hidden representations. On the other hand, we show that Mixup and label smoothing can be more susceptible to low variance spurious correlations in the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, 25 pages, 8 figures</p></details> | None |

However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> | None |
| **[Robust Visual Representation Learning with Multi-modal Prior Knowledge for Image Classification Under Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15981v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in computer vision, they fail to remain high-performing when facing distribution shifts between training and testing data. In this paper, we propose Knowledge-Guided Visual representation learning (KGV) - a distribution-based learning approach leveraging multi-modal prior knowledge - to improve generalization under distribution shift. It integrates knowledge from two distinct modalities: 1) a knowledge graph (KG) with hierarchical and association relationships; and 2) generated synthetic images of visual elements semantically represented in the KG. The respective embeddings are generated from the given modalities in a common latent space, i.e., visual embeddings from original and synthetic images as well as knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). These embeddings are aligned via a novel variant of translation-based KGE methods, where the node and relation embeddings of the KG are modeled as Gaussian distributions and translations, respectively. We claim that incorporating multi-model prior knowledge enables more regularized learning of image representations. Thus, the models are able to better generalize across different data distributions. We evaluate KGV on different image classification tasks with major or minor distribution shifts, namely road sign classification across datasets from Germany, China, and Russia, image classification with the mini-ImageNet dataset and its variants, as well as the DVM-CAR dataset. The results demonstrate that KGV consistently exhibits higher accuracy and data efficiency across all experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by this, significant efforts have been made to enhance layer aggregation - reusing information from previous layers to better extract features at the current layer, to improve the representational power of deep neural networks. However, previous works have primarily addressed this problem from a discrete-state perspective which is not suitable as the number of network layers grows. This paper novelly treats the outputs from layers as states of a continuous process and considers leveraging the state space model (SSM) to design the aggregation of layers in very deep neural networks. Moreover, inspired by its advancements in modeling long sequences, the Selective State Space Models (S6) is employed to design a new module called Selective State Space Model Layer Aggregation (S6LA). This module aims to combine traditional CNN or transformer architectures within a sequential framework, enhancing the representational capabilities of state-of-the-art vision networks. Extensive experiments show that S6LA delivers substantial improvements in both image classification and detection tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating SSMs with contemporary deep learning techniques.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Riemannian Complex Hermit Positive Definite Convolution Network for Polarimetric SAR Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08137v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning can learn high-level semantic features in Euclidean space effectively for PolSAR images, while they need to covert the complex covariance matrix into a feature vector or complex-valued vector as the network input. However, the complex covariance matrices are essentially a complex Hermit positive definite (HPD) matrix endowed in Riemannian manifold rather than Euclidean space. The matrix's real and imagery parts are with the same significance, as the imagery part represents the phase information. The matrix vectorization will destroy the geometric structure and manifold characteristics of complex covariance matrices. To learn complex HPD matrices directly, we propose a Riemannian complex HPD convolution network(HPD\_CNN) for PolSAR images. This method consists of a complex HPD unfolding network(HPDnet) and a CV-3DCNN enhanced network. The proposed complex HPDnet defines the HPD mapping, rectifying and the logEig layers to learn geometric features of complex matrices. In addition, a fast eigenvalue decomposition method is designed to reduce computation burden. Finally, a Riemannian-to-Euclidean enhanced network is defined to enhance contextual information for classification. Experimental results on two real PolSSAR datasets demonstrate the proposed method can achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods especially in heterogeneous regions.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |

Despite enhancing image quality in adverse weather, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise their effectiveness. Traditional defenses such as adversarial training and model distillation often require extensive retraining, making them costly and impractical for real-world deployment. While denoising and super-resolution techniques can aid image classification models, they impose high computational demands and introduce visual artifacts that hinder image processing tasks. We propose a model-agnostic defense against first-order white-box adversarial attacks using the Quaternion-Hadamard Network (QHNet) to tackle these challenges. White-box attacks are particularly difficult to defend against since attackers have full access to the model's architecture, weights, and training procedures. Our defense introduces the Quaternion Hadamard Denoising Convolutional Block (QHDCB) and the Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB), leveraging polynomial thresholding. QHNet incorporates these blocks within an encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by feature refinement, to effectively neutralize adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce the Adversarial Weather Conditions Vision Dataset (AWCVD), created by applying first-order gradient attacks on state-of-the-art weather removal techniques in scenarios involving haze, rain streaks, and snow. Using PSNR and SSIM metrics, we demonstrate that QHNet significantly enhances the robustness of low-level computer vision models against adversarial attacks compared with state-of-the-art denoising and super-resolution techniques. The source code and dataset will be released alongside the final version of this paper.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[More Experts Than Galaxies: Conditionally-overlapping Experts With Biologically-Inspired Fixed Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08003v6)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of biological neural systems has led to both modularity and sparse coding, which enables energy efficiency and robustness across the diversity of tasks in the lifespan. In contrast, standard neural networks rely on dense, non-specialized architectures, where all model parameters are simultaneously updated to learn multiple tasks, leading to interference. Current sparse neural network approaches aim to alleviate this issue but are hindered by limitations such as 1) trainable gating functions that cause representation collapse, 2) disjoint experts that result in redundant computation and slow learning, and 3) reliance on explicit input or task IDs that limit flexibility and scalability. In this paper we propose Conditionally Overlapping Mixture of ExperTs (COMET), a general deep learning method that addresses these challenges by inducing a modular, sparse architecture with an exponential number of overlapping experts. COMET replaces the trainable gating function used in Sparse Mixture of Experts with a fixed, biologically inspired random projection applied to individual input representations. This design causes the degree of expert overlap to depend on input similarity, so that similar inputs tend to share more parameters. This results in faster learning per update step and improved out-of-sample generalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of COMET on a range of tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and regression, using several popular deep learning architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Enforcing doubly-stochastic constraints in attention matrices has been shown to improve structure and balance in attention distributions. However, existing methods rely on iterative Sinkhorn normalization, which is computationally costly. In this paper, we introduce a novel, fully parallelizable doubly-stochastic attention mechanism based on sliced optimal transport, leveraging Expected Sliced Transport Plans (ESP). Unlike prior approaches, our method enforces double stochasticity without iterative Sinkhorn normalization, significantly enhancing efficiency. To ensure differentiability, we incorporate a temperature-based soft sorting technique, enabling seamless integration into deep learning models. Experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, including image classification, point cloud classification, sentiment analysis, and neural machine translation, demonstrate that our enhanced attention regularization consistently improves performance across diverse applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Pixels to Components: Eigenvector Masking for Visual Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06314v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting masked from visible parts of an image is a powerful self-supervised approach for visual representation learning. However, the common practice of masking random patches of pixels exhibits certain failure modes, which can prevent learning meaningful high-level features, as required for downstream tasks. We propose an alternative masking strategy that operates on a suitable transformation of the data rather than on the raw pixels. Specifically, we perform principal component analysis and then randomly mask a subset of components, which accounts for a fixed ratio of the data variance. The learning task then amounts to reconstructing the masked components from the visible ones. Compared to local patches of pixels, the principal components of images carry more global information. We thus posit that predicting masked from visible components involves more high-level features, allowing our masking strategy to extract more useful representations. This is corroborated by our empirical findings which demonstrate improved image classification performance for component over pixel masking. Our method thus constitutes a simple and robust data-driven alternative to traditional masked image modeling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, they all require huge computational costs due to the usage of large-scale pre-trained DMs, making it difficult to conduct full evaluation under strong attacks and compare with traditional CNN-based methods. Simply reducing the network size and timesteps in DMs could significantly harm the image generation quality, which invalidates previous frameworks. To alleviate this issue, we redesign the diffusion framework from generating high-quality images to predicting distinguishable image labels. Specifically, we employ an image translation framework to learn many-to-one mapping from input samples to designed orthogonal image labels. Based on this framework, we introduce an efficient Image-to-Image diffusion classifier with a pruned U-Net structure and reduced diffusion timesteps. Besides the framework, we redesign the optimization objective of DMs to fit the target of image classification, where a new classification loss is incorporated in the DM-based image translation framework to distinguish the generated label from those of other classes. We conduct sufficient evaluations of the proposed classifier under various attacks on popular benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better adversarial robustness with fewer computational costs than DM-based and CNN-based methods.

Existing methods either require identical head counts or introduce projectors to bridge dimensional gaps, limiting flexibility and efficiency. We propose Squeezing-Heads Distillation (SHD), a novel approach that enables seamless knowledge transfer between models with varying head counts by compressing multi-head attention maps via efficient linear approximation. Unlike prior work, SHD eliminates alignment barriers without additional parameters or architectural modifications. Our method dynamically approximates the combined effect of multiple teacher heads into fewer student heads, preserving fine-grained attention patterns while reducing redundancy. Experiments across language (LLaMA, GPT) and vision (DiT, MDT) generative and vision (DeiT) discriminative tasks demonstrate SHD's effectiveness: it outperforms logit-based and feature-alignment KD baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in image classification, image generation language fine-tuning, and language pre-training. The key innovations of flexible head compression, projector-free design, and linear-time complexity make SHD a versatile and scalable solution for distilling modern transformers. This work bridges a critical gap in KD, enabling efficient deployment of compact models without compromising performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the focus of these design techniques has often overlooked critical metrics such as fairness, robustness, and generalization. As a result, when evaluating SOTA edge DNNs' performance in image classification using the FACET dataset, we found that they exhibit significant accuracy disparities (14.09%) across 10 different skin tones, alongside issues of non-robustness and poor generalizability. In response to these observations, we introduce Mixture-of-Experts-based Neural Architecture Search (MoENAS), an automatic design technique that navigates through a space of mixture of experts to discover accurate, fair, robust, and general edge DNNs. MoENAS improves the accuracy by 4.02% compared to SOTA edge DNNs and reduces the skin tone accuracy disparities from 14.09% to 5.60%, while enhancing robustness by 3.80% and minimizing overfitting to 0.21%, all while keeping model size close to state-of-the-art models average size (+0.4M). With these improvements, MoENAS establishes a new benchmark for edge DNN design, paving the way for the development of more inclusive and robust edge DNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p></details> | first version | None |

To date, one of the strongest biases observed in image classification models is texture bias-where models overly rely on texture information rather than shape information. Yet, existing approaches for measuring and mitigating texture bias have not been able to capture how textures impact model robustness in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce the Texture Association Value (TAV), a novel metric that quantifies how strongly models rely on the presence of specific textures when classifying objects. Leveraging TAV, we demonstrate that model accuracy and robustness are heavily influenced by texture. Our results show that texture bias explains the existence of natural adversarial examples, where over 90% of these samples contain textures that are misaligned with the learned texture of their true label, resulting in confident mispredictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML)</p></details> | None |

Given a set of points in a metric space, the goal of $\textsf{MDMS}$ is to maximize an objective function combining a monotone submodular utility term and a min-distance diversity term between any pair of selected points, subject to a cardinality constraint. We propose the $\texttt{GIST}$ algorithm, which achieves a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation guarantee for $\textsf{MDMS}$ by approximating a series of maximum independent set problems with a bicriteria greedy algorithm. We also prove that it is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of $0.5584$. Finally, we demonstrate that $\texttt{GIST}$ outperforms existing benchmarks for on a real-world image classification task that studies single-shot subset selection for ImageNet.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures | None |

This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

This tension is particularly significant for emerging interpretable-by-design methods, which aim to redesign ML algorithms for trustworthy interpretability but often sacrifice accuracy in the process. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating the impact of deviations in concept representations-an essential component of interpretable models-on prediction performance and propose a novel framework to mitigate these effects. The framework builds on the principle of optimizing concept embeddings under constraints that preserve interpretability. Using a generative model as a test-bed, we rigorously prove that our algorithm achieves zero loss while progressively enhancing the interpretability of the resulting model. Additionally, we evaluate the practical performance of our proposed framework in generating explainable predictions for image classification tasks across various benchmarks. Compared to existing explainable methods, our approach not only improves prediction accuracy while preserving model interpretability across various large-scale benchmarks but also achieves this with significantly lower computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers $\unicode{x2013}$ such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles $\unicode{x2013}$ directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretable predictions. To support further research, we use public datasets and will release our code and preprocessing pipeline, providing a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 Workshop on Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models</p></details> | None |

However, it faces significant challenges due to the high-dimensional nature of the data and the complex spectral-spatial relationships inherent in HSI. Traditional methods, including conventional machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often struggle to effectively capture these intricate spectral-spatial features and global contextual information. Transformer-based models, while powerful in capturing long-range dependencies, often demand substantial computational resources, posing challenges in scenarios where labeled datasets are limited, as is commonly seen in HSI applications. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes GraphMamba, a hybrid model that combines spectral-spatial token generation, graph-based token prioritization, and cross-attention mechanisms. The model introduces a novel hybridization of state-space modeling and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), capturing both linear and nonlinear spatial-spectral dynamics. GraphMamba enhances the ability to model complex spatial-spectral relationships while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency across diverse HSI datasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that GraphMamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering a scalable and robust solution for complex HSI classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Amnesia as a Catalyst for Enhancing Black Box Pixel Attacks in Image Classification and Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07821v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that query-based attacks tend to have relatively higher success rates in adversarial black-box attacks. While research on black-box attacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on pixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image classification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily depend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more suitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, query-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box attack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement Learning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget processes. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging rewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR effectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while adhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed attack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the confidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed state-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks.

The unlabeled server dataset can either be pre-existing or generated through a data-free approach. The effectiveness of this approach critically depends on the method of assigning weights to client predictions when creating pseudo-labels, especially in highly heterogeneous settings. Inspired by theoretical results from GANs, we propose a provably near-optimal weighting method that leverages client discriminators trained with a server-distributed generator and local datasets. Our experiments on various image classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines. Furthermore, we show that the additional communication cost, client-side privacy leakage, and client-side computational overhead introduced by our method are negligible, both in scenarios with and without a pre-existing server dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond Batch Learning: Global Awareness Enhanced Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06272v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domain adaptation (DA), the effectiveness of deep learning-based models is often constrained by batch learning strategies that fail to fully apprehend the global statistical and geometric characteristics of data distributions. Addressing this gap, we introduce 'Global Awareness Enhanced Domain Adaptation' (GAN-DA), a novel approach that transcends traditional batch-based limitations. GAN-DA integrates a unique predefined feature representation (PFR) to facilitate the alignment of cross-domain distributions, thereby achieving a comprehensive global statistical awareness. This representation is innovatively expanded to encompass orthogonal and common feature aspects, which enhances the unification of global manifold structures and refines decision boundaries for more effective DA. Our extensive experiments, encompassing 27 diverse cross-domain image classification tasks, demonstrate GAN-DA's remarkable superiority, outperforming 24 established DA methods by a significant margin. Furthermore, our in-depth analyses shed light on the decision-making processes, revealing insights into the adaptability and efficiency of GAN-DA. This approach not only addresses the limitations of existing DA methodologies but also sets a new benchmark in the realm of domain adaptation, offering broad implications for future research and applications in this field.</p></details> |  | None |

By integrating a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism and refining the self-attention process, the model effectively extracts both global and local features, enhancing its ability to detect lesions with ambiguous boundaries and intricate structures. Performance evaluation on the ISIC 2017 dataset demonstrates that the improved Transformer surpasses established AI models, including ResNet50, VGG19, ResNext, and Vision Transformer, across key metrics such as accuracy, AUC, F1-Score, and Precision. Grad-CAM visualizations further highlight the interpretability of the model, showcasing strong alignment between the algorithm's focus areas and actual lesion sites. This research underscores the transformative potential of advanced AI models in medical imaging, paving the way for more accurate and reliable diagnostic tools.

| **[Lightweight Dataset Pruning without Full Training via Example Difficulty and Prediction Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06905v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning rely heavily on massive datasets, leading to substantial storage and training costs. Dataset pruning aims to alleviate this demand by discarding redundant examples. However, many existing methods require training a model with a full dataset over a large number of epochs before being able to prune the dataset, which ironically makes the pruning process more expensive than just training the model on the entire dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Difficulty and Uncertainty-Aware Lightweight (DUAL) score, which aims to identify important samples from the early training stage by considering both example difficulty and prediction uncertainty. To address a catastrophic accuracy drop at an extreme pruning, we further propose a ratio-adaptive sampling using Beta distribution. Experiments on various datasets and learning scenarios such as image classification with label noise and image corruption, and model architecture generalization demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Specifically, on ImageNet-1k, our method reduces the time cost for pruning to 66% compared to previous methods while achieving a SOTA, specifically 60% test accuracy at a 90% pruning ratio. On CIFAR datasets, the time cost is reduced to just 15% while maintaining SOTA performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, leading to information silos among them, which prevents these abilities from learning from each other and collaborating effectively. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions with a single transformer. EgoAgent unifies the representational spaces of the three abilities by mapping them all into a sequence of continuous tokens. Learnable query tokens are appended to obtain current states, future states, and next actions. With joint supervision, our agent model establishes the internal relationship among these three abilities and effectively mimics the human inference and learning processes. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent covering image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained model will be released for reproducibility.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its "black box" nature imposes significant limitations, particularly in sensitive application domains. While existing interpretable machine learning methods address some of these issues, they often fail to adequately consider feature correlations and provide insufficient evaluation of model decision paths. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Real Explainer (RealExp), an interpretability computation method that decouples the Shapley Value into individual feature importance and feature correlation importance. By incorporating feature similarity computations, RealExp enhances interpretability by precisely quantifying both individual feature contributions and their interactions, leading to more reliable and nuanced explanations. Additionally, this paper proposes a novel interpretability evaluation criterion focused on elucidating the decision paths of deep learning models, going beyond traditional accuracy-based metrics. Experimental validations on two unstructured data tasks -- image classification and text sentiment analysis -- demonstrate that RealExp significantly outperforms existing methods in interpretability. Case studies further illustrate its practical value: in image classification, RealExp aids in selecting suitable pre-trained models for specific tasks from an interpretability perspective; in text classification, it enables the optimization of models and approximates the performance of a fine-tuned GPT-Ada model using traditional bag-of-words approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Elsevier for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, they struggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To investigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and identify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated. Specifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes, which we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes evident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated along with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a novel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We introduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them into a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a corresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition (MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This ensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across modalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14 dataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007 and surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training parameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3 methods on COCO and VOC</p></details> |  | None |

Despite this rapid proliferation, the trustworthiness of foundation models remains underexplored. Specifically, the out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on massive multi-modal data, have not been sufficiently addressed. The disparity between their demonstrated potential and practical reliability raises concerns regarding the safe and trustworthy deployment of foundation models. To address this gap, we evaluate and analyze the OoDD capabilities of various proprietary and open-source LVLMs. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of how these foundation models represent confidence scores through their generated natural language responses. Furthermore, we propose a self-guided prompting approach, termed Reflexive Guidance (ReGuide), aimed at enhancing the OoDD capability of LVLMs by leveraging self-generated image-adaptive concept suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that our ReGuide enhances the performance of current LVLMs in both image classification and OoDD tasks.

While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.

However, its clinical application is often hindered by data heterogeneity caused by variations in scanner vendors, imaging protocols, and operators. Approaches such as invariant risk minimization (IRM) aim to address this challenge of out-of-distribution generalization. For instance, VIRM improves upon IRM by tackling the issue of insufficient feature support overlap, demonstrating promising potential. Nonetheless, these methods face limitations in medical imaging due to the scarcity of annotated data and the inefficiency of augmentation strategies. To address these issues, we propose a novel domain-oriented direction selector to replace the random augmentation strategy used in VIRM. Our method leverages inter-domain covariance as a guider for augmentation direction, guiding data augmentation towards the target domain. This approach effectively reduces domain discrepancies and enhances generalization performance. Experiments on a multi-center diabetic retinopathy dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly under limited data conditions and significant domain heterogeneity.</p></details> |  | None |

This work evaluates the performance of Vision Transformers architectures, including Swin Transformer and MaxViT, in several datasets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. We used three training sets of images with brain, lung, and kidney tumors. Each dataset includes different classification labels, from brain gliomas and meningiomas to benign and malignant lung conditions and kidney anomalies such as cysts and cancers. This work aims to analyze the behavior of the neural networks in each dataset and the benefits of combining different image modalities and tumor classes. We designed several experiments by fine-tuning the models on combined and individual image modalities. The results revealed that the Swin Transformer provided high accuracy, achieving up to 99.9\% for kidney tumor classification and 99.3\% accuracy in a combined dataset. MaxViT also provided excellent results in individual datasets but performed poorly when data is combined. This research highlights the adaptability of Transformer-based models to various image modalities and features. However, challenges persist, including limited annotated data and interpretability issues. Future works will expand this study by incorporating other image modalities and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. Integrating these models across diverse datasets could mark a pivotal advance in precision medicine, paving the way for more efficient and comprehensive healthcare solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

Yet, neural networks are known to produce overconfident predictions for misclassified samples. As a result, it remains a problematic matter as existing confidence score functions rely on category-level signals, the logits, to detect failures. This research introduces an innovative strategy, leveraging human-level concepts for a dual purpose: to reliably detect when a model fails and to transparently interpret why. By integrating a nuanced array of signals for each category, our method enables a finer-grained assessment of the model's confidence. We present a simple yet highly effective approach based on the ordinal ranking of concept activation to the input image. Without bells and whistles, our method significantly reduce the false positive rate across diverse real-world image classification benchmarks, specifically by 3.7% on ImageNet and 9% on EuroSAT.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the inherent sample imbalance among different diseases leads algorithms biased to the majority categories, leading to poor performance for rare categories. Existing works formulated this challenge as a long-tailed problem and attempted to tackle it by decoupling the feature representation and classification. Yet, due to the imbalanced distribution and limited samples from tail classes, these works are prone to biased representation learning and insufficient classifier calibration. To tackle these problems, we propose a new Long-tailed Medical Diagnosis (LMD) framework for balanced medical image classification on long-tailed datasets. In the initial stage, we develop a Relation-aware Representation Learning (RRL) scheme to boost the representation ability by encouraging the encoder to capture intrinsic semantic features through different data augmentations. In the subsequent stage, we propose an Iterative Classifier Calibration (ICC) scheme to calibrate the classifier iteratively. This is achieved by generating a large number of balanced virtual features and fine-tuning the encoder using an Expectation-Maximization manner. The proposed ICC compensates for minority categories to facilitate unbiased classifier optimization while maintaining the diagnostic knowledge in majority classes. Comprehensive experiments on three public long-tailed medical datasets demonstrate that our LMD framework significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Among the various types of XAI methods, establishing a method of explanation based on past experience in meta-learning requires special consideration due to its bi-level structure of training, which has been left unexplored. In this work, we propose influence functions for explaining meta-learning that measure the sensitivities of training tasks to adaptation and inference. We also argue that the approximation of the Hessian using the Gauss-Newton matrix resolves computational barriers peculiar to meta-learning. We demonstrate the adequacy of the method through experiments on task distinction and task distribution distinction using image classification tasks with MAML and Prototypical Network.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages; v2: modification in metadata</p></details> | None |

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to bridge this gap by following a well-defined optimization paradigm which systematically looks for the best architecture, given objective criterion such as maximal classification accuracy. The main limitation of NAS is however its astronomical computational cost, as it typically requires training each candidate network architecture from scratch. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this limitation by proposing a novel training-free proxy for image classification accuracy based on Fisher Information. The proposed proxy has a strong theoretical background in statistics and it allows estimating expected image classification accuracy of a given deep network without training the network, thus significantly reducing computational cost of standard NAS algorithms. Our training-free proxy achieves state-of-the-art results on three public datasets and in two search spaces, both when evaluated using previously proposed metrics, as well as using a new metric that we propose which we demonstrate is more informative for practical NAS applications.

Yet, collecting annotations for large RS image archives is time-consuming and costly. To address this issue, several data augmentation methods have been introduced in RS. Among others, the data augmentation technique CutMix, which combines parts of two existing training images to generate an augmented image, stands out as a particularly effective approach. However, the direct application of CutMix in RS MLC can lead to the erasure or addition of class labels (i.e., label noise) in the augmented (i.e., combined) training image. To address this problem, we introduce a label propagation (LP) strategy that allows the effective application of CutMix in the context of MLC problems in RS without being affected by label noise. To this end, our proposed LP strategy exploits pixel-level class positional information to update the multi-label of the augmented training image. We propose to access such class positional information from reference maps associated to each training image (e.g., thematic products) or from class explanation masks provided by an explanation method if no reference maps are available. Similarly to pairing two training images, our LP strategy carries out a pairing operation on the associated pixel-level class positional information to derive the updated multi-label for the augmented image. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our LP strategy in general and its robustness in the case of various simulated and real scenarios with noisy class positional information in particular.</p></details> |  | None |

We address this problem in the scenario where we have access to images from the target domains but no annotations. Motivated by the challenges of the OOD-CV benchmark where we encounter real world Out-of-Domain (OOD) nuisances and occlusion, we introduce a novel Bayesian approach to OOD robustness for object classification. Our work extends Compositional Neural Networks (CompNets), which have been shown to be robust to occlusion but degrade badly when tested on OOD data. We exploit the fact that CompNets contain a generative head defined over feature vectors represented by von Mises-Fisher (vMF) kernels, which correspond roughly to object parts, and can be learned without supervision. We obverse that some vMF kernels are similar between different domains, while others are not. This enables us to learn a transitional dictionary of vMF kernels that are intermediate between the source and target domains and train the generative model on this dictionary using the annotations on the source domain, followed by iterative refinement. This approach, termed Unsupervised Generative Transition (UGT), performs very well in OOD scenarios even when occlusion is present. UGT is evaluated on different OOD benchmarks including the OOD-CV dataset, several popular datasets (e.g., ImageNet-C [9]), artificial image corruptions (including adding occluders), and synthetic-to-real domain transfer, and does well in all scenarios outperforming SOTA alternatives (e.g. up to 10% top-1 accuracy on Occluded OOD-CV dataset).</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional approaches typically focus on unimodal medical image data, neglecting the integration of diverse non-image patient data. This paper proposes a novel Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning (CGMCL) framework for multimodal structured data from different data domains to improve medical image classification. The model effectively integrates both image and non-image data by constructing cross-modality graphs and leveraging contrastive learning to align multimodal features in a shared latent space. An inter-modality feature scaling module further optimizes the representation learning process by reducing the gap between heterogeneous modalities. The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets: a Parkinson's disease (PD) dataset and a public melanoma dataset. Results demonstrate that CGMCL outperforms conventional unimodal methods in accuracy, interpretability, and early disease prediction. Additionally, the method shows superior performance in multi-class melanoma classification. The CGMCL framework provides valuable insights into medical image classification while offering improved disease interpretability and predictive capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To serve as effective training data, generated images must be highly realistic while also sufficiently diverse within the support of the target data distribution. Yet, state-of-the-art conditional image generation models have been primarily optimized for creative applications, prioritizing image realism and prompt adherence over conditional diversity. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the diversity of generated images with the goal of increasing their effectiveness to train downstream image classification models, without fine-tuning the image generation model. We find that conditioning the generation process on an augmented real image and text prompt produces generations that serve as effective synthetic datasets for downstream training. Conditioning on real training images contextualizes the generation process to produce images that are in-domain with the real image distribution, while data augmentations introduce visual diversity that improves the performance of the downstream classifier. We validate augmentation-conditioning on a total of five established long-tail and few-shot image classification benchmarks and show that leveraging augmentations to condition the generation process results in consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on the long-tailed benchmark and remarkable gains in extreme few-shot regimes of the remaining four benchmarks. These results constitute an important step towards effectively leveraging synthetic data for downstream training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross the Gap: Exposing the Intra-modal Misalignment in CLIP via Modality Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04263v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained multi-modal Vision-Language Models like CLIP are widely used off-the-shelf for a variety of applications. In this paper, we show that the common practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these powerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like image-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the CLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal constraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate this, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map representations from their input modality to the complementary one without any need for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show that, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval, approaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with respect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image classification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our findings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image feature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

Diagnosing EoE usually involves endoscopic inspection of the esophageal mucosa and obtaining esophageal biopsies for histologic confirmation. Recent advances have seen AI-assisted endoscopic imaging, guided by the EREFS system, emerge as a potential alternative to reduce reliance on invasive histological assessments. Despite these advancements, significant challenges persist due to the limited availability of data for training AI models - a common issue even in the development of AI for more prevalent diseases. This study seeks to improve the performance of deep learning-based EoE phenotype classification by augmenting our training data with a diverse set of images from online platforms, public datasets, and electronic textbooks increasing our dataset from 435 to 7050 images. We utilized the Data-efficient Image Transformer for image classification and incorporated attention map visualizations to boost interpretability. The findings show that our expanded dataset and model enhancements improved diagnostic accuracy, robustness, and comprehensive analysis, enhancing patient outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

Our experiments demonstrate that a 91.12% dataset size reduction can be achieved while maintaining comparable SR performance to the full dataset. We further analyze initialization strategies and distillation methods to optimize memory efficiency and computational costs. Our findings provide new insights into dataset distillation for SR and set the stage for future advancements.</p></details> |  | None |

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix</p></details> | None |
| **[Control-oriented Clustering of Visual Latent Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05063v4)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space -- the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder -- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of neural collapse (NC) in image classification (arXiv:2008.08186), we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar law of clustering in the visual representation space. Specifically, in discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels; in continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to "control-oriented" classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO). Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35%. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/ControlOriented_NC</p></details> | None |

However, color image classification is arguably still in its infancy for TMs, with CIFAR-10 being a focal point for tracking progress. Over the past few years, TM's CIFAR-10 accuracy has increased from around 61% in 2020 to 75.1% in 2023 with the introduction of Drop Clause. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed TM Composites architecture and introduce a range of TM Specialists that use various image processing techniques. These include Canny edge detection, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, adaptive mean thresholding, adaptive Gaussian thresholding, Otsu's thresholding, color thermometers, and adaptive color thermometers. In addition, we conduct a rigorous hyperparameter search, where we uncover optimal hyperparameters for several of the TM Specialists. The result is a toolbox that provides new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 for TMs with an accuracy of 82.8%. In conclusion, our toolbox of TM Specialists forms a foundation for new TM applications and a landmark for further research on TM Composites in image analysis.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

The predominant models use the so-called transformer network and have a large field of applicability, including predicting text and images, classification, and even predicting solutions to the dynamics of physical systems. Here we present a variational quantum circuit architecture named Self-Attention Sequential Quantum Transformer Channel (SASQuaTCh), which builds networks of qubits that perform analogous operations of the transformer network, namely the keystone self-attention operation, and leads to an exponential improvement in parameter complexity and run-time complexity over its classical counterpart. Our approach leverages recent insights from kernel-based operator learning in the context of predicting spatiotemporal systems to represent deep layers of a vision transformer network using simple gate operations and a set of multi-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms. To validate our approach, we consider image classification tasks in simulation and with hardware, where with only 9 qubits and a handful of parameters we are able to simultaneously embed and classify a grayscale image of handwritten digits with high accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |

Here, we investigate how task order influences continual learning and propose a strategy for optimizing it. Leveraging a linear teacher-student model with latent factors, we derive an analytical expression relating task similarity and ordering to learning performance. Our analysis reveals two principles that hold under a wide parameter range: (1) tasks should be arranged from the least representative to the most typical, and (2) adjacent tasks should be dissimilar. We validate these rules on both synthetic data and real-world image classification datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), demonstrating consistent performance improvements in both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Our work thus presents a generalizable framework for task-order optimization in task-incremental continual learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches, often based on simple data augmentation techniques or generative adversarial networks, are limited in producing realistic and varied test cases. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework for testing vision neural networks that leverages Large Language Models and control-conditioned Diffusion Models to generate synthetic, high-fidelity test cases. Our approach begins by translating images into detailed textual descriptions using a captioning model, allowing the language model to identify modifiable aspects of the image and generate counterfactual descriptions. These descriptions are then used to produce new test images through a text-to-image diffusion process that preserves spatial consistency and maintains the critical elements of the scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two datasets: ImageNet1K for image classification and SHIFT for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. The results show that our approach can generate significant test cases that reveal weaknesses and improve the robustness of the model through targeted retraining. We conducted a human assessment using Mechanical Turk to validate the generated images. The responses from the participants confirmed, with high agreement among the voters, that our approach produces valid and realistic images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods do not eliminate all dependencies/redundancies, as linearly uncorrelated variables can still exhibit nonlinear relationships. This work provides a differentiable and scalable algorithm for dependence minimization that goes beyond linear pairwise decorrelation. Our method employs an adversarial game where small networks identify dependencies among feature dimensions, while the encoder exploits this information to reduce dependencies. We provide empirical evidence of the algorithm's convergence and demonstrate its utility in three applications: extending PCA to nonlinear decorrelation, improving the generalization of image classification methods, and preventing dimensional collapse in self-supervised representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have transformed this field by providing automated and precise analysis of complex medical images. This study introduces a hybrid deep learning model that integrates a pre-trained ResNet101 with a custom CNN to classify kidney CT images into four categories: normal, stone, cyst, and tumor. The proposed model leverages feature fusion to enhance classification accuracy, achieving 99.73% training accuracy and 100% testing accuracy. Using a dataset of 12,446 CT images and advanced feature mapping techniques, the hybrid CNN model outperforms standalone ResNet101. This architecture delivers a robust and efficient solution for automated kidney disease diagnosis, providing improved precision, recall, and reduced testing time, making it highly suitable for clinical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Slowing Learning by Erasing Simple Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02820v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior work suggests that neural networks tend to learn low-order moments of the data distribution first, before moving on to higher-order correlations. In this work, we derive a novel closed-form concept erasure method, QLEACE, which surgically removes all quadratically available information about a concept from a representation. Through comparisons with linear erasure (LEACE) and two approximate forms of quadratic erasure, we explore whether networks can still learn when low-order statistics are removed from image classification datasets. We find that while LEACE consistently slows learning, quadratic erasure can exhibit both positive and negative effects on learning speed depending on the choice of dataset, model architecture, and erasure method. Use of QLEACE consistently slows learning in feedforward architectures, but more sophisticated architectures learn to use injected higher order Shannon information about class labels. Its approximate variants avoid injecting information, but surprisingly act as data augmentation techniques on some datasets, enhancing learning speed compared to LEACE.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this is highly unlikely to happen when the initial parameters are sampled randomly, which therefore often leads to the use of networks that are unnecessarily large. To address this problem, we introduce a novel parameterization of the network that restricts its weights so that a depth $d$ network produces exactly $2^d$ linear regions at initialization and maintains those regions throughout training under the parameterization. This approach allows us to learn approximations of convex, one dimensional functions that are several orders of magnitude more accurate than their randomly initialized counterparts. We further demonstrate how to extend our approach to multidimensional and non-convex functions, allowing it to replace the dense layers in other networks; preliminary improvements are shown for image classification on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.</p></details> | 24 pages, 16 figures | None |

This paper presents a dual contribution: first, a systematic analysis of current methodological practices in skin disease classification research, revealing substantial inconsistencies in data preparation, augmentation strategies, and performance reporting; second, a comprehensive training and evaluation framework demonstrated through experiments with the DINOv2-Large vision transformer across three benchmark datasets (HAM10000, DermNet, ISIC Atlas). The analysis identifies concerning patterns, including pre-split data augmentation and validation-based reporting, potentially leading to overestimated metrics, while highlighting the lack of unified methodology standards. The experimental results demonstrate DINOv2's performance in skin disease classification, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.85 (HAM10000), 0.71 (DermNet), and 0.84 (ISIC Atlas). Attention map analysis reveals critical patterns in the model's decision-making, showing sophisticated feature recognition in typical presentations but significant vulnerabilities with atypical cases and composite images. Our findings highlight the need for standardized evaluation protocols and careful implementation strategies in clinical settings. We propose comprehensive methodological recommendations for model development, evaluation, and clinical deployment, emphasizing rigorous data preparation, systematic error analysis, and specialized protocols for different image types. To promote reproducibility, we provide our implementation code through GitHub. This work establishes a foundation for rigorous evaluation standards in dermatological image classification and provides insights for responsible AI implementation in clinical dermatology.</p></details> | 60 pages, 69 figures | None |

However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |

Considerable attention has focused on diffractive networks for either spatially coherent or spatially incoherent illumination. Here we illustrate that, as opposed to imaging systems, in diffractive networks the degree of spatial coherence has a dramatic effect. In particular, we show that when the spatial coherence length on the object is comparable to the minimal feature size preserved by the optical system, neither the incoherent nor the coherent extremes serve as acceptable approximations. Importantly, this situation is inherent to many settings involving active illumination, including reflected light microscopy, autonomous vehicles and smartphones. Following this observation, we propose a general framework for training diffractive networks for any specified degree of spatial and temporal coherence, supporting all types of linear and nonlinear layers. Using our method, we numerically optimize networks for image classification, and thoroughly investigate their performance dependence on the illumination coherence properties. We further introduce the concept of coherence-blind networks, which have enhanced resilience to changes in illumination conditions. Our findings serve as a steppingstone toward adopting all-optical neural networks in real-world applications, leveraging nothing but natural light.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project's code https://github.com/matankleiner/Coherence-Awareness-in-Diffractive-Neural-Networks</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/matankleiner/Coherence-Awareness-in-Diffractive-Neural-Networks) |

Inspired by BERT's success in capturing deep bidirectional contexts in natural language processing, similar frameworks have been adapted to other modalities such as audio, with models like BEATs extending the bidirectional training paradigm to audio signals using vector quantization (VQ). However, these frameworks face challenges, notably their dependence on a single codebook for quantization, which may not capture the complex, multifaceted nature of signals. In addition, inefficiencies in codebook utilization lead to underutilized code vectors. To address these limitations, we introduce BRIDLE (Bidirectional Residual Quantization Interleaved Discrete Learning Encoder), a self-supervised encoder pretraining framework that incorporates residual quantization (RQ) into the bidirectional training process, and is generalized for pretraining with audio, image, and video. Using multiple hierarchical codebooks, RQ enables fine-grained discretization in the latent space, enhancing representation quality. BRIDLE involves an interleaved training procedure between the encoder and tokenizer. We evaluate BRIDLE on audio understanding tasks using classification benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate competitive performance on image classification and video classification tasks, showing consistent improvements over traditional VQ methods in downstream performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional machine learning algorithms rely on well-defined input and output variables; however, there are scenarios where the separation between the input and output variables and the underlying, associated input and output layers of the model are unknown. Feature Selection (FS) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have emerged as promising solutions in such scenarios. This paper proposes MICS-EFS, a Model Input-Output Configuration Search with Embedded Feature Selection. The methodology explores internal dependencies in the complete input parameter space for classification tasks involving both 1D sensor time-series and 2D image data. MICS-EFS employs a modified encoder-decoder model and the Sequential Forward Search (SFS) algorithm, combining input-output configuration search with embedded feature selection. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MICS-EFS compared to other FS algorithms. Across all tested datasets, MICS-EFS delivered an average accuracy improvement of 1.5% over baseline models, with the accuracy gains ranging from 0.5% to 5.9%. Moreover, the algorithm reduced feature dimensionality to just 2-5% of the original data, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. These results highlight the potential of MICS-EFS to improve model accuracy and efficiency in various machine learning tasks.

Various works have sought to quantify uncertainty associated with these models, detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, or identify anomalous regions in an image, but limited work has sought to develop a holistic approach that can accurately estimate perception model confidence across various sources of uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method and compare it to existing approaches for uncertainty quantification and OOD detection. We find that our method can best distinguish between correctly classified, misclassified, and OOD samples with anomalous regions, as well as between samples with visual image modifications resulting in high, medium, and low prediction accuracy. We describe how to extend our approach for anomaly localization tasks and demonstrate the ability of our approach to distinguish between regions in an image that are familiar to the perception model from those that are unfamiliar. We find that our method generates interpretable scores that most reliably capture a holistic notion of perception model confidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.06111</p></details> | None |

Common practice entails a reactive, cyclical approach: model deployment, data mining, and retraining. We instead develop a proactive longtail discovery process by imagining additional data during training. In particular, we develop general model-based longtail signals, including a differentiable, single forward pass formulation of epistemic uncertainty that does not impact model parameters or predictive performance but can flag rare or hard inputs. We leverage these signals as guidance to generate additional training data from a latent diffusion model in a process we call Longtail Guidance (LTG). Crucially, we can perform LTG without retraining the diffusion model or the predictive model, and we do not need to expose the predictive model to intermediate diffusion states. Data generated by LTG exhibit semantically meaningful variation, yield significant generalization improvements on image classification benchmarks, and can be analyzed to proactively discover, explain, and address conceptual gaps in a predictive model.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |

This paper introduces AID (Activation by Interval-wise Dropout), a novel method inspired by Dropout, designed to address plasticity loss. Unlike Dropout, AID generates subnetworks by applying Dropout with different probabilities on each preactivation interval. Theoretical analysis reveals that AID regularizes the network, promoting behavior analogous to that of deep linear networks, which do not suffer from plasticity loss. We validate the effectiveness of AID in maintaining plasticity across various benchmarks, including continual learning tasks on standard image classification datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we show that AID enhances reinforcement learning performance in the Arcade Learning Environment benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Jacobian Descent for Multi-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16232v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many optimization problems require balancing multiple conflicting objectives. As gradient descent is limited to single-objective optimization, we introduce its direct generalization: Jacobian descent (JD). This algorithm iteratively updates parameters using the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued objective function, in which each row is the gradient of an individual objective. While several methods to combine gradients already exist in the literature, they are generally hindered when the objectives conflict. In contrast, we propose projecting gradients to fully resolve conflict while ensuring that they preserve an influence proportional to their norm. We prove significantly stronger convergence guarantees with this approach, supported by our empirical results. Our method also enables instance-wise risk minimization (IWRM), a novel learning paradigm in which the loss of each training example is considered a separate objective. Applied to simple image classification tasks, IWRM exhibits promising results compared to the direct minimization of the average loss. Additionally, we outline an efficient implementation of JD using the Gramian of the Jacobian matrix to reduce time and memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 10 figures, conference</p></details> | None |
| **[A Framework for Double-Blind Federated Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01289v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of foundational models (FMs) pre-trained on large-scale data has advanced the state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks. While FMs have demonstrated good zero-shot performance on many image classification tasks, there is often scope for performance improvement by adapting the FM to the downstream task. However, the data that is required for this adaptation typically exists in silos across multiple entities (data owners) and cannot be collated at a central location due to regulations and privacy concerns. At the same time, a learning service provider (LSP) who owns the FM cannot share the model with the data owners due to proprietary reasons. In some cases, the data owners may not even have the resources to store such large FMs. Hence, there is a need for algorithms to adapt the FM in a double-blind federated manner, i.e., the data owners do not know the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see the data for the downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a framework for double-blind federated adaptation of FMs using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The proposed framework first decomposes the FM into a sequence of FHE-friendly blocks through knowledge distillation. The resulting FHE-friendly model is adapted for the downstream task via low-rank parallel adapters that can be learned without backpropagation through the FM. Since the proposed framework requires the LSP to share intermediate representations with the data owners, we design a privacy-preserving permutation scheme to prevent the data owners from learning the FM through model extraction attacks. Finally, a secure aggregation protocol is employed for federated learning of the low-rank parallel adapters. Empirical results on four datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enabling Small Models for Zero-Shot Selection and Reuse through Model Label Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11449v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot ability in image classification tasks by aligning text and images but suffer inferior performance compared with task-specific expert models. On the contrary, expert models excel in their specialized domains but lack zero-shot ability for new tasks. How to obtain both the high performance of expert models and zero-shot ability is an important research direction. In this paper, we attempt to demonstrate that by constructing a model hub and aligning models with their functionalities using model labels, new tasks can be solved in a zero-shot manner by effectively selecting and reusing models in the hub. We introduce a novel paradigm, Model Label Learning (MLL), which bridges the gap between models and their functionalities through a Semantic Directed Acyclic Graph (SDAG) and leverages an algorithm, Classification Head Combination Optimization (CHCO), to select capable models for new tasks. Compared with the foundation model paradigm, it is less costly and more scalable, i.e., the zero-shot ability grows with the sizes of the model hub. Experiments on seven real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of MLL, demonstrating that expert models can be effectively reused for zero-shot tasks. Our code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Information Bottleneck Approach to Spatial Attention Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03418v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS) restricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving natural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited computational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts as an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between information compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information constraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention module for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as input an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a variational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between the attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI between the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further restrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the continuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial attention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions of interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN structures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, fine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are interpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the experiments.

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark to evaluate the performance of classification models on small-scale, multi-class datasets. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art results; however, they often suffer from overfitting and suboptimal feature representation when applied to challenging datasets like CIFAR-10. In this paper, we propose an enhanced CNN architecture that integrates deeper convolutional blocks, batch normalization, and dropout regularization to achieve superior performance. The proposed model achieves a test accuracy of 84.95%, outperforming baseline CNN architectures. Through detailed ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhancements and analyze the hierarchical feature representations. This work highlights the potential of refined CNN architectures for tackling small-scale image classification problems effectively.</p></details> |  | None |

We identify substantial informatio loss during spike transmission, linked to temporal dependencies in traditional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron-a key factor potentially limiting SNN performance. Existing SNN architectures also underutilize modern GPUs, constrained by single-bit spike storage and isolated weight-spike operations that restrict computational efficiency. We introduce ${SpikePack}$, a neuron model designed to reduce transmission loss while preserving essential features like membrane potential reset and leaky integration. ${SpikePack}$ achieves constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexity, enabling efficient parallel processing on GPUs and also supporting serial inference on existing SNN hardware accelerators. Compatible with standard Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures, ${SpikePack}$ facilitates near-lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion across various networks. Experimental results on tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation show ${SpikePack}$ achieves significant gains in accuracy and efficiency for both directly trained and converted SNNs over state-of-the-art models. Tests on FPGA-based platforms further confirm cross-platform flexibility, delivering high performance and enhanced sparsity. By enhancing information flow and rethinking SNN-ANN integration, ${SpikePack}$ advances efficient SNN deployment across diverse hardware platforms.</p></details> |  | None |

Mamba, unlike Vision Transformers, achieves linear complexity for token interactions through a recurrent hidden state process. This sequential processing is enhanced by a parallel scan algorithm, which reduces the computational time of recurrent steps from $L$ sequential steps to $log(L)$ parallel steps with respect to the number of input tokens ($L$). In this work, we propose Fast Vision Mamba (FastVim), that further reduces the computational time of the SSM block by reducing the number of recurrent steps in Vision Mamba models while still retaining model performance. By alternately pooling tokens along image dimensions across Mamba blocks, we obtain a 2$\times$ reduction in the number of parallel steps in SSM block. Our model offers up to $72.5\%$ speedup in inference speed compared to baseline Vision Mamba models on high resolution (2048$\times$2048) images. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with dramatically improved throughput in a range of tasks such as image classification, cell perturbation prediction, segmentation, and object detection.

Forward-Forward is a new training algorithm that is more similar to what occurs in the brain, although there is a significant performance gap compared to backpropagation. In the Forward-Forward algorithm, the loss functions are placed after each layer, and the updating of a layer is done using two local forward passes and one local backward pass. Forward-Forward is in its early stages and has been designed and evaluated on simple multi-layer perceptron networks to solve image classification tasks. In this work, we have extended the use of this algorithm to a more complex and modern network, namely the Vision Transformer. Inspired by insights from contrastive learning, we have attempted to revise this algorithm, leading to the introduction of Contrastive Forward-Forward. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the baseline Forward-Forward leading to an increase of up to 10% in accuracy and boosting the convergence speed by 5 to 20 times on Vision Transformer. Furthermore, if we take Cross Entropy as the baseline loss function in backpropagation, it will be demonstrated that the proposed modifications to the baseline Forward-Forward reduce its performance gap compared to backpropagation on Vision Transformer, and even outperforms it in certain conditions, such as inaccurate supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

Increased extreme weather events associated with climate change can result in alterations to river and stream connectivity. While traditional stream flow gauges are costly to deploy and limited to large river bodies, trail camera methods are a low-cost and easily deployed alternative to collect hourly data. Image capturing, however requires stream ecologists to manually curate (select and label) tens of thousands of images per year. To improve this workflow, we developed an automated instream trail camera image classification system consisting of three parts: (1) image processing, (2) image augmentation and (3) machine learning. The image preprocessing consists of seven image quality filters, foliage-based luma variance reduction, resizing and bottom-center cropping. Images are balanced using variable amount of generative augmentation using diffusion models and then passed to a machine learning classification model in labeled form. By using the vision transformer architecture and temporal image enhancement in our framework, we are able to increase the 75% base accuracy to 90% for a new unseen site image. We make use of a dataset captured and labeled by staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection between 2018-2020. Our results indicate that a combination of temporal image processing and attention-based models are effective at classifying unseen river connectivity images.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[HyperbolicLR: Epoch insensitive learning rate scheduler](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15200v3)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes two novel learning rate schedulers -- Hyperbolic Learning Rate Scheduler (HyperbolicLR) and Exponential Hyperbolic Learning Rate Scheduler (ExpHyperbolicLR) -- to address the epoch sensitivity problem that often causes inconsistent learning curves in conventional methods. By leveraging the asymptotic behavior of hyperbolic curves, the proposed schedulers maintain more stable learning curves across varying epoch settings. Specifically, HyperbolicLR applies this property directly in the epoch-learning rate space, while ExpHyperbolicLR extends it to an exponential space. We first determine optimal hyperparameters for each scheduler on a small number of epochs, fix these hyperparameters, and then evaluate performance as the number of epochs increases. Experimental results on various deep learning tasks (e.g., image classification, time series forecasting, and operator learning) demonstrate that both HyperbolicLR and ExpHyperbolicLR achieve more consistent performance improvements than conventional schedulers as training duration grows. These findings suggest that our hyperbolic-based schedulers offer a more robust and efficient approach to deep network optimization, particularly in scenarios constrained by computational resources or time.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures | None |

While metrics such as Unlearning Accuracy (UA) and Membership Inference Attack (MIA) provide a baseline for assessing unlearning performance, they fall short of evaluating the completeness and reliability of forgetting. This is because the ground truth labels remain potential candidates within the scope of uncertainty quantification, leaving gaps in the evaluation of true forgetting. In this paper, we identify critical limitations in existing unlearning metrics and propose enhanced evaluation metrics inspired by conformal prediction. Our metrics can effectively capture the extent to which ground truth labels are excluded from the prediction set. Furthermore, we observe that many existing machine unlearning methods do not achieve satisfactory forgetting performance when evaluated with our new metrics. To address this, we propose an unlearning framework that integrates conformal prediction insights into Carlini & Wagner adversarial attack loss. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate that our enhanced metrics offer deeper insights into unlearning effectiveness, and that our unlearning framework significantly improves the forgetting quality of unlearning methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The TM is a machine learning algorithm founded on propositional logic, utilizing sub-pattern recognition expressions called clauses. The accelerator implements the coalesced TM version with convolution, and classifies booleanized images of 28$\times$28 pixels with 10 categories. A configuration with 128 clauses is used in a highly parallel architecture. Fast clause evaluation is obtained by keeping all clause weights and Tsetlin automata (TA) action signals in registers.

Recently, neural tangent kernels (NTKs) have emerged as a powerful tool to analytically study the training dynamics of wide neural networks. In this work, we take an important step towards a theoretical understanding of training dynamics of equivariant models by deriving neural tangent kernels for a broad class of equivariant architectures based on group convolutions. As a demonstration of the capabilities of our framework, we show an interesting relationship between data augmentation and group convolutional networks. Specifically, we prove that they share the same expected prediction at all training times and even off-manifold. In this sense, they have the same training dynamics. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that this still holds approximately for finite-width ensembles. By implementing equivariant NTKs for roto-translations in the plane ($G=C_{n}\ltimes\mathbb{R}^{2}$) and 3d rotations ($G=\mathrm{SO}(3)$), we show that equivariant NTKs outperform their non-equivariant counterparts as kernel predictors for histological image classification and quantum mechanical property prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages + 20 pages appendices</p></details> | None |

BiSSL formulates the pretext and downstream task objectives as the lower- and upper-level objectives in a bilevel optimization problem and serves as an intermediate training stage within the self-supervised learning pipeline. By explicitly modeling the interdependence of these training stages, BiSSL facilitates enhanced information sharing between them, ultimately leading to a backbone parameter initialization that is better aligned for the downstream task. We propose a versatile training algorithm that alternates between optimizing the two objectives defined in BiSSL, which is applicable to a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pre-train ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Visualizations of the backbone features provide further evidence that BiSSL improves the downstream task alignment of the backbone features prior to fine-tuning.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, vision-language models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, have demonstrated potential in improving diagnostic accuracy by leveraging large-scale image-text datasets. However, since CLIP was not initially designed for medical images, several CLIP-like models trained specifically on medical images have been developed. Despite their enhanced performance, issues of fairness - particularly regarding demographic attributes - remain largely unaddressed. In this study, we perform a comprehensive fairness analysis of CLIP-like models applied to X-ray image classification. We assess their performance and fairness across diverse patient demographics and disease categories using zero-shot inference and various fine-tuning techniques, including Linear Probing, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and full fine-tuning.

In this paper, we propose a continuous-time formulation of transformers. Specifically, we consider a dynamical system whose governing equation is parametrized by transformer blocks. We leverage optimal transport theory to regularize the training problem, which enhances stability in training and improves generalization of the resulting model. Moreover, we demonstrate in theory that this regularization is necessary as it promotes uniqueness and regularity of solutions. Our model is flexible in that almost any existing transformer architectures can be adopted to construct the dynamical system with only slight modifications to the existing code. We perform extensive numerical experiments on tasks motivated by natural language processing, image classification, and point cloud classification. Our experimental results show that the proposed method improves the performance of its discrete counterpart and outperforms relevant comparing models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they still require multiple trained models for ensemble inference, which eventually becomes a significant burden when the model size increases. In this paper, we propose a low-cost ensemble learning and inference, called Network Fission Ensembles (NFE), by converting a conventional network itself into a multi-exit structure. Starting from a given initial network, we first prune some of the weights to reduce the training burden. We then group the remaining weights into several sets and create multiple auxiliary paths using each set to construct multi-exits. We call this process Network Fission. Through this, multiple outputs can be obtained from a single network, which enables ensemble learning. Since this process simply changes the existing network structure to multi-exits without using additional networks, there is no extra computational burden for ensemble learning and inference. Moreover, by learning from multiple losses of all exits, the multi-exits improve performance via regularization, and high performance can be achieved even with increased network sparsity. With our simple yet effective method, we achieve significant improvement compared to existing ensemble methods.

Such shortcuts are easy-to-learn patterns from the training data that fail to generalise to new data. Examples include the use of a copyright watermark to recognise horses, snowy background to recognise huskies, or ink markings to detect malignant skin lesions. The explainable AI (XAI) community has suggested using instance-level explanations to detect shortcuts without external data, but this requires the examination of many explanations to confirm the presence of such shortcuts, making it a labour-intensive process. To address these challenges, we introduce Counterfactual Frequency (CoF) tables, a novel approach that aggregates instance-based explanations into global insights, and exposes shortcuts. The aggregation implies the need for some semantic concepts to be used in the explanations, which we solve by labelling the segments of an image. We demonstrate the utility of CoF tables across several datasets, revealing the shortcuts learned from them.</p></details> | 10 pages, 18 figures | None |

DebugAgent first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, DebugAgent extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that DebugAgent not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (Spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks such as sequential modeling and image classifications. However, integrating positional information, which is essential for capturing sequential relationships in data, remains a challenge in Spiking Transformers. In this paper, we introduce an approximate method for relative positional encoding (RPE) in Spiking Transformers, leveraging Gray Code as the foundation for our approach. We provide comprehensive proof of the method's effectiveness in partially capturing relative positional information for sequential tasks. Additionally, we extend our RPE approach by adapting it to a two-dimensional form suitable for image patch processing. We evaluate the proposed RPE methods on several tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification.

These methods aim to replace the CNN with a neuro-symbolic model consisting of the CNN, which is used as a feature extractor, and an interpretable rule-set extracted from the CNN itself. While these approaches provide interpretability through the extracted rule-set, they often compromise accuracy compared to the original CNN model. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this accuracy loss as the post-training binarization of filter activations to extract the rule-set. To address this, we propose a novel sparsity loss function that enables class-specific filter binarization during CNN training, thus minimizing information loss when extracting the rule-set. We evaluate several training strategies with our novel sparsity loss, analyzing their effectiveness and providing guidance on their appropriate use. Notably, we set a new benchmark, achieving a 9% improvement in accuracy and a 53% reduction in rule-set size on average, compared to the previous SOTA, while coming within 3% of the original CNN's accuracy. This highlights the significant potential of interpretable neuro-symbolic models as viable alternatives to black-box CNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

Although deep learning-based HSI classification methods have achieved significant advancements, existing methods still rely on manually labeled data for training, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel zero-shot hyperspectral image classification framework based on CLIP (SPECIAL), aiming to eliminate the need for manual annotations. The SPECIAL framework consists of two main stages: (1) CLIP-based pseudo-label generation, and (2) noisy label learning. In the first stage, HSI is spectrally interpolated to produce RGB bands. These bands are subsequently classified using CLIP, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that are accompanied by confidence scores. To improve the quality of these labels, we propose a scaling strategy that fuses predictions from multiple spatial scales. In the second stage, spectral information and a label refinement technique are incorporated to mitigate label noise and further enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPECIAL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot HSI classification, showing its potential for more practical applications.

| **[Multi-aspect Knowledge Distillation with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13341v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved performance on computer vision tasks. Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, we expand it to other tasks, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks. This paper demonstrates the great potential of multi-aspect knowledge distillation, and we believe it offers a promising direction for future research in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024 as Spotlight</p></details> | None |

Open-vocabulary models represent an innovative approach to image classification. Unlike traditional models, these models classify images into any set of categories specified with natural language prompts during inference. These prompts usually comprise manually crafted templates (e.g., 'a photo of a {}') that are filled in with the names of each category. This paper introduces a simple yet effective method for generating highly accurate and contextually descriptive prompts containing discriminative characteristics. Rare event detection, especially in medicine, is more challenging due to low inter-class and high intra-class variability. To address these, we propose a novel approach that uses domain-specific expert knowledge on rare events to generate customized and contextually relevant prompts, which are then used by large language models for image classification. Our zero-shot, privacy-preserving method enhances rare event classification without additional training, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE ISBI, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[QOC: Quantum On-Chip Training with Parameter Shift and Gradient Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13239v3)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) are drawing increasing research interest thanks to its potential to achieve quantum advantages on near-term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. In order to achieve scalable PQC learning, the training process needs to be offloaded to real quantum machines instead of using exponential-cost classical simulators. One common approach to obtain PQC gradients is parameter shift whose cost scales linearly with the number of qubits. We present QOC, the first experimental demonstration of practical on-chip PQC training with parameter shift. Nevertheless, we find that due to the significant quantum errors (noises) on real machines, gradients obtained from naive parameter shift have low fidelity and thus degrading the training accuracy. To this end, we further propose probabilistic gradient pruning to firstly identify gradients with potentially large errors and then remove them. Specifically, small gradients have larger relative errors than large ones, thus having a higher probability to be pruned. We perform extensive experiments with the Quantum Neural Network (QNN) benchmarks on 5 classification tasks using 5 real quantum machines. The results demonstrate that our on-chip training achieves over 90% and 60% accuracy for 2-class and 4-class image classification tasks. The probabilistic gradient pruning brings up to 7% PQC accuracy improvements over no pruning. Overall, we successfully obtain similar on-chip training accuracy compared with noise-free simulation but have much better training scalability. The QOC code is available in the TorchQuantum library.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in DAC 2022; 7 pages, 8 figures; open-source at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum) |
| **[The Linear Attention Resurrection in Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16182v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently taken computer vision by storm. However, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to high-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both global interactions and local representations while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further pre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution 384$^2$. For downstream tasks, L$^2$ViT delivers favorable performance as a backbone on object detection as well as semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

This type of data has privacy and legal restrictions that in many cases prevent it from being processed from central servers. However, in this area collaboration between different research centers, in order to create models as robust as possible, trained with the largest quantity and diversity of data available, is a critical point to be taken into account. In this sense, the application of privacy aware distributed architectures, such as federated learning arises. When applying this type of architecture, the server aggregates the different local models trained with the data of each data owner to build a global model. This point is critical and therefore it is fundamental to analyze different ways of aggregation according to the use case, taking into account the distribution of the clients, the characteristics of the model, etc. In this paper we propose a novel aggregation strategy and we apply it to a use case of cerebral magnetic resonance image classification. In this use case the aggregation function proposed manages to improve the convergence obtained over the rounds of the federated learning process in relation to different aggregation strategies classically implemented and applied.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their high computational and memory requirements pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a methodology to construct lightweight CNNs while maintaining competitive accuracy. The approach integrates two stages of training; dual-input-output model and transfer learning with progressive unfreezing. The dual-input-output model train on original and augmented datasets, enhancing robustness. Progressive unfreezing is applied to the unified model to optimize pre-learned features during fine-tuning, enabling faster convergence and improved model accuracy. The methodology was evaluated on three benchmark datasets; handwritten digit MNIST, fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. The proposed model achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99% on the handwritten digit MNIST and 89% on fashion MNIST, with only 14,862 parameters and a model size of 0.17 MB. While performance on CIFAR-10 was comparatively lower (65% with less than 20,00 parameters), the results highlight the scalability of this method. The final model demonstrated fast inference times and low latency, making it suitable for real-time applications. Future directions include exploring advanced augmentation techniques, improving architectural scalability for complex datasets, and extending the methodology to tasks beyond classification. This research underscores the potential for creating efficient, scalable, and task-specific CNNs for diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 22 figures, 6 tables, JMLR journal standard paper and to be submitted</p></details> | None |
| **[Fuzzy-aware Loss for Source-free Domain Adaptation in Visual Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15519v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free domain adaptation in visual emotion recognition (SFDA-VER) is a highly challenging task that requires adapting VER models to the target domain without relying on source data, which is of great significance for data privacy protection. However, due to the unignorable disparities between visual emotion data and traditional image classification data, existing SFDA methods perform poorly on this task. In this paper, we investigate the SFDA-VER task from a fuzzy perspective and identify two key issues: fuzzy emotion labels and fuzzy pseudo-labels. These issues arise from the inherent uncertainty of emotion annotations and the potential mispredictions in pseudo-labels. To address these issues, we propose a novel fuzzy-aware loss (FAL) to enable the VER model to better learn and adapt to new domains under fuzzy labels. Specifically, FAL modifies the standard cross entropy loss and focuses on adjusting the losses of non-predicted categories, which prevents a large number of uncertain or incorrect predictions from overwhelming the VER model during adaptation. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of FAL and prove its robustness in handling the noise in generated pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on 26 domain adaptation sub-tasks across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

Using unlabeled test data, continuous test-time adaptation (CTTA) directly adjusts a pre-trained source discriminative model to these changing domains. A highly effective CTTA method involves applying layer-wise adaptive learning rates for selectively adapting pre-trained layers. However, it suffers from the poor estimation of domain shift and the inaccuracies arising from the pseudo-labels. This work aims to overcome these limitations by identifying layers for adaptation via quantifying model prediction uncertainty without relying on pseudo-labels. We utilize the magnitude of gradients as a metric, calculated by backpropagating the KL divergence between the softmax output and a uniform distribution, to select layers for further adaptation. Subsequently, for the parameters exclusively belonging to these selected layers, with the remaining ones frozen, we evaluate their sensitivity to approximate the domain shift and adjust their learning rates accordingly. We conduct extensive image classification experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C, demonstrating the superior efficacy of our method compared to prior approaches.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |

By leveraging the concise knowledge embedded in the class probabilities from a pre-trained model for both clean and adversarial image classification, we propose a Pre-trained Model-guided Adversarial Federated Learning (PM-AFL) training paradigm. This paradigm integrates vanilla mixture and adversarial mixture knowledge distillation to effectively balance accuracy and robustness while promoting local models to learn from diverse data. Specifically, for clean accuracy, we adopt a dual distillation strategy where the class probabilities of randomly paired images and their blended versions are aligned between the teacher model and the local models. For adversarial robustness, we use a similar distillation approach but replace clean samples on the local side with adversarial examples. Moreover, considering the bias between local and global models, we also incorporate a consistency regularization term to ensure that local adversarial predictions stay aligned with their corresponding global clean ones. These strategies collectively enable local models to absorb diverse knowledge from the teacher model while maintaining close alignment with the global model, thereby mitigating overfitting to local optima and enhancing the generalization of the global model. Experiments demonstrate that the PM-AFL-based paradigm outperforms other methods that integrate defense strategies by a notable margin.</p></details> |  | None |

This grid search requirement has several key disadvantages: the search is computationally expensive, requires carving out a validation set that reduces the size of available data for model training, and requires practitioners to specify candidate values. In this paper, we propose an alternative to grid search: directly learning regularization hyperparameters on the full training set via model selection techniques based on the evidence lower bound ("ELBo") objective from variational methods. For deep neural networks with millions of parameters, we specifically recommend a modified ELBo that upweights the influence of the data likelihood relative to the prior while remaining a valid bound on the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Our proposed technique overcomes all three disadvantages of grid search. We demonstrate effectiveness on image classification tasks on several datasets, yielding heldout accuracy comparable to existing approaches with far less compute time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feasible Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14912v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Feasible Learning (FL), a sample-centric learning paradigm where models are trained by solving a feasibility problem that bounds the loss for each training sample. In contrast to the ubiquitous Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework, which optimizes for average performance, FL demands satisfactory performance on every individual data point. Since any model that meets the prescribed performance threshold is a valid FL solution, the choice of optimization algorithm and its dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the properties of the resulting solutions. In particular, we study a primal-dual approach which dynamically re-weights the importance of each sample during training. To address the challenge of setting a meaningful threshold in practice, we introduce a relaxation of FL that incorporates slack variables of minimal norm. Our empirical analysis, spanning image classification, age regression, and preference optimization in large language models, demonstrates that models trained via FL can learn from data while displaying improved tail behavior compared to ERM, with only a marginal impact on average performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AISTATS 2025.

The results demonstrate the significant potential of these pre-trained models when transferred for medical image classification.

Our approach builds on Neural Turing Machines and Token Turing Machines, which were applied to NLP and sequential visual understanding tasks. ViTTMs are designed for non-sequential computer vision tasks such as image classification and segmentation. Our model creates two sets of tokens: process tokens and memory tokens; process tokens pass through encoder blocks and read-write from memory tokens at each encoder block in the network, allowing them to store and retrieve information from memory. By ensuring that there are fewer process tokens than memory tokens, we are able to reduce the inference time of the network while maintaining its accuracy. On ImageNet-1K, the state-of-the-art ViT-B has median latency of 529.5ms and 81.0% accuracy, while our ViTTM-B is 56% faster (234.1ms), with 2.4 times fewer FLOPs, with an accuracy of 82.9%. On ADE20K semantic segmentation, ViT-B achieves 45.65mIoU at 13.8 frame-per-second (FPS) whereas our ViTTM-B model acheives a 45.17 mIoU with 26.8 FPS (+94%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

In the literature of FSL, deep models are trained in a manner of metric learning to provide metric in a feature space which is well generalizable to classify samples of novel classes; in the space, even a few amount of labeled training examples can construct an effective classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel FSL loss based on \emph{geometric mean} to embed discriminative metric into deep features. In contrast to the other losses such as utilizing arithmetic mean in softmax-based formulation, the proposed method leverages geometric mean to aggregate pair-wise relationships among samples for enhancing discriminative metric across class categories. The proposed loss is not only formulated in a simple form but also is thoroughly analyzed in theoretical ways to reveal its favorable characteristics which are favorable for learning feature metric in FSL. In the experiments on few-shot image classification tasks, the method produces competitive performance in comparison to the other losses.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the large volume of data can pose challenges during processing. Typically, adjacent bands in hyperspectral data are highly correlated, leading to the use of only a few selected bands for various applications. In this work, we present a correlation-based band selection approach for hyperspectral image classification. Our approach calculates the average correlation between bands using correlation coefficients to identify the relationships among different bands. Afterward, we select a subset of bands by analyzing the average correlation and applying a threshold-based method. This allows us to isolate and retain bands that exhibit lower inter-band dependencies, ensuring that the selected bands provide diverse and non-redundant information. We evaluate our proposed approach on two standard benchmark datasets: Pavia University (PA) and Salinas Valley (SA), focusing on image classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method performs competitively with other standard band selection approaches.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure | None |

Consequently, estimating the reasoning of the system provides additional information. For this, Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is one of the methods in eXplainable Machine Learning (XML). Its purpose is to provide contributions of any neural network output in the domain of its input. The main drawback of current methods is mainly due to division by small values. To overcome this problem, we provide a new definition called Relative LRP where the classical conservation law is satisfied up to a multiplicative factor but without divisions by small values except for Resnet skip connection. In this article, we will focus on image classification. This allows us to visualize the contributions of a pixel to the predictions of a multi-layer neural network. Pixel contributions provide a focus to further analysis on regions of potential interest. R-LRP can be applied for any dense, CNN or residual neural networks. Moreover, R-LRP doesn't need any hyperparameters to tune contrary to other LRP methods. We then compare the R-LRP method on different datasets with simple CNN, VGG16, VGG19 and Resnet50 networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.14501, arXiv:1605.01713 by other authors</p></details> | None |

However, a key limitation of MIL lies in the underexplored potential of pre-training the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches train it from scratch, resulting in performance heavily dependent on the number of labeled WSIs, while overlooking the abundance of unlabeled WSIs available in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating HIPT into PreMix achieves an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training datasets and label sizes. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

The platform uses a Reinforcement Learning agent to add minimum distortion to input images while still causing misclassification by the target model. The agent uses a novel dual-action method to explore the input image at each step to identify sensitive regions for adding distortions while removing noises that have less impact on the target model. This dual action leads to faster and more efficient convergence of the attack. The platform can also be used to measure the robustness of image classification models against specific distortion types. Also, retraining the model with adversarial samples significantly improved robustness when evaluated on benchmark datasets. The proposed platform outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average number of queries required to cause misclassification.

While existing methods often focus on overall accuracy or accuracy for tail classes, they overlook a critical aspect: certain types of errors can carry greater risks than others in real-world long-tailed problems. For example, misclassifying patients (a tail class) as healthy individuals (a head class) entails far more serious consequences than the reverse scenario. To address this critical issue, we introduce Making Reliable and Flexible Decisions in Long-tailed Classification (RF-DLC), a novel framework aimed at reliable predictions in long-tailed problems. Leveraging Bayesian Decision Theory, we introduce an integrated gain to seamlessly combine long-tailed data distributions and the decision-making procedure. We further propose an efficient variational optimization strategy for the decision risk objective. Our method adapts readily to diverse utility matrices, which can be designed for specific tasks, ensuring its flexibility for different problem settings. In empirical evaluation, we design a new metric, False Head Rate, to quantify tail-sensitivity risk, along with comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world tasks, including large-scale image classification and uncertainty quantification, to demonstrate the reliability and flexibility of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SIDDA: SInkhorn Dynamic Domain Adaptation for Image Classification with Equivariant Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14048v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. code available at: https://github.com/deepskies/SIDDA</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/deepskies/SIDDA) |

Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.</p></details> |  | None |

When applied to vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), existing VR approaches follow the same pipeline used in vision models (e.g., ResNet, ViT), where ground-truth class labels are inserted into fixed text templates to guide the optimization of VR patterns. This label-based approach, however, overlooks the rich information and diverse attribute-guided textual representations that CLIP can exploit, which may lead to the misclassification of samples. In this paper, we propose Attribute-based Visual Reprogramming (AttrVR) for CLIP, utilizing descriptive attributes (DesAttrs) and distinctive attributes (DistAttrs), which respectively represent common and unique feature descriptions for different classes. Besides, as images of the same class may reflect different attributes after VR, AttrVR iteratively refines patterns using the $k$-nearest DesAttrs and DistAttrs for each image sample, enabling more dynamic and sample-specific optimization. Theoretically, AttrVR is shown to reduce intra-class variance and increase inter-class separation. Empirically, it achieves superior performance in 12 downstream tasks for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP. The success of AttrVR facilitates more effective integration of VR from unimodal vision models into vision-language models.

| **[Rethinking Pre-Trained Feature Extractor Selection in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01167v4)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a preferred method for gigapixel whole slide image (WSI) classification without requiring patch-level annotations. Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset; 2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We hope that these insights can provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of the current SOTA pathology foundation models. Furthermore, this work may inform the development of more effective pathology foundation models.

Real-world datasets often contain a mix of in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) instance-dependent label noise, a challenge that is rarely addressed simultaneously by existing methods and is further compounded by the lack of comprehensive benchmarking datasets. Furthermore, even though current noisy-label learning approaches attempt to find noisy-label samples during training, these methods do not aim to estimate ID and OOD noise rates to promote their effectiveness in the selection of such noisy-label samples, and they are often represented by inefficient multi-stage learning algorithms. We propose the Adaptive Estimation of Instance-Dependent In-Distribution and Out-of-Distribution Label Noise (AEON) approach to address these research gaps. AEON is an efficient one-stage noisy-label learning methodology that dynamically estimates instance-dependent ID and OOD label noise rates to enhance robustness to complex noise settings. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark reflecting real-world ID and OOD noise scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AEON achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets</p></details> | In Submission | None |

FHE enables computation directly on encrypted data, safeguarding the entire machine learning pipeline, including data and model confidentiality. However, existing FHE-based implementations for deep neural networks face significant challenges in computational cost, latency, and scalability, limiting their practical deployment. This paper introduces DCT-CryptoNets, a novel approach that operates directly in the frequency-domain to reduce the burden of computationally expensive non-linear activations and homomorphic bootstrap operations during private inference. It does so by utilizing the discrete cosine transform (DCT), commonly employed in JPEG encoding, which has inherent compatibility with remote computing services where images are generally stored and transmitted in this encoded format. DCT-CryptoNets demonstrates a substantial latency reductions of up to 5.3$\times$ compared to prior work on benchmark image classification tasks. Notably, it demonstrates inference on the ImageNet dataset within 2.5 hours (down from 12.5 hours on equivalent 96-thread compute resources). Furthermore, by learning perceptually salient low-frequency information DCT-CryptoNets improves the reliability of encrypted predictions compared to RGB-based networks by reducing error accumulating homomorphic bootstrap operations. DCT-CryptoNets also demonstrates superior scalability to RGB-based networks by further reducing computational cost as image size increases. This study demonstrates a promising avenue for achieving efficient and practical private inference of deep learning models on high resolution images seen in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; 10 pages content, 5 pages appendix, 4 figures, 9 tables; Code @ https://github.com/ar-roy/dct-cryptonets</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ar-roy/dct-cryptonets) |

Yet, despite often facing limited data availability when working with medical images, it is frequently underutilized. This appears to come from a gap in our collective understanding of the efficacy of different augmentation techniques across different tasks and modalities. One modality where this is especially true is ultrasound imaging. This work addresses this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of different augmentation techniques at improving model performance across a wide range of ultrasound image analysis tasks. To achieve this, we introduce a new standardized benchmark of 14 ultrasound image classification and semantic segmentation tasks from 10 different sources and covering 11 body regions. Our results demonstrate that many of the augmentations commonly used for tasks on natural images are also effective on ultrasound images, even more so than augmentations developed specifically for ultrasound images in some cases. We also show that diverse augmentation using TrivialAugment, which is widely used for natural images, is also effective for ultrasound images. Moreover, our proposed methodology represents a structured approach for assessing various data augmentations that can be applied to other contexts and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated source code see https://github.com/adamtupper/ultrasound-augmentation</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/adamtupper/ultrasound-augmentation) |

This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.

| **[Estimating the Conformal Prediction Threshold from Noisy Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12749v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal Prediction (CP) is a method to control prediction uncertainty by producing a small prediction set, ensuring a predetermined probability that the true class lies within this set. This is commonly done by defining a score, based on the model predictions, and setting a threshold on this score using a validation set. In this study, we address the problem of CP calibration when we only have access to a validation set with noisy labels. We show how we can estimate the noise-free conformal threshold based on the noisy labeled data. Our solution is flexible and can accommodate various modeling assumptions regarding the label contamination process, without needing any information about the underlying data distribution or the internal mechanisms of the machine learning classifier. We develop a coverage guarantee for uniform noise that is effective even in tasks with a large number of classes. We dub our approach Noise-Aware Conformal Prediction (NACP) and show on several natural and medical image classification datasets, including ImageNet, that it significantly outperforms current noisy label methods and achieves results comparable to those obtained with a clean validation set.</p></details> |  | None |

While CLIP has demonstrated impressive capabilities in general computer vision tasks, its direct application to manufacturing inspection presents challenges due to the domain gap between its training data and industrial applications. We evaluate CLIP's effectiveness through five case studies: metallic pan surface inspection, 3D printing extrusion profile analysis, stochastic textured surface evaluation, automotive assembly inspection, and microstructure image classification. Our results show that CLIP can achieve high classification accuracy with relatively small learning sets (50-100 examples per class) for single-component and texture-based applications. However, the performance degrades with complex multi-component scenes. We provide a practical implementation framework that enables quality engineers to quickly assess CLIP's suitability for their specific applications before pursuing more complex solutions. This work establishes CLIP-based few-shot learning as an effective baseline approach that balances implementation simplicity with robust performance, demonstrated in several manufacturing quality control applications.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures | None |

We hypothesize that a single segmentation model usually used for coastline detection is insufficient to characterize different coastline types. We demonstrate that the need for a two-stage workflow prevails through different compression levels of these images. Our results from experiments using a combination of CNN and U-Net models on Sentinel-1 images show that the two-stage workflow, coastline classification-extraction from SAR images (CCESAR) outperforms a single U-Net segmentation model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CBVLM: Training-free Explainable Concept-based Large Vision Language Models for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12266v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

It is a kind of cancer that develops when the tissues of the breast grow rapidly and unboundly. This fatality rate can be prevented if the cancer is detected before it gets malignant. Using automation for early-age detection of breast cancer, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies can be implemented for the best outcome. In this study, we are using the Breast Cancer Image Classification dataset collected from the Kaggle depository, which comprises 9248 Breast Ultrasound Images and is classified into three categories: Benign, Malignant, and Normal which refers to non-cancerous, cancerous, and normal images.This research introduces three pretrained model featuring custom classifiers that includes ResNet50, MobileNet, and VGG16, along with a custom CNN model utilizing the ReLU activation function.The models ResNet50, MobileNet, VGG16, and a custom CNN recorded accuracies of 98.41%, 97.91%, 98.19%, and 92.94% on the dataset, correspondingly, with ResNet50 achieving the highest accuracy of 98.41%.This model, with its deep and powerful architecture, is particularly successful in detecting aberrant cells as well as cancerous or non-cancerous tumors. These accuracies show that the Machine Learning methods are more compatible for the classification and early detection of breast cancer.</p></details> |  | None |

These difficulties can be overcome by employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard embedded platforms and camera sensors. In this work, we address the critical need for accurate and timely disaster detection by enabling onboard aerial imagery processing and avoiding connectivity, privacy, and latency issues despite the challenges posed by limited onboard hardware resources. We propose a UAV-assisted edge framework for real-time disaster management, leveraging our proposed model optimized for real-time aerial image classification. The optimization of the model employs post-training quantization techniques. For real-world disaster scenarios, we introduce a novel dataset, DisasterEye, featuring UAV-captured disaster scenes as well as ground-level images taken by individuals on-site. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving high accuracy with reduced inference latency and memory usage on resource-constrained devices. The framework's scalability and adaptability make it a robust solution for real-time disaster detection on resource-limited UAV platforms.</p></details> |  | None |

There is very little control over the latent vector as using the random latent vector for generation will lead to trivial outputs. This work tries to address this issue by using the LatentGAN generator to directly learn to approximate the latent distribution of the autoencoder and show meaningful results on MNIST, 3D Chair, and CelebA datasets, an additional information-theoretic constrain is used which successfully learns to control autoencoder latent distribution. With this, our model also achieves an error rate of 2.38 on MNIST unsupervised image classification, which is better as compared to InfoGAN and AAE.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Based on Explanation-Guided Pruning for Remote Sensing Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11493v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm, where multiple clients collaboratively train a global model by exchanging only model updates with the central server without sharing the local data of clients. Due to the large volume of model updates required to be transmitted between clients and the central server, most FL systems are associated with high transfer costs (i.e., communication overhead). This issue is more critical for operational applications in remote sensing (RS), especially when large-scale RS data is processed and analyzed through FL systems with restricted communication bandwidth. To address this issue, we introduce an explanation-guided pruning strategy for communication-efficient FL in the context of RS image classification. Our pruning strategy is defined based on the layerwise relevance propagation (LRP) driven explanations to: 1) efficiently and effectively identify the most relevant and informative model parameters (to be exchanged between clients and the central server); and 2) eliminate the non-informative ones to minimize the volume of model updates. The experimental results on the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset demonstrate that our strategy effectively reduces the number of shared model updates, while increasing the generalization ability of the global model.

However, applying the CLIP inference in zero-shot classification, particularly for medical image diagnosis, faces challenges due to: 1) the inadequacy of representing image classes solely with single category names; 2) the modal gap between the visual and text spaces generated by CLIP encoders. Despite attempts to enrich disease descriptions with large language models, the lack of class-specific knowledge often leads to poor performance. In addition, empirical evidence suggests that existing proxy learning methods for zero-shot image classification on natural image datasets exhibit instability when applied to medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Knowledge Proxy Learning (KPL) to mine knowledge from CLIP. KPL is designed to leverage CLIP's multimodal understandings for medical image classification through Text Proxy Optimization and Multimodal Proxy Learning. Specifically, KPL retrieves image-relevant knowledge descriptions from the constructed knowledge-enhanced base to enrich semantic text proxies. It then harnesses input images and these descriptions, encoded via CLIP, to stably generate multimodal proxies that boost the zero-shot classification performance. Extensive experiments conducted on both medical and natural image datasets demonstrate that KPL enables effective zero-shot image classification, outperforming all baselines. These findings highlight the great potential in this paradigm of mining knowledge from CLIP for medical image classification and broader areas.</p></details> | AAAI(Oral) | None |

Learning good spatial representations is a fundamental problem for various downstream applications such as species distribution modeling, weather forecasting, trajectory generation, geographic question answering, etc. Even though SRL has become the foundation of almost all geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) research, we have not yet seen significant efforts to develop an extensive deep learning framework and benchmark to support SRL model development and evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose TorchSpatial, a learning framework and benchmark for location (point) encoding, which is one of the most fundamental data types of spatial representation learning. TorchSpatial contains three key components: 1) a unified location encoding framework that consolidates 15 commonly recognized location encoders, ensuring scalability and reproducibility of the implementations; 2) the LocBench benchmark tasks encompassing 7 geo-aware image classification and 10 geo-aware image regression datasets; 3) a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics to quantify geo-aware model's overall performance as well as their geographic bias, with a novel Geo-Bias Score metric. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and insights into the model performance and geographic bias of different location encoders. We believe TorchSpatial will foster future advancement of spatial representation learning and spatial fairness in GeoAI research.

A significant challenge for these classifiers emerges when they encounter images from generative models that are not represented in their training data, usually resulting in diminished performance. A typical approach is to periodically update the classifier's training data with images from the new generative models then retrain the classifier on the updated dataset. However, in some real-life scenarios, storage, computational, or privacy constraints render this approach impractical. Additionally, models used in security applications may be required to rapidly adapt. In these circumstances, continual learning provides a promising alternative, as the classifier can be updated without retraining on the entire dataset. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset called CLOFAI (Continual Learning On Fake and Authentic Images), which takes the form of a domain-incremental image classification problem. Moreover, we showcase the applicability of this dataset as a benchmark for evaluating continual learning methodologies. In doing this, we set a baseline on our novel dataset using three foundational continual learning methods -- EWC, GEM, and Experience Replay -- and find that EWC performs poorly, while GEM and Experience Replay show promise, performing significantly better than a Naive baseline.

However, limited attention has been given to utilizing explainability methods to improve model performance. In this paper, we propose to leverage counterfactual concepts aiming to enhance the performance of CNN models in image classification tasks. Our proposed approach utilizes counterfactual reasoning to identify crucial filters used in the decision-making process. Following this, we perform model retraining through the design of a novel methodology and loss functions that encourage the activation of class-relevant important filters and discourage the activation of irrelevant filters for each class. This process effectively minimizes the deviation of activation patterns of local predictions and the global activation patterns of their respective inferred classes. By incorporating counterfactual explanations, we validate unseen model predictions and identify misclassifications. The proposed methodology provides insights into potential weaknesses and biases in the model's learning process, enabling targeted improvements and enhanced performance. Experimental results on publicly available datasets have demonstrated an improvement of 1-2\%, validating the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under consideration for publication in Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> | None |

Transferring CLIP to downstream tasks (e.g. zero- or few-shot classification) is a hot topic in multimodal learning. However, current studies primarily focus on either prompt learning for text or adapter tuning for vision, without fully exploiting the complementary information and correlations among image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose an Image Description Enhanced CLIP-Adapter (IDEA) method to adapt CLIP to few-shot image classification tasks. This method captures fine-grained features by leveraging both visual features and textual descriptions of images. IDEA is a training-free method for CLIP, and it can be comparable to or even exceeds state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce Trainable-IDEA (T-IDEA), which extends IDEA by adding two lightweight learnable components (i.e., a projector and a learnable latent space), further enhancing the model's performance and achieving SOTA results on 11 datasets. As one important contribution, we employ the Llama model and design a comprehensive pipeline to generate textual descriptions for images of 11 datasets, resulting in a total of 1,637,795 image-text pairs, named "IMD-11".

To reduce the number of communication links, every worker in Q-GADMM communicates only with two neighbors, while updating its model via the group alternating direction method of multipliers (GADMM). Moreover, each worker transmits the quantized difference between its current model and its previously quantized model, thereby decreasing the communication payload size. However, due to the lack of centralized entity in decentralized ML, the spatial sparsity and payload compression may incur error propagation, hindering model training convergence. To overcome this, we develop a novel stochastic quantization method to adaptively adjust model quantization levels and their probabilities, while proving the convergence of Q-GADMM for convex objective functions. Furthermore, to demonstrate the feasibility of Q-GADMM for non-convex and stochastic problems, we propose quantized stochastic GADMM (Q-SGADMM) that incorporates deep neural network architectures and stochastic sampling. Simulation results corroborate that Q-GADMM significantly outperforms GADMM in terms of communication efficiency while achieving the same accuracy and convergence speed for a linear regression task. Similarly, for an image classification task using DNN, Q-SGADMM achieves significantly less total communication cost with identical accuracy and convergence speed compared to its counterpart without quantization, i.e., stochastic GADMM (SGADMM).</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures; to appear in IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> | None |

Recent researches have explored the use of In-Context Learning (ICL) to overcome these challenges by providing a set of demonstrating examples as context to augment MLLMs performance in several tasks, showing that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL. However, the reliance on numerous demonstrating examples and the limited MLLMs context windows presents significant obstacles. This paper aims to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Visual RAG, that synergically combines the MLLMs capability to learn from the context, with a retrieval mechanism. The crux of this approach is to ensure to augment the MLLM knowledge by selecting only the most relevant demonstrating examples for the query, pushing it to learn by analogy. In this way, relying on the new information provided dynamically during inference time, the resulting system is not limited to the knowledge extracted from the training data, but can be updated rapidly and easily without fine-tuning. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the computational costs for improving the model image classification performance, and augments the model knowledge to new visual domains and tasks it was not trained for. Extensive experiments on eight different datasets in the state of the art spanning several domains and image classification tasks show that the proposed Visual RAG, compared to the most recent state of the art (i.e., many-shot ICL), is able to obtain an accuracy that is very close or even higher (approx. +2% improvement on average) while using a much smaller set of demonstrating examples (approx. only 23% on average).</p></details> |  | None |

Initially, the model attains a 53.33% accuracy on clean images. When subjected to FGSM perturbations, its overall accuracy remains unchanged; however, the model's confidence in incorrect predictions notably increases.

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

HyperCam leverages hyperdimensional computing to perform training and inference efficiently on low-power microcontrollers. We implement a low-power wireless camera platform using off-the-shelf hardware and demonstrate that HyperCam can achieve an accuracy of 93.60%, 84.06%, 92.98%, and 72.79% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Face Detection, and Face Identification tasks, respectively, while significantly outperforming other classifiers in resource efficiency.

However, existing SSM conceptualizations retain deeply rooted biases from their roots in natural language processing. This constrains their ability to appropriately model the spatially-dependent characteristics of visual inputs. In this paper, we address these limitations by re-deriving modern selective state-space techniques, starting from a natively multidimensional formulation. Currently, prior works attempt to apply natively 1D SSMs to 2D data (i.e. images) by relying on arbitrary combinations of 1D scan directions to capture spatial dependencies. In contrast, Mamba2D improves upon this with a single 2D scan direction that factors in both dimensions of the input natively, effectively modelling spatial dependencies when constructing hidden states. Mamba2D shows comparable performance to prior adaptations of SSMs for vision tasks, on standard image classification evaluations with the ImageNet-1K dataset.

We evaluate both accuracy and calibration metrics, focusing on Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE). Our work compares different methods for building simple yet efficient classifier ensembles, including majority voting and several metamodel-based approaches. Our evaluation reveals that while state-of-the-art deep neural networks for image classification achieve high accuracy on standard datasets, they frequently suffer from significant calibration errors. Basic ensemble techniques like majority voting provide modest improvements, while metamodel-based ensembles consistently reduce ECE and MCE across all architectures. Notably, the largest of our compared metamodels demonstrate the most substantial calibration improvements, with minimal impact on accuracy. Moreover, classifier ensembles with metamodels outperform traditional model ensembles in calibration performance, while requiring significantly fewer parameters. In comparison to traditional post-hoc calibration methods, our approach removes the need for a separate calibration dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our proposed metamodel-based classifier ensembles as an efficient and effective approach to improving model calibration, thereby contributing to more reliable deep learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP), 2025</p></details> | None |

Although the amount of information varies across images, most image tokenizers only support fixed-length tokenization, leading to inefficiency in token allocation. In this study, we introduce One-D-Piece, a discrete image tokenizer designed for variable-length tokenization, achieving quality-controllable mechanism. To enable variable compression rate, we introduce a simple but effective regularization mechanism named "Tail Token Drop" into discrete one-dimensional image tokenizers. This method encourages critical information to concentrate at the head of the token sequence, enabling support of variadic tokenization, while preserving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. We evaluate our tokenizer across multiple reconstruction quality metrics and find that it delivers significantly better perceptual quality than existing quality-controllable compression methods, including JPEG and WebP, at smaller byte sizes. Furthermore, we assess our tokenizer on various downstream computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation, confirming its adaptability to numerous applications compared to other variable-rate methods. Our approach demonstrates the versatility of variable-length discrete image tokenization, establishing a new paradigm in both compression efficiency and reconstruction performance. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of tail token drop via detailed analysis of tokenizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our P...</summary><p>Our Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/one-d-piece-tokenizer</p></details> | [Code Link](https://turingmotors.github.io/one-d-piece-tokenizer) |

This collaborative yet privacy-preserving training comes at a cost. FL developers face significant challenges in attributing global model predictions to specific clients. Localizing responsible clients is a crucial step towards (a) excluding clients primarily responsible for incorrect predictions and (b) encouraging clients who contributed high-quality models to continue participating in the future. Existing ML debugging approaches are inherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized training. We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism that identifies clients responsible for a global model's prediction by tracking the flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since inference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the global model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global model's neurons in a given prediction, identifying the most crucial neurons in the global model. It then maps them to the corresponding neurons in every participating client to determine each client's contribution, ultimately localizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets, including two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks, including advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in localizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text classification tasks. At a time when state-of-the-artML debugging approaches are mostly domain-specific (e.g., image classification only), TraceFL is the first technique to enable highly accurate automated reasoning across a wide range of FL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/ACM 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)</p></details> | None |

Such properties are ubiquitous in biomedical images, which often lack explicit orientation. While current work largely relies on data augmentation or explicit modules to capture orientation information, this comes at the expense of increased training costs or ineffective approximations of the desired equivariance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient implementation of the Symmetric Rotation-Equivariant (SRE) Convolution (SRE-Conv) kernel, designed to learn rotation-invariant features while simultaneously compressing the model size. The SRE-Conv kernel can easily be incorporated into any CNN backbone. We validate the ability of a deep SRE-CNN to capture equivariance to rotation using the public MedMNISTv2 dataset (16 total tasks). SRE-Conv-CNN demonstrated improved rotated image classification performance accuracy on all 16 test datasets in both 2D and 3D images, all while increasing efficiency with fewer parameters and reduced memory footprint.

| **[Practical Continual Forgetting for Pre-trained Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09705v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For privacy and security concerns, the need to erase unwanted information from pre-trained vision models is becoming evident nowadays. In real-world scenarios, erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model owners, and these requests usually form a sequence. Therefore, under such a setting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a pre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as continual forgetting and identify three key challenges. (i) For unwanted knowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining knowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal. (iii) In real-world scenarios, the training samples may be scarce or partially missing during the process of forgetting. To address them, we first propose Group Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we introduce LoRA modules to fine-tune the FFN layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting task independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is adopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out the others. To further extend GS-LoRA to more practical scenarios, we incorporate prototype information as additional supervision and introduce a more practical approach, GS-LoRA++. For each forgotten class, we move the logits away from its original prototype. For the remaining classes, we pull the logits closer to their respective prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments on face recognition, object detection and image classification and demonstrate that our method manages to forget specific classes with minimal impact on other classes.

| **[Enhancing Few-Shot Image Classification through Learnable Multi-Scale Embedding and Attention Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07989v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of few-shot classification, the goal is to train a classifier using a limited number of samples while maintaining satisfactory performance. However, traditional metric-based methods exhibit certain limitations in achieving this objective. These methods typically rely on a single distance value between the query feature and support feature, thereby overlooking the contribution of shallow features. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach in this paper. Our approach involves utilizing a multi-output embedding network that maps samples into distinct feature spaces. The proposed method extracts feature vectors at different stages, enabling the model to capture both global and abstract features. By utilizing these diverse feature spaces, our model enhances its performance. Moreover, employing a self-attention mechanism improves the refinement of features at each stage, leading to even more robust representations and improved overall performance. Furthermore, assigning learnable weights to each stage significantly improved performance and results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on the MiniImageNet and FC100 datasets, specifically in the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot scenarios. Additionally, we performed cross-domain tasks across eight benchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy in the testing domains. These evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. https://github.com/FatemehAskari/MSENet</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/FatemehAskari/MSENet) |

The collection and annotation of these datasets is not only extremely expensive but also faces legal and privacy problems. These factors are a significant limitation for many real-world applications. To address this, we introduce HydraMix, a novel architecture that generates new image compositions by mixing multiple different images from the same class. HydraMix learns the fusion of the content of various images guided by a segmentation-based mixing mask in feature space and is optimized via a combination of unsupervised and adversarial training. Our data augmentation scheme allows the creation of models trained from scratch on very small datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on ciFAIR-10, STL-10, and ciFAIR-100. Additionally, we introduce a novel text-image metric to assess the generality of the augmented datasets. Our results show that HydraMix outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for image classification on small datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[reBEN: Refined BigEarthNet Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03653v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents refined BigEarthNet (reBEN) that is a large-scale, multi-modal remote sensing dataset constructed to support deep learning (DL) studies for remote sensing image analysis. The reBEN dataset consists of 549,488 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. To construct reBEN, we initially consider the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 tiles used to construct the BigEarthNet dataset and then divide them into patches of size 1200 m x 1200 m. We apply atmospheric correction to the Sentinel-2 patches using the latest version of the sen2cor tool, resulting in higher-quality patches compared to those present in BigEarthNet. Each patch is then associated with a pixel-level reference map and scene-level multi-labels. This makes reBEN suitable for pixel- and scene-based learning tasks. The labels are derived from the most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 by utilizing the 19-class nomenclature as in BigEarthNet. The use of the most recent CLC map results in overcoming the label noise present in BigEarthNet. Furthermore, we introduce a new geographical-based split assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the spatial correlation among the train, validation, and test sets with respect to those present in BigEarthNet. This increases the reliability of the evaluation of DL models. To minimize the DL model training time, we introduce software tools that convert the reBEN dataset into a DL-optimized data format. In our experiments, we show the potential of reBEN for multi-modal multi-label image classification problems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models. The pre-trained model weights, associated code, and complete dataset are available at https://bigearth.net.</p></details> |  | None |

Annotation and retrieval of the images pose classification problems, where each class is defined as the group of database images labelled with a common semantic label. Various systems have been proposed for content-based retrieval, as well as for image classification and indexing. In this paper, a hierarchical classification framework has been proposed for bridging the semantic gap effectively and achieving multi-category image classification. A well known pre-processing and post-processing method was used and applied to three problems; image segmentation, object identification and image classification. The method was applied to classify single object images from Amazon and Google datasets. The classification was tested for four different classifiers; BayesNetwork (BN), Random Forest (RF), Bagging and Vote. The estimated classification accuracies ranged from 20% to 99% (using 10-fold cross validation). The Bagging classifier presents the best performance, followed by the Random Forest classifier.</p></details> |  | None |

Invariant and equivariant neural networks are powerful and well-established models for enforcing inductive biases. In this paper, we demonstrate that the inductive bias imposed on the by an equivariant model must also be taken into account when using latent representations. We show how not accounting for the inductive biases leads to decreased performance on downstream tasks, and vice versa, how accounting for inductive biases can be done effectively by using an invariant projection of the latent representations. We propose principles for how to choose such a projection, and show the impact of using these principles in two common examples: First, we study a permutation equivariant variational auto-encoder trained for molecule graph generation; here we show that invariant projections can be designed that incur no loss of information in the resulting invariant representation. Next, we study a rotation-equivariant representation used for image classification. Here, we illustrate how random invariant projections can be used to obtain an invariant representation with a high degree of retained information. In both cases, the analysis of invariant latent representations proves superior to their equivariant counterparts. Finally, we illustrate that the phenomena documented here for equivariant neural networks have counterparts in standard neural networks where invariance is encouraged via augmentation. Thus, while these ambiguities may be known by experienced developers of equivariant models, we make both the knowledge as well as effective tools to handle the ambiguities available to the broader community.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was updated to reflect the version accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> | None |

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output features quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating its superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex classification medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Noise-Tolerant Network for Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07163v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike image classification and annotation, for which deep network models have achieved dominating superior performances compared to traditional computer vision algorithms, deep learning for automatic image segmentation still faces critical challenges. One of such hurdles is to obtain ground-truth segmentations as the training labels for deep network training. Especially when we study biomedical images, such as histopathological images (histo-images), it is unrealistic to ask for manual segmentation labels as the ground truth for training due to the fine image resolution as well as the large image size and complexity. In this paper, instead of relying on clean segmentation labels, we study whether and how integrating imperfect or noisy segmentation results from off-the-shelf segmentation algorithms may help achieve better segmentation results through a new Adaptive Noise-Tolerant Network (ANTN) model. We extend the noisy label deep learning to image segmentation with two novel aspects: (1) multiple noisy labels can be integrated into one deep learning model; (2) noisy segmentation modeling, including probabilistic parameters, is adaptive, depending on the given testing image appearance. Implementation of the new ANTN model on both the synthetic data and real-world histo-images demonstrates its effectiveness and superiority over off-the-shelf and other existing deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spurious Feature Eraser: Stabilizing Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00376v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models have exhibited remarkable success across a multitude of downstream tasks due to their scalability on extensive image-text paired data. However, these models also display significant limitations when applied to downstream tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, as a result of ``decision shortcuts'' that hinder their generalization capabilities. In this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features, encompassing both \textit{desired invariant causal features} and \textit{undesired decision shortcuts}. Moreover, the underperformance of CLIP on downstream tasks originates from its inability to effectively utilize pre-trained features in accordance with specific task requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective method, Spurious Feature Eraser (SEraser), to alleviate the decision shortcuts by erasing the spurious features. Specifically, we introduce a test-time prompt tuning paradigm that optimizes a learnable prompt, thereby compelling the model to exploit invariant features while disregarding decision shortcuts during the inference phase. The proposed method effectively alleviates excessive dependence on potentially misleading spurious information. We conduct comparative analysis of the proposed method against various approaches which validates the significant superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their exponentially increasing size creates a proportionally greater demand for energy and computational hardware. Incorporating complex physical events in networks as fixed, efficient computation modules can address this demand by decreasing the complexity of trainable layers. Here, we utilize ultrashort pulse propagation in multimode fibers, which perform large-scale nonlinear transformations, for this purpose. Training the hybrid architecture is achieved through a neural model that differentiably approximates the optical system. The training algorithm updates the neural simulator and backpropagates the error signal over this proxy to optimize layers preceding the optical one. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art image classification accuracies and simulation fidelity. Moreover, the framework demonstrates exceptional resilience to experimental drifts. By integrating low-energy physical systems into neural networks, this approach enables scalable, energy-efficient AI models with significantly reduced computational demands.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures | None |

With the continuous evolution of deep learning technology, many image classification models are committed to improving recognition accuracy, but this is often accompanied by problems such as large model resource usage, complex structure, and high power consumption, which makes it challenging to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. Herein, we propose an ultra-lightweight binary neural network (BNN) model designed for hardware deployment, and conduct image classification research based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. In addition, we also verify it on the Chinese Traffic Sign (CTS) and Belgian Traffic Sign (BTS) datasets. The proposed model shows excellent recognition performance with an accuracy of up to 97.64%, making it one of the best performing BNN models in the GTSRB dataset. Compared with the full-precision model, the accuracy loss is controlled within 1%, and the parameter storage overhead of the model is only 10% of that of the full-precision model. More importantly, our network model only relies on logical operations and low-bit width fixed-point addition and subtraction operations during the inference phase, which greatly simplifies the design complexity of the processing element (PE). Our research shows the great potential of BNN in the hardware deployment of computer vision models, especially in the field of computer vision tasks related to autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Balance Divergence for Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07804v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation has been widely adopted in computer vision task processing, since it can effectively enhance the performance of lightweight student networks by leveraging the knowledge transferred from cumbersome teacher networks. Most existing knowledge distillation methods utilize Kullback-Leibler divergence to mimic the logit output probabilities between the teacher network and the student network. Nonetheless, these methods may neglect the negative parts of the teacher's ''dark knowledge'' because the divergence calculations may ignore the effect of the minute probabilities from the teacher's logit output. This deficiency may lead to suboptimal performance in logit mimicry during the distillation process and result in an imbalance of information acquired by the student network. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this imbalance and propose a novel method, named Balance Divergence Distillation. By introducing a compensatory operation using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, our method can improve the modeling of the extremely small values in the negative from the teacher and preserve the learning capacity for the positive. Furthermore, we test the impact of different temperature coefficients adjustments, which may conducted to further balance for knowledge transferring. We evaluate the proposed method on several computer vision tasks, including image classification and semantic segmentation. The evaluation results show that our method achieves an accuracy improvement of 1%~3% for lightweight students on both CIFAR-100 and ImageNet dataset, and a 4.55% improvement in mIoU for PSP-ResNet18 on the Cityscapes dataset. The experiments show that our method is a simple yet highly effective solution that can be smoothly applied to different knowledge distillation methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks for Visual Perception and Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07783v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image pyramids are widely adopted in top-performing methods to obtain multi-scale features for precise visual perception and understanding. However, current image pyramids use the same large-scale model to process multiple resolutions of images, leading to significant computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture, called Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP). Specifically, PIIP uses pretrained models (ViTs or CNNs) as branches to process multi-scale images, where images of higher resolutions are processed by smaller network branches to balance computational cost and performance. To integrate information from different spatial scales, we further propose a novel cross-branch feature interaction mechanism. To validate PIIP, we apply it to various perception models and a representative multimodal large language model called LLaVA, and conduct extensive experiments on various tasks such as object detection, segmentation, image classification and multimodal understanding. PIIP achieves superior performance compared to single-branch and existing multi-resolution approaches with lower computational cost. When applied to InternViT-6B, a large-scale vision foundation model, PIIP can improve its performance by 1%-2% on detection and segmentation with only 40%-60% of the original computation, finally achieving 60.0 box AP on MS COCO and 59.7 mIoU on ADE20K. For multimodal understanding, our PIIP-LLaVA achieves 73.0% accuracy on TextVQA and 74.5% on MMBench with only 2.8M training data. Our code is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PIIP.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PIIP) |
| **[Sparse Attention Vectors: Generative Multimodal Model Features Are Discriminative Vision-Language Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00142v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like LLaVA and Qwen-VL excel at a wide variety of vision-language (VL) tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering. Despite strong performance, LMMs are not directly suited for foundational discriminative vision-language tasks (i.e., tasks requiring discrete label predictions) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for discriminative tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative models. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach for finding features in the model's latent space to more effectively leverage LMMs for discriminative tasks. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 1\% of the heads) in LMMs as strong features for VL tasks. With only few-shot examples, SAVs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to a variety of few-shot and finetuned baselines on a collection of discriminative tasks. Our experiments also imply that SAVs can scale in performance with additional examples and generalize to similar tasks, establishing SAVs as both effective and robust multimodal feature representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Remove that Square Root: A New Efficient Scale-Invariant Version of AdaGrad](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02648v4)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive methods are extremely popular in machine learning as they make learning rate tuning less expensive. This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm named KATE, which presents a scale-invariant adaptation of the well-known AdaGrad algorithm. We prove the scale-invariance of KATE for the case of Generalized Linear Models. Moreover, for general smooth non-convex problems, we establish a convergence rate of $O \left(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}} \right)$ for KATE, matching the best-known ones for AdaGrad and Adam. We also compare KATE to other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms Adam and AdaGrad in numerical experiments with different problems, including complex machine learning tasks like image classification and text classification on real data. The results indicate that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and matches/surpasses the performance of Adam in all considered scenarios.</p></details> | 32 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Class Distance Weighted Cross Entropy Loss for Classification of Disease Severity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01246v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing disease severity with ordinal classes, where each class reflects increasing severity levels, benefits from loss functions designed for this ordinal structure. Traditional categorical loss functions, like Cross-Entropy (CE), often perform suboptimally in these scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel loss function, Class Distance Weighted Cross-Entropy (CDW-CE), which penalizes misclassifications more severely when the predicted and actual classes are farther apart. We evaluated CDW-CE using various deep architectures, comparing its performance against several categorical and ordinal loss functions. To assess the quality of latent representations, we used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualizations, quantified the clustering quality using the Silhouette Score, and compared Class Activation Maps (CAM) generated by models trained with CDW-CE and CE loss. Feedback from domain experts was incorporated to evaluate how well model attention aligns with expert opinion. Our results show that CDW-CE consistently improves performance in ordinal image classification tasks. It achieves higher Silhouette Scores, indicating better class discrimination capability, and its CAM visualizations show a stronger focus on clinically significant regions, as validated by domain experts. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) scores highlight that CDW-CE outperforms other loss functions, including prominent ordinal loss functions from the literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uncertainty Guarantees on Automated Precision Weeding using Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07185v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision agriculture in general, and precision weeding in particular, have greatly benefited from the major advancements in deep learning and computer vision. A large variety of commercial robotic solutions are already available and deployed. However, the adoption by farmers of such solutions is still low for many reasons, an important one being the lack of trust in these systems. This is in great part due to the opaqueness and complexity of deep neural networks and the manufacturers' inability to provide valid guarantees on their performance. Conformal prediction, a well-established methodology in the machine learning community, is an efficient and reliable strategy for providing trustworthy guarantees on the predictions of any black-box model under very minimal constraints. Bridging the gap between the safe machine learning and precision agriculture communities, this article showcases conformal prediction in action on the task of precision weeding through deep learning-based image classification. After a detailed presentation of the conformal prediction methodology and the development of a precision spraying pipeline based on a ''conformalized'' neural network and well-defined spraying decision rules, the article evaluates this pipeline on two real-world scenarios: one under in-distribution conditions, the other reflecting a near out-of-distribution setting. The results show that we are able to provide formal, i.e. certifiable, guarantees on spraying at least 90% of the weeds.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast and reliable uncertainty quantification with neural network ensembles for industrial image classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10182v5)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification with neural networks (NNs) is widely used in industrial processes, situations where the model likely encounters unknown objects during deployment, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Worryingly, NNs tend to make confident yet incorrect predictions when confronted with OOD data. To increase the models' reliability, they should quantify the uncertainty in their own predictions, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Deep ensembles, composed of multiple independent NNs, have been shown to perform strongly but are computationally expensive. Recent research has proposed more efficient NN ensembles, namely the snapshot, batch, and multi-input multi-output ensemble. This study investigates the predictive and uncertainty performance of efficient NN ensembles in the context of image classification for industrial processes. It is the first to provide a comprehensive comparison and it proposes a novel Diversity Quality metric to quantify the ensembles' performance on the in-distribution and OOD sets in one single metric. The results highlight the batch ensemble as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to the deep ensemble. It matches the deep ensemble in both uncertainty and accuracy while exhibiting considerable savings in training time, test time, and memory storage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Manuscript version of an article published in Annals of Operations Research</p></details> | None |
