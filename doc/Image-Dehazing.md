| **[Unpaired Image Dehazing via Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformation of Latent Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07812v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an innovative framework for Unsupervised Image Dehazing via Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformation, termed UID-KAT. Image dehazing is recognized as a challenging and ill-posed vision task that requires complex transformations and interpretations in the feature space. Recent advancements have introduced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) since KANs can leverage their polynomial foundation to more efficiently approximate complex functions while requiring fewer layers than MLPs. Motivated by this potential, this paper explores the use of KANs combined with adversarial training and contrastive learning to model the intricate relationship between hazy and clear images. Adversarial training is employed due to its capacity in producing high-fidelity images, and contrastive learning promotes the model's emphasis on significant features while suppressing the influence of irrelevant information. The proposed UID-KAT framework is trained in an unsupervised setting to take advantage of the abundance of real-world data and address the challenge of preparing paired hazy/clean images. Experimental results show that UID-KAT achieves state-of-the-art dehazing performance across multiple datasets and scenarios, outperforming existing unpaired methods while reducing model complexity.

| **[CLIP-DQA: Blindly Evaluating Dehazed Images from Global and Local Perspectives Using CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01707v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind dehazed image quality assessment (BDQA), which aims to accurately predict the visual quality of dehazed images without any reference information, is essential for the evaluation, comparison, and optimization of image dehazing algorithms. Existing learning-based BDQA methods have achieved remarkable success, while the small scale of DQA datasets limits their performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to adapt Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP), pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, to the BDQA task. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the human visual system understands images based on hierarchical features, we take global and local information of the dehazed image as the input of CLIP. To accurately map the input hierarchical information of dehazed images into the quality score, we tune both the vision branch and language branch of CLIP with prompt learning. Experimental results on two authentic DQA datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach, named CLIP-DQA, achieves more accurate quality predictions over existing BDQA methods.

| **[WaveDH: Wavelet Sub-bands Guided ConvNet for Efficient Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01604v3)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in interest regarding image dehazing has led to notable advancements in deep learning-based single image dehazing approaches, exhibiting impressive performance in recent studies. Despite these strides, many existing methods fall short in meeting the efficiency demands of practical applications. In this paper, we introduce WaveDH, a novel and compact ConvNet designed to address this efficiency gap in image dehazing. Our WaveDH leverages wavelet sub-bands for guided up-and-downsampling and frequency-aware feature refinement. The key idea lies in utilizing wavelet decomposition to extract low-and-high frequency components from feature levels, allowing for faster processing while upholding high-quality reconstruction. The downsampling block employs a novel squeeze-and-attention scheme to optimize the feature downsampling process in a structurally compact manner through wavelet domain learning, preserving discriminative features while discarding noise components. In our upsampling block, we introduce a dual-upsample and fusion mechanism to enhance high-frequency component awareness, aiding in the reconstruction of high-frequency details. Departing from conventional dehazing methods that treat low-and-high frequency components equally, our feature refinement block strategically processes features with a frequency-aware approach. By employing a coarse-to-fine methodology, it not only refines the details at frequency levels but also significantly optimizes computational costs. The refinement is performed in a maximum 8x downsampled feature space, striking a favorable efficiency-vs-accuracy trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, WaveDH, outperforms many state-of-the-art methods on several image dehazing benchmarks with significantly reduced computational costs.

| **[UR2P-Dehaze: Learning a Simple Image Dehaze Enhancer via Unpaired Rich Physical Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06818v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing techniques aim to enhance contrast and restore details, which are essential for preserving visual information and improving image processing accuracy. Existing methods rely on a single manual prior, which cannot effectively reveal image details. To overcome this limitation, we propose an unpaired image dehazing network, called the Simple Image Dehaze Enhancer via Unpaired Rich Physical Prior (UR2P-Dehaze). First, to accurately estimate the illumination, reflectance, and color information of the hazy image, we design a shared prior estimator (SPE) that is iteratively trained to ensure the consistency of illumination and reflectance, generating clear, high-quality images. Additionally, a self-monitoring mechanism is introduced to eliminate undesirable features, providing reliable priors for image reconstruction. Next, we propose Dynamic Wavelet Separable Convolution (DWSC), which effectively integrates key features across both low and high frequencies, significantly enhancing the preservation of image details and ensuring global consistency. Finally, to effectively restore the color information of the image, we propose an Adaptive Color Corrector that addresses the problem of unclear colors. The PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID and CIEDE2000 metrics on the benchmark dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. It also contributes to the performance improvement of downstream tasks. The project code will be available at https://github.com/Fan-pixel/UR2P-Dehaze. \end{abstract}</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Fan-pixel/UR2P-Dehaze) |
| **[HazeCLIP: Towards Language Guided Real-World Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13719v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods have achieved remarkable performance in image dehazing, particularly on synthetic datasets. However, they often struggle with real-world hazy images due to domain shift, limiting their practical applicability. This paper introduces HazeCLIP, a language-guided adaptation framework designed to enhance the real-world performance of pre-trained dehazing networks. Inspired by the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model's ability to distinguish between hazy and clean images, we leverage it to evaluate dehazing results. Combined with a region-specific dehazing technique and tailored prompt sets, the CLIP model accurately identifies hazy areas, providing a high-quality, human-like prior that guides the fine-tuning process of pre-trained networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HazeCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-word image dehazing, evaluated through both visual quality and image quality assessment metrics.

| **[MB-TaylorFormer V2: Improved Multi-branch Linear Transformer Expanded by Taylor Formula for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04486v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Transformer networks have demonstrated outstanding performance in the field of image restoration due to the global receptive field and adaptability to input. However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

| **[Transformer-Driven Inverse Problem Transform for Fast Blind Hyperspectral Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01924v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral dehazing (HyDHZ) has become a crucial signal processing technology to facilitate the subsequent identification and classification tasks, as the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) data portal reports a massive portion of haze-corrupted areas in typical hyperspectral remote sensing images. The idea of inverse problem transform (IPT) has been proposed in recent remote sensing literature in order to reformulate a hardly tractable inverse problem (e.g., HyDHZ) into a relatively simple one. Considering the emerging spectral super-resolution (SSR) technique, which spectrally upsamples multispectral data to hyperspectral data, we aim to solve the challenging HyDHZ problem by reformulating it as an SSR problem. Roughly speaking, the proposed algorithm first automatically selects some uncorrupted/informative spectral bands, from which SSR is applied to spectrally upsample the selected bands in the feature space, thereby obtaining a clean hyperspectral image (HSI). The clean HSI is then further refined by a deep transformer network to obtain the final dehazed HSI, where a global attention mechanism is designed to capture nonlocal information. There are very few HyDHZ works in existing literature, and this article introduces the powerful spatial-spectral transformer into HyDHZ for the first time. Remarkably, the proposed transformer-driven IPT-based HyDHZ (T2HyDHZ) is a blind algorithm without requiring the user to manually select the corrupted region. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of T2HyDHZ with less color distortion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS)</p></details> | None |
| **[Guided Real Image Dehazing using YCbCr Color Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17496v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing, particularly with learning-based methods, has gained significant attention due to its importance in real-world applications. However, relying solely on the RGB color space often fall short, frequently leaving residual haze. This arises from two main issues: the difficulty in obtaining clear textural features from hazy RGB images and the complexity of acquiring real haze/clean image pairs outside controlled environments like smoke-filled scenes. To address these issues, we first propose a novel Structure Guided Dehazing Network (SGDN) that leverages the superior structural properties of YCbCr features over RGB. It comprises two key modules: Bi-Color Guidance Bridge (BGB) and Color Enhancement Module (CEM). BGB integrates a phase integration module and an interactive attention module, utilizing the rich texture features of the YCbCr space to guide the RGB space, thereby recovering clearer features in both frequency and spatial domains. To maintain tonal consistency, CEM further enhances the color perception of RGB features by aggregating YCbCr channel information. Furthermore, for effective supervised learning, we introduce a Real-World Well-Aligned Haze (RW$^2$AH) dataset, which includes a diverse range of scenes from various geographical regions and climate conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple real-world smoke/haze datasets.

| **[NightHaze: Nighttime Image Dehazing via Self-Prior Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07408v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked autoencoder (MAE) shows that severe augmentation during training produces robust representations for high-level tasks. This paper brings the MAE-like framework to nighttime image enhancement, demonstrating that severe augmentation during training produces strong network priors that are resilient to real-world night haze degradations. We propose a novel nighttime image dehazing method with self-prior learning. Our main novelty lies in the design of severe augmentation, which allows our model to learn robust priors. Unlike MAE that uses masking, we leverage two key challenging factors of nighttime images as augmentation: light effects and noise. During training, we intentionally degrade clear images by blending them with light effects as well as by adding noise, and subsequently restore the clear images. This enables our model to learn clear background priors. By increasing the noise values to approach as high as the pixel intensity values of the glow and light effect blended images, our augmentation becomes severe, resulting in stronger priors. While our self-prior learning is considerably effective in suppressing glow and revealing details of background scenes, in some cases, there are still some undesired artifacts that remain, particularly in the forms of over-suppression. To address these artifacts, we propose a self-refinement module based on the semi-supervised teacher-student framework. Our NightHaze, especially our MAE-like self-prior learning, shows that models trained with severe augmentation effectively improve the visibility of input haze images, approaching the clarity of clear nighttime images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our NightHaze achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing nighttime image dehazing methods by a substantial margin of 15.5% for MUSIQ and 23.5% for ClipIQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

| **[Real-world Image Dehazing with Coherence-based Pseudo Labeling and Cooperative Unfolding Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07966v5)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world Image Dehazing (RID) aims to alleviate haze-induced degradation in real-world settings. This task remains challenging due to the complexities in accurately modeling real haze distributions and the scarcity of paired real-world data. To address these challenges, we first introduce a cooperative unfolding network that jointly models atmospheric scattering and image scenes, effectively integrating physical knowledge into deep networks to restore haze-contaminated details. Additionally, we propose the first RID-oriented iterative mean-teacher framework, termed the Coherence-based Label Generator, to generate high-quality pseudo labels for network training. Specifically, we provide an optimal label pool to store the best pseudo-labels during network training, leveraging both global and local coherence to select high-quality candidates and assign weights to prioritize haze-free regions. We verify the effectiveness of our method, with experiments demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on RID tasks.

| **[Distilled Pooling Transformer Encoder for Efficient Realistic Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14220v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a lightweight neural network designed for realistic image dehazing, utilizing a Distilled Pooling Transformer Encoder, named DPTE-Net. Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net. Additionally, DPTE-Net is trained within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, leveraging the strong generalization of GAN in image restoration, and employs a transmission-aware loss function to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DPTE-Net can achieve competitive dehazing performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a promising solution for resource-limited applications.

| **[Towards Context-aware Convolutional Network for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11008v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing task to recover a high-quality image from its corrupted observation. Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Variational Bayesian Modeling of Haze Degradation Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03745v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relying on the representation power of neural networks, most recent works have often neglected several factors involved in haze degradation, such as transmission (the amount of light reaching an observer from a scene over distance) and atmospheric light. These factors are generally unknown, making dehazing problems ill-posed and creating inherent uncertainties. To account for such uncertainties and factors involved in haze degradation, we introduce a variational Bayesian framework for single image dehazing. We propose to take not only a clean image and but also transmission map as latent variables, the posterior distributions of which are parameterized by corresponding neural networks: dehazing and transmission networks, respectively. Based on a physical model for haze degradation, our variational Bayesian framework leads to a new objective function that encourages the cooperation between them, facilitating the joint training of and thereby boosting the performance of each other. In our framework, a dehazing network can estimate a clean image independently of a transmission map estimation during inference, introducing no overhead. Furthermore, our model-agnostic framework can be seamlessly incorporated with other existing dehazing networks, greatly enhancing the performance consistently across datasets and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CIKM 2023, 10 pages, 9 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-Guided Posterior Sampling for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15295v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Polarization Image Dehazing Method Based on the Principle of Physical Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09924v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision is increasingly used in areas such as unmanned vehicles, surveillance systems and remote sensing. However, in foggy scenarios, image degradation leads to loss of target details, which seriously affects the accuracy and effectiveness of these vision tasks. Polarized light, due to the fact that its electromagnetic waves vibrate in a specific direction, is able to resist scattering and refraction effects in complex media more effectively compared to unpolarized light. As a result, polarized light has a greater ability to maintain its polarization characteristics in complex transmission media and under long-distance imaging conditions. This property makes polarized imaging especially suitable for complex scenes such as outdoor and underwater, especially in foggy environments, where higher quality images can be obtained. Based on this advantage, we propose an innovative semi-physical polarization dehazing method that does not rely on an external light source. The method simulates the diffusion process of fog and designs a diffusion kernel that corresponds to the image blurriness caused by this diffusion. By employing spatiotemporal Fourier transforms and deconvolution operations, the method recovers the state of fog droplets prior to diffusion and the light inversion distribution of objects. This approach effectively achieves dehazing and detail enhancement of the scene.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RSHazeDiff: A Unified Fourier-aware Diffusion Model for Remote Sensing Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09083v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Haze severely degrades the visual quality of remote sensing images and hampers the performance of road extraction, vehicle detection, and traffic flow monitoring. The emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) exhibits the significant potential for dense haze removal with its strong generation ability. Since remote sensing images contain extensive small-scale texture structures, it is important to effectively restore image details from hazy images. However, current wisdom of DDPM fails to preserve image details and color fidelity well, limiting its dehazing capacity for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Fourier-aware diffusion model for remote sensing image dehazing, termed RSHazeDiff. From a new perspective, RSHazeDiff explores the conditional DDPM to improve image quality in dense hazy scenarios, and it makes three key contributions. First, RSHazeDiff refines the training phase of diffusion process by performing noise estimation and reconstruction constraints in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Thus, it remedies the unpleasing results caused by the simple noise estimation constraint in DDPM. Second, by taking the frequency information as important prior knowledge during iterative sampling steps, RSHazeDiff can preserve more texture details and color fidelity in dehazed images. Third, we design a global compensated learning module to utilize the Fourier transform to capture the global dependency features of input images, which can effectively mitigate the effects of boundary artifacts when processing fixed-size patches. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the favorable performance of RSHazeDiff over state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Dropout the High-rate Downsampling: A Novel Design Paradigm for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06456v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the popularization of high-end mobile devices, Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images have become ubiquitous in our lives. The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on three UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring, show that our model achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | WACV2025 | None |

However, most of them need very complicated training procedures to achieve satisfactory results. For the first time, we present a novel pipeline called Prompt-based Test-Time Dehazing (PTTD) to help generate visually pleasing results of real-captured hazy images during the inference phase. We experimentally observe that given a dehazing model trained on synthetic data, fine-tuning the statistics (\ie, mean and standard deviation) of encoding features is able to narrow the domain gap, boosting the performance of real image dehazing. Accordingly, we first apply a prompt generation module (PGM) to generate a visual prompt, which is the reference of appropriate statistical perturbations for mean and standard deviation. Then, we employ a feature adaptation module (FAM) into the existing dehazing models for adjusting the original statistics with the guidance of the generated prompt. PTTD is model-agnostic and can be equipped with various state-of-the-art dehazing models trained on synthetic hazy-clean pairs to tackle the real image dehazing task. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our PTTD is effective, achieving superior performance against state-of-the-art dehazing methods in real-world scenarios.

However, in low-visibility environments such as hazy conditions, the performance of traditional object detection algorithms often degrades significantly, failing to meet the demands of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, this paper proposes two innovative deep learning models: YOLO-Vehicle and YOLO-Vehicle-Pro. YOLO-Vehicle is an object detection model tailored specifically for autonomous driving scenarios, employing multimodal fusion techniques to combine image and textual information for object detection. YOLO-Vehicle-Pro builds upon this foundation by introducing an improved image dehazing algorithm, enhancing detection performance in low-visibility environments. In addition to model innovation, this paper also designs and implements a cloud-edge collaborative object detection system, deploying models on edge devices and offloading partial computational tasks to the cloud in complex situations. Experimental results demonstrate that on the KITTI dataset, the YOLO-Vehicle-v1s model achieved 92.1% accuracy while maintaining a detection speed of 226 FPS and an inference time of 12ms, meeting the real-time requirements of autonomous driving. When processing hazy images, the YOLO-Vehicle-Pro model achieved a high accuracy of 82.3% mAP@50 on the Foggy Cityscapes dataset while maintaining a detection speed of 43 FPS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LMHaze: Intensity-aware Image Dehazing with a Large-scale Multi-intensity Real Haze Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16095v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing has drawn a significant attention in recent years. Learning-based methods usually require paired hazy and corresponding ground truth (haze-free) images for training. However, it is difficult to collect real-world image pairs, which prevents developments of existing methods. Although several works partially alleviate this issue by using synthetic datasets or small-scale real datasets. The haze intensity distribution bias and scene homogeneity in existing datasets limit the generalization ability of these methods, particularly when encountering images with previously unseen haze intensities. In this work, we present LMHaze, a large-scale, high-quality real-world dataset. LMHaze comprises paired hazy and haze-free images captured in diverse indoor and outdoor environments, spanning multiple scenarios and haze intensities. It contains over 5K high-resolution image pairs, surpassing the size of the biggest existing real-world dehazing dataset by over 25 times. Meanwhile, to better handle images with different haze intensities, we propose a mixture-of-experts model based on Mamba (MoE-Mamba) for dehazing, which dynamically adjusts the model parameters according to the haze intensity. Moreover, with our proposed dataset, we conduct a new large multimodal model (LMM)-based benchmark study to simulate human perception for evaluating dehazed images. Experiments demonstrate that LMHaze dataset improves the dehazing performance in real scenarios and our dehazing method provides better results compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Additionally, their performance is often inadequate under non-uniform or heavy haze. To address these challenges, we developed the Detail Recovery And Contrastive DehazeNet, which facilitates efficient and effective dehazing via a dense dilated inverted residual block and an attention-based detail recovery network that tailors enhancements to specific dehazed scene contexts. A major innovation is its ability to train effectively with limited data, achieved through a novel quadruplet loss-based contrastive dehazing paradigm. This approach distinctly separates hazy and clear image features while also distinguish lower-quality and higher-quality dehazed images obtained from each sub-modules of our network, thereby refining the dehazing process to a larger extent. Extensive tests on a variety of benchmarked haze datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance in local and global feature extraction, respectively, and currently represent the two mainstream frameworks in image dehazing. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-branch image dehazing framework that guides CNN and Transformer components interactively. We reconsider the complementary characteristics of CNNs and Transformers by leveraging the differential relationships between global and local features for interactive guidance. This approach enables the capture of local feature positions through global attention maps, allowing the CNN to focus solely on feature information at effective positions.

Single image dehazing is essential for applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, with the aim of restoring image clarity. In this work, we propose WTCL-Dehaze an enhanced semi-supervised dehazing network that integrates Contrastive Loss and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). We incorporate contrastive regularization to enhance feature representation by contrasting hazy and clear image pairs. Additionally, we utilize DWT for multi-scale feature extraction, effectively capturing high-frequency details and global structures. Our approach leverages both labelled and unlabelled data to mitigate the domain gap and improve generalization. The model is trained on a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios.

The lack of real-life hazy ground truth images necessitates synthetic datasets, which often lack diverse haze types, impeding effective haze type classification and dehazing algorithm selection. This research introduces the HazeSpace2M dataset, a collection of over 2 million images designed to enhance dehazing through haze type classification. HazeSpace2M includes diverse scenes with 10 haze intensity levels, featuring Fog, Cloud, and Environmental Haze (EH). Using the dataset, we introduce a technique of haze type classification followed by specialized dehazers to clear hazy images. Unlike conventional methods, our approach classifies haze types before applying type-specific dehazing, improving clarity in real-life hazy images. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, ResNet50 and AlexNet achieve 92.75\% and 92.50\% accuracy, respectively, against existing synthetic datasets. However, these models achieve only 80% and 70% accuracy, respectively, against our Real Hazy Testset (RHT), highlighting the challenging nature of our HazeSpace2M dataset. Additional experiments show that haze type classification followed by specialized dehazing improves results by 2.41% in PSNR, 17.14% in SSIM, and 10.2\% in MSE over general dehazers. Moreover, when testing with SOTA dehazing models, we found that applying our proposed framework significantly improves their performance. These results underscore the significance of HazeSpace2M and our proposed framework in addressing atmospheric haze in multimedia processing.

While deep learning has made significant strides in this area, more and more methods are constrained by network depth. Consequently, lots of approaches have adopted parallel branching strategies. however, they often prioritize aspects such as resolution, receptive field, or frequency domain segmentation without dynamically partitioning branches based on the distribution of input features. Inspired by dynamic filtering, we propose using cascaded dynamic filters to create a multi-branch network by dynamically generating filter kernels based on feature map distribution. To better handle branch features, we propose a residual multiscale block (RMB), combining different receptive fields. Furthermore, we also introduce a dynamic convolution-based local fusion method to merge features from adjacent branches. Experiments on RESIDE, Haze4K, and O-Haze datasets validate our method's effectiveness, with our model achieving a PSNR of 43.21dB on the RESIDE-Indoor dataset.

PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components and defects in the aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the visible quality of aerial images is inevitably degraded by adverse weather like haze, rain, or snow, which are found to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to release numerous corresponding datasets, namely, HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for power line aerial image dehazing, RainCPLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for power line aerial image deraining, SnowCPLID, SnowInsPLAD for power line aerial image desnowing, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models. Meanwhile, we select numerous state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the baseline methods for PLAIR-AW. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasets.

In this paper, we introduce CLIPHaze, a pioneering hybrid framework that synergizes the efficient global modeling of Mamba with the prior knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of CLIP to address both issues simultaneously. Specifically, our method employs parallel state space model and window-based self-attention to obtain global contextual dependency and local fine-grained perception, respectively. To seamlessly aggregate information from both paths, we introduce CLIP-instructed Aggregation Module (CAM). For non-homogeneous and homogeneous haze, CAM leverages zero-shot estimated haze density map and high-quality image embedding without degradation information to explicitly and implicitly determine the optimal neural operation range for each pixel, thereby adaptively fusing two paths with different receptive fields. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that CLIPHaze achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in non-homogeneous haze.

| **[Single Image Dehazing Using Scene Depth Ordering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05683v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images captured in hazy weather generally suffer from quality degradation, and many dehazing methods have been developed to solve this problem. However, single image dehazing problem is still challenging due to its ill-posed nature. In this paper, we propose a depth order guided single image dehazing method, which utilizes depth order in hazy images to guide the dehazing process to achieve a similar depth perception in corresponding dehazing results. The consistency of depth perception ensures that the regions that look farther or closer in hazy images also appear farther or closer in the corresponding dehazing results, and thus effectively avoid the undesired visual effects. To achieve this goal, a simple yet effective strategy is proposed to extract the depth order in hazy images, which offers a reference for depth perception in hazy weather. Additionally, a depth order embedded transformation model is devised, which performs transmission estimation under the guidance of depth order to realize an unchanged depth order in the dehazing results. The extracted depth order provides a powerful global constraint for the dehazing process, which contributes to the efficient utilization of global information, thereby bringing an overall improvement in restoration quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can better recover potential structure and vivid color with higher computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art dehazing methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Dual High-Order Total Variation Model for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14868v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing, low-light image enhancement, and some high-level vision tasks.

Previously, many methods based on priors and deep learning have been proposed to address the task of image dehazing. Ignoring the domain gap between different data, former de-hazing methods usually adopt multiple datasets for explicit training, which often makes the methods themselves be violated. To address this problem, we propose a novel method of internal and external data augmentation to improve the existing dehazing methodology. By using cross-data external augmentor. The dataset inherits samples from different domains that are firmly aligned, making the model learn more robust and generalizable features. By using the internal data augmentation method, the model can fully exploit local information within the images, thereby obtaining more image details. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct training on both the Natural Image Dataset (NID) and the Remote Sensing Image Dataset (RSID). Experimental results show that our method clearly resolves the domain gap in different dehazing datasets and presents a new pipeline for joint training in the dehazing task. Our approach significantly outperforms other advanced methods in dehazing and produces dehazed images that are closest to real haze-free images.

Recognizing the limitations of traditional physical model-based methods and the inefficiencies of current attention-based solutions, we propose a new dehazing network combining an innovative Haze-Aware Attention Module (HAAM) with a Multiscale Frequency Enhancement Module (MFEM). The HAAM is inspired by the atmospheric scattering model, thus skillfully integrating physical principles into high-dimensional features for targeted dehazing. It picks up on latent features during the image restoration process, which gives a significant boost to the metrics, while the MFEM efficiently enhances high-frequency details, thus sidestepping wavelet or Fourier transform complexities. It employs multiscale fields to extract and emphasize key frequency components with minimal parameter overhead. Integrated into a simple U-Net framework, our Haze-Aware Attention Network (HAA-Net) for single-image dehazing significantly outperforms existing attention-based and transformer models in efficiency and effectiveness. Tested across various public datasets, the HAA-Net sets new performance benchmarks. Our work not only advances the field of image dehazing but also offers insights into the design of attention mechanisms for broader applications in computer vision.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures | None |

This paper proposes a novel dual-branch collaborative unpaired dehazing model (DCM-dehaze) to address this issue. The proposed method consists of two collaborative branches: dehazing and contour constraints. Specifically, we design a dual depthwise separable convolutional module (DDSCM) to enhance the information expressiveness of deeper features and the correlation to shallow features. In addition, we construct a bidirectional contour function to optimize the edge features of the image to enhance the clarity and fidelity of the image details. Furthermore, we present feature enhancers via a residual dense architecture to eliminate redundant features of the dehazing process and further alleviate the domain deviation problem.

Posterior sampling from the conditional score function enable the precious data consistency certified by the measurement-based likelihood term. However, most prevailing approaches confined to the deterministic deterioration process of the measurement model, regardless of capricious unpredictable disturbance in real-world sceneries. To address this obstacle, we show that the measurement-based likelihood can be renovated with restoration-based likelihood via the opposite probabilistic graphic direction, licencing the patronage of various off-the-shelf restoration models and extending the strictly deterministic deterioration process to adaptable clustered processes with the supposed prototype, in what we call restorer guidance. Particularly, assembled with versatile prototypes optionally, we can resolve inverse problems with bunch of choices for assorted sample quality and realize the proficient deterioration control with assured realistic. We show that our work can be formally analogous to the transition from classifier guidance to classifier-free guidance in the field of inverse problem solver.

| **[Depth Information Assisted Collaborative Mutual Promotion Network for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01105v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering a clear image from a single hazy image is an open inverse problem. Although significant research progress has been made, most existing methods ignore the effect that downstream tasks play in promoting upstream dehazing. From the perspective of the haze generation mechanism, there is a potential relationship between the depth information of the scene and the hazy image. Based on this, we propose a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework to achieve the dehazing of a single image. This framework integrates depth estimation and dehazing by a dual-task interaction mechanism and achieves mutual enhancement of their performance. To realize the joint optimization of the two tasks, an alternative implementation mechanism with the difference perception is developed. On the one hand, the difference perception between the depth maps of the dehazing result and the ideal image is proposed to promote the dehazing network to pay attention to the non-ideal areas of the dehazing. On the other hand, by improving the depth estimation performance in the difficult-to-recover areas of the hazy image, the dehazing network can explicitly use the depth information of the hazy image to assist the clear image recovery. To promote the depth estimation, we propose to use the difference between the dehazed image and the ground truth to guide the depth estimation network to focus on the dehazed unideal areas. It allows dehazing and depth estimation to leverage their strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that of the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | ACCEPT BY CVPR2024 | None |

While various methodologies have evolved from early works predicting transmission matrix and atmospheric light features to deep learning and dehazing networks, they innately prioritize dehazing quality metrics, neglecting the need for real-time applicability in time-sensitive domains like autonomous driving. This work introduces FALCON (Frequency Adjoint Link with CONtinuous density mask), a single-image dehazing system achieving state-of-the-art performance on both quality and speed. Particularly, we develop a novel bottleneck module, namely, Frequency Adjoint Link, operating in the frequency space to globally expand the receptive field with minimal growth in network size. Further, we leverage the underlying haze distribution based on the atmospheric scattering model via a Continuous Density Mask (CDM) which serves as a continuous-valued mask input prior and a differentiable auxiliary loss. Comprehensive experiments involving multiple state-of-the-art methods and ablation analysis demonstrate FALCON's exceptional performance in both dehazing quality and speed (i.e., >$180 frames-per-second), quantified by metrics such as FPS, PSNR, and SSIM.</p></details> |  | None |

UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

The emergence of CNNs and Transformers has taken extraordinary strides in the RSID arena. However, these methods often struggle to demonstrate the balance of adequate long-range dependency modeling and maintaining computational efficiency. To this end, we propose the first lightweight network on the mamba-based model called RSDhamba in the field of RSID. Greatly inspired by the recent rise of Selective State Space Model (SSM) for its superior performance in modeling linear complexity and remote dependencies, our designed RSDehamba integrates the SSM framework into the U-Net architecture. Specifically, we propose the Vision Dehamba Block (VDB) as the core component of the overall network, which utilizes the linear complexity of SSM to achieve the capability of global context encoding. Simultaneously, the Direction-aware Scan Module (DSM) is designed to dynamically aggregate feature exchanges over different directional domains to effectively enhance the flexibility of sensing the spatially varying distribution of haze. In this way, our RSDhamba fully demonstrates the superiority of spatial distance capture dependencies and channel information exchange for better extraction of haze features. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks validate the surpassing performance of our RSDehamba against existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional convolutional models struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive field size. While Transformers excel at capturing such dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity in relation to feature map resolution makes them less suitable for pixel-to-pixel dense prediction tasks. Moreover, fixed kernels or tokens in most models do not adapt well to varying blur sizes, resulting in suboptimal dehazing performance. In this study, we introduce a novel dehazing network based on Parallel Stripe Cross Attention (PCSA) with a multi-scale strategy.

To handle different sizes and shapes of blurs flexibly, We employs a channel-wise design with varying convolutional kernel sizes and strip lengths in each PCSA to capture context information at different scales.Additionally, we incorporate a softmax-based adaptive weighting mechanism within PCSA to prioritize and leverage more critical features.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages , 4 figures, CTISC'24</p></details> | None |
| **[ODCR: Orthogonal Decoupling Contrastive Regularization for Unpaired Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17825v1)** | 2024-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpaired image dehazing (UID) holds significant research importance due to the challenges in acquiring haze/clear image pairs with identical backgrounds. This paper proposes a novel method for UID named Orthogonal Decoupling Contrastive Regularization (ODCR). Our method is grounded in the assumption that an image consists of both haze-related features, which influence the degree of haze, and haze-unrelated features, such as texture and semantic information. ODCR aims to ensure that the haze-related features of the dehazing result closely resemble those of the clear image, while the haze-unrelated features align with the input hazy image. To accomplish the motivation, Orthogonal MLPs optimized geometrically on the Stiefel manifold are proposed, which can project image features into an orthogonal space, thereby reducing the relevance between different features. Furthermore, a task-driven Depth-wise Feature Classifier (DWFC) is proposed, which assigns weights to the orthogonal features based on the contribution of each channel's feature in predicting whether the feature source is hazy or clear in a self-supervised fashion. Finally, a Weighted PatchNCE (WPNCE) loss is introduced to achieve the pulling of haze-related features in the output image toward those of clear images, while bringing haze-unrelated features close to those of the hazy input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our ODCR method on UID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[PriorNet: A Novel Lightweight Network with Multidimensional Interactive Attention for Efficient Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15638v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hazy images degrade visual quality, and dehazing is a crucial prerequisite for subsequent processing tasks. Most current dehazing methods rely on neural networks and face challenges such as high computational parameter pressure and weak generalization capabilities. This paper introduces PriorNet--a novel, lightweight, and highly applicable dehazing network designed to significantly improve the clarity and visual quality of hazy images while avoiding excessive detail extraction issues. The core of PriorNet is the original Multi-Dimensional Interactive Attention (MIA) mechanism, which effectively captures a wide range of haze characteristics, substantially reducing the computational load and generalization difficulties associated with complex systems. By utilizing a uniform convolutional kernel size and incorporating skip connections, we have streamlined the feature extraction process. Simplifying the number of layers and architecture not only enhances dehazing efficiency but also facilitates easier deployment on edge devices. Extensive testing across multiple datasets has demonstrated PriorNet's exceptional performance in dehazing and clarity restoration, maintaining image detail and color fidelity in single-image dehazing tasks. Notably, with a model size of just 18Kb, PriorNet showcases superior dehazing generalization capabilities compared to other methods. Our research makes a significant contribution to advancing image dehazing technology, providing new perspectives and tools for the field and related domains, particularly emphasizing the importance of improving universality and deployability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

A huge domain gap between synthetic and real-world haze images degrades dehazing performance in practical settings. However, collecting real-world image datasets for training dehazing models is challenging since both hazy and clean pairs must be captured under the same conditions. In this paper, we propose a Physics-guided Parametric Augmentation Network (PANet) that generates photo-realistic hazy and clean training pairs to effectively enhance real-world dehazing performance. PANet comprises a Haze-to-Parameter Mapper (HPM) to project hazy images into a parameter space and a Parameter-to-Haze Mapper (PHM) to map the resampled haze parameters back to hazy images. In the parameter space, we can pixel-wisely resample individual haze parameter maps to generate diverse hazy images with physically-explainable haze conditions unseen in the training set. Our experimental results demonstrate that PANet can augment diverse realistic hazy images to enrich existing hazy image benchmarks so as to effectively boost the performances of state-of-the-art image dehazing models.</p></details> |  | None |

Though previous methods have made marvelous progress, they still suffer from information loss in content and color in dense-haze scenarios. The recently emerged Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) exhibits strong generation ability, showing potential for solving this problem. However, DDPM fails to consider the physics property of dehazing task, limiting its information completion capacity. In this work, we propose DehazeDDPM: A DDPM-based and physics-aware image dehazing framework that applies to complex hazy scenarios. Specifically, DehazeDDPM works in two stages. The former stage physically models the dehazing task with the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM), pulling the distribution closer to the clear data and endowing DehazeDDPM with fog-aware ability. The latter stage exploits the strong generation ability of DDPM to compensate for the haze-induced huge information loss, by working in conjunction with the physical modelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world hazy datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent research mainly focus on deep learning-based methods with single modality, while they may result in severe information loss especially in dense-haze scenarios. The infrared image exhibits robustness to the haze, however, existing methods have primarily treated the infrared modality as auxiliary information, failing to fully explore its rich information in dehazing. To address this challenge, the key insight of this study is to design a visible-infrared fusion network for image dehazing. In particular, we propose a multi-scale Deep Structure Feature Extraction (DSFE) module, which incorporates the Channel-Pixel Attention Block (CPAB) to restore more spatial and marginal information within the deep structural features. Additionally, we introduce an inconsistency weighted fusion strategy to merge the two modalities by leveraging the more reliable information. To validate this, we construct a visible-infrared multimodal dataset called AirSim-VID based on the AirSim simulation platform. Extensive experiments performed on challenging real and simulated image datasets demonstrate that VIFNet can outperform many state-of-the-art competing methods.

Previous deep learning-based image dehazing methods have failed to achieve satisfactory dehazing effects on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets, exhibiting poor generalization. Moreover, single-stage networks often result in many regions with artifacts and color distortion in output images. To address these issues, this paper proposes a two-stage image dehazing network called TSNet, mainly consisting of the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) and the adaptive learning module (ALM). Specifically, MSFM and ALM enhance the generalization of TSNet. The MSFM can obtain large receptive fields at multiple scales and integrate features at different frequencies to reduce the differences between inputs and learning objectives. The ALM can actively learn of regions of interest in images and restore texture details more effectively. Additionally, TSNet is designed as a two-stage network, where the first-stage network performs image dehazing, and the second-stage network is employed to improve issues such as artifacts and color distortion present in the results of the first-stage network. We also change the learning objective from ground truth images to opposite fog maps, which improves the learning efficiency of TSNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSNet exhibits superior dehazing performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

However, few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First, there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes, which may cause haze, glow and noise with localized, coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second, due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data, unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues, we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing. First, the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the first issue. Second, a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

It is motivated by an observation that the estimated depths of an image with haze residuals and its clear counterpart vary. Enforcing the depth consistency of dehazed images with clear ones, therefore, is essential for dehazing. For this purpose, we develop a prompt based on the features of depth differences between the hazy input images and corresponding clear counterparts that can guide dehazing models for better restoration. Specifically, we first apply deep features extracted from the input images to the depth difference features for generating the prompt that contains the haze residual information in the input. Then we propose a prompt embedding module that is designed to perceive the haze residuals, by linearly adding the prompt to the deep features. Further, we develop an effective prompt attention module to pay more attention to haze residuals for better removal. By incorporating the prompt, prompt embedding, and prompt attention into an encoder-decoder network based on VQGAN, we can achieve better perception quality. As the depths of clear images are not available at inference, and the dehazed images with one-time feed-forward execution may still contain a portion of haze residuals, we propose a new continuous self-prompt inference that can iteratively correct the dehazing model towards better haze-free image generation. Extensive experiments show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets in terms of perception metrics including NIQE, PI, and PIQE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI24.

In this paper, we raise an intriguing question: can the combination of image restoration and object detection enhance detection performance in adverse weather conditions? To answer it, we propose an effective architecture that bridges image dehazing and object detection together via guidance information and task-driven learning to achieve detection-friendly dehazing, termed FriendNet. FriendNet aims to deliver both high-quality perception and high detection capacity. Different from existing efforts that intuitively treat image dehazing as pre-processing, FriendNet establishes a positive correlation between these two tasks. Clean features generated by the dehazing network potentially contribute to improvements in object detection performance. Conversely, object detection crucially guides the learning process of the image dehazing network under the task-driven learning scheme. We shed light on how downstream tasks can guide upstream dehazing processes, considering both network architecture and learning objectives. We design Guidance Fusion Block (GFB) and Guidance Attention Block (GAB) to facilitate the integration of detection information into the network. Furthermore, the incorporation of the detection task loss aids in refining the optimization process. Additionally, we introduce a new Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block (PFEB), which integrates physics-based priors to enhance the feature extraction and representation capabilities.

However, since the on-chip micro-polarizers block part of the light so that the sensor often requires a longer exposure time, the captured polarized images are prone to motion blur caused by camera shakes, leading to noticeable degradation in the computed DoP and AoP. Deblurring methods for conventional images often show degenerated performance when handling the polarized images since they only focus on deblurring without considering the polarization constrains. In this paper, we propose a polarized image deblurring pipeline to solve the problem in a polarization-aware manner by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy to explicitly decompose the problem into two less ill-posed sub-problems, and design a two-stage neural network to handle the two sub-problems respectively. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world images, and can improve the performance of polarization-based vision applications such as image dehazing and reflection removal.</p></details> |  | None |

To tackle this challenge, we introduce the U-shaped Vision Mamba (UVM-Net), an efficient single-image dehazing network. Inspired by the State Space Sequence Models (SSMs), a new deep sequence model known for its power to handle long sequences, we design a Bi-SSM block that integrates the local feature extraction ability of the convolutional layer with the ability of the SSM to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

However, as far as we know, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the robustness of the well-trained dehazing models. Therefore, there is no evidence that the dehazing networks can resist malicious attacks. In this paper, we focus on designing a group of attack methods based on first order gradient to verify the robustness of the existing dehazing algorithms. By analyzing the general purpose of image dehazing task, four attack methods are proposed, which are predicted dehazed image attack, hazy layer mask attack, haze-free image attack and haze-preserved attack. The corresponding experiments are conducted on six datasets with different scales. Further, the defense strategy based on adversarial training is adopted for reducing the negative effects caused by malicious attacks. In summary, this paper defines a new challenging problem for the image dehazing area, which can be called as adversarial attack on dehazing networks (AADN).

An existing simple degradation model (similar to atmospheric image "hazing" effects), though helpful, is not sufficient to properly represent the underwater image degradation because there are unaccounted for and non-measurable factors e.g. scattering of light due to turbidity of water, reflective characteristics of turbid medium etc. We propose a deep learning-based architecture to automatically simulate the underwater effects where only a dehazing-like image formation equation is known to the network, and the additional degradation due to the other unknown factors if inferred in a data-driven way. We only use RGB images (because in real-time scenario depth image is not available) to estimate the depth image. For testing, we have proposed (due to the lack of real underwater image datasets) a complex image formation model/equation to manually generate images that resemble real underwater images (used as ground truth). However, only the classical image formation equation (the one used for image dehazing) is informed to the network. This mimics the fact that in a real scenario, the physics are never completely known and only simplified models are known. Thanks to the ground truth, generated by a complex image formation equation, we could successfully perform a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of proposed technique, compared to other purely data driven approaches</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods rely on manually predefined and task-oriented negatives, which often exhibit pronounced task-specific biases. To address this challenge, our paper introduces an innovative method termed 'learning from history', which dynamically generates negative samples from the target model itself. Our approach, named Model Contrastive Learning for Image Restoration (MCLIR), rejuvenates latency models as negative models, making it compatible with diverse image restoration tasks. We propose the Self-Prior guided Negative loss (SPN) to enable it. This approach significantly enhances existing models when retrained with the proposed model contrastive paradigm. The results show significant improvements in image restoration across various tasks and architectures. For example, models retrained with SPN outperform the original FFANet and DehazeFormer by 3.41 dB and 0.57 dB on the RESIDE indoor dataset for image dehazing. Similarly, they achieve notable improvements of 0.47 dB on SPA-Data over IDT for image deraining and 0.12 dB on Manga109 for a 4x scale super-resolution over lightweight SwinIR, respectively.

Existing datasets for training deep learning-based methods can be generated by hand-crafted or synthetic schemes. However, the former often suffers from small scales, while the latter forces models to learn scene depth instead of haze distribution, decreasing their dehazing ability. To overcome the problem, we propose a simple yet novel synthetic method to decouple the relationship between haze density and scene depth, by which a depth-agnostic dataset (DA-HAZE) is generated. Meanwhile, a Global Shuffle Strategy (GSS) is proposed for generating differently scaled datasets, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the model. Extensive experiments indicate that models trained on DA-HAZE achieve significant improvements on real-world benchmarks, with less discrepancy between SOTS and DA-SOTS (the test set of DA-HAZE). Additionally, Depth-agnostic dehazing is a more complicated task because of the lack of depth prior. Therefore, an efficient architecture with stronger feature modeling ability and fewer computational costs is necessary. We revisit the U-Net-based architectures for dehazing, in which dedicatedly designed blocks are incorporated. However, the performances of blocks are constrained by limited feature fusion methods. To this end, we propose a Convolutional Skip Connection (CSC) module, allowing vanilla feature fusion methods to achieve promising results with minimal costs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art methods. equipped with CSC can achieve better performance and reasonable computational expense, whether the haze distribution is relevant to the scene depth.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Haze Removal via Regional Saturation-Value Translation and Soft Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12054v1)** | 2024-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a single image dehazing prior, called Regional Saturation-Value Translation (RSVT), to tackle the color distortion problems caused by conventional dehazing approaches in bright regions. The RSVT prior is developed based on two key observations regarding the relationship between hazy and haze-free points in the HSV color space. First, the hue component shows marginal variation between corresponding hazy and haze-free points, consolidating a hypothesis that the pixel value variability induced by haze primarily occurs in the saturation and value spaces. Second, in the 2D saturation-value coordinate system, most lines passing through hazy-clean point pairs are likely to intersect near the atmospheric light coordinates. Accordingly, haze removal for the bright regions can be performed by properly translating saturation-value coordinates. In addition, an effective soft segmentation method based on a morphological min-max channel is introduced. By combining the soft segmentation mask with the RSVT prior, a comprehensive single image dehazing framework is devised. Experimental results on various synthetic and realistic hazy image datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully addresses color distortion issues and restores visually appealing images.

In this paper, we propose an innovative dehazing framework that operates under non-aligned supervision. This framework is grounded in the atmospheric scattering model, and consists of three interconnected networks: dehazing, airlight, and transmission networks. In particular, we explore a non-alignment scenario that a clear reference image, unaligned with the input hazy image, is utilized to supervise the dehazing network. To implement this, we present a multi-scale reference loss that compares the feature representations between the referred image and the dehazed output. Our scenario makes it easier to collect hazy/clear image pairs in real-world environments, even under conditions of misalignment and shift views. To showcase the effectiveness of our scenario, we have collected a new hazy dataset including 415 image pairs captured by mobile Phone in both rural and urban areas, called "Phone-Hazy". Furthermore, we introduce a self-attention network based on mean and variance for modeling real infinite airlight, using the dark channel prior as positional guidance. Additionally, a channel attention network is employed to estimate the three-channel transmission. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over existing state-of-the-art techniques in the real-world image dehazing task.

Dehazing such images is a vexed and ill-posed problem. Scores of prior-based and learning-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate the effect of haze and generate haze-free images. Many conventional methods are constrained by their lack of awareness regarding scene depth and their incapacity to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, a method that uses residual learning and vision transformers in an attention module is proposed. It essentially comprises two networks: In the first one, the network takes the ratio of a hazy image and the approximated transmission matrix to estimate a residual map. The second network takes this residual image as input and passes it through convolution layers before superposing it on the generated feature maps. It is then passed through global context and depth-aware transformer encoders to obtain channel attention. The attention module then infers the spatial attention map before generating the final haze-free image. Experimental results, including several quantitative metrics, demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the suggested methodology.</p></details> |  | None |

This module employs adaptive transposed self-attention to capture comprehensive context-aware information, facilitating the robust context-aware feature fusion.

Although very competitive dehazing performance has been achieved with sophisticated models, effective solutions for extracting useful features are still under-explored. In addition, non-local network, which has made a breakthrough in many vision tasks, has not been appropriately applied to image dehazing. Thus, a multi-receptive-field non-local network (MRFNLN) consisting of the multi-stream feature attention block (MSFAB) and cross non-local block (CNLB) is presented in this paper. We start with extracting richer features for dehazing. Specifically, we design a multi-stream feature extraction (MSFE) sub-block, which contains three parallel convolutions with different receptive fields (i.e., $1\times 1$, $3\times 3$, $5\times 5$) for extracting multi-scale features. Following MSFE, we employ an attention sub-block to make the model adaptively focus on important channels/regions. The MSFE and attention sub-blocks constitute our MSFAB. Then, we design a cross non-local block (CNLB), which can capture long-range dependencies beyond the query. Instead of the same input source of query branch, the key and value branches are enhanced by fusing more preceding features. CNLB is computation-friendly by leveraging a spatial pyramid down-sampling (SPDS) strategy to reduce the computation and memory consumption without sacrificing the performance. Last but not least, a novel detail-focused contrastive regularization (DFCR) is presented by emphasizing the low-level details and ignoring the high-level semantic information in the representation space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MRFNLN model outperforms recent state-of-the-art dehazing methods with less than 1.5 Million parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE TCYB for possible publication</p></details> | None |

In recent years, deep learning-based methods have achieved success. However, existing image dehazing methods typically neglect the hierarchy of features in the neural network and fail to exploit their relationships fully. To this end, we propose an effective image dehazing method named Hierarchical Contrastive Dehazing (HCD), which is based on feature fusion and contrastive learning strategies. HCD consists of a hierarchical dehazing network (HDN) and a novel hierarchical contrastive loss (HCL). Specifically, the core design in the HDN is a hierarchical interaction module, which utilizes multi-scale activation to revise the feature responses hierarchically. To cooperate with the training of HDN, we propose HCL which performs contrastive learning on hierarchically paired exemplars, facilitating haze removal. Extensive experiments on public datasets, RESIDE, HazeRD, and DENSE-HAZE, demonstrate that HCD quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM and achieves better visual quality.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Frequency Compensated Diffusion Model for Real-scene Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10510v2)** | 2023-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to distribution shift, deep learning based methods for image dehazing suffer from performance degradation when applied to real-world hazy images. In this paper, we consider a dehazing framework based on conditional diffusion models for improved generalization to real haze. First, we find that optimizing the training objective of diffusion models, i.e., Gaussian noise vectors, is non-trivial. The spectral bias of deep networks hinders the higher frequency modes in Gaussian vectors from being learned and hence impairs the reconstruction of image details. To tackle this issue, we design a network unit, named Frequency Compensation block (FCB), with a bank of filters that jointly emphasize the mid-to-high frequencies of an input signal. We demonstrate that diffusion models with FCB achieve significant gains in both perceptual and distortion metrics. Second, to further boost the generalization performance, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline, HazeAug, to augment haze in terms of degree and diversity. Within the framework, a solid baseline for blind dehazing is set up where models are trained on synthetic hazy-clean pairs, and directly generalize to real data. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed dehazing diffusion model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

However, the quadratic computational complexity of softmax-attention limits the wide application in image dehazing task, especially for high-resolution images. To address this issue, we propose a new Transformer variant, which applies the Taylor expansion to approximate the softmax-attention and achieves linear computational complexity. A multi-scale attention refinement module is proposed as a complement to correct the error of the Taylor expansion. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-branch architecture with multi-scale patch embedding to the proposed Transformer, which embeds features by overlapping deformable convolution of different scales. The design of multi-scale patch embedding is based on three key ideas: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field. Our model, named Multi-branch Transformer expanded by Taylor formula (MB-TaylorFormer), can embed coarse to fine features more flexibly at the patch embedding stage and capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost. Experimental results on several dehazing benchmarks show that MB-TaylorFormer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a light computational burden.

Despite the remarkable progress, existing methods still suffer from the following shortcomings: (1) limited exploration of frequency domain information; (2) insufficient information interaction; (3) severe feature redundancy. To remedy these issues, we propose a novel Mutual Information-driven Triple interaction Network (MITNet) based on spatial-frequency dual domain information and two-stage architecture. To be specific, the first stage, named amplitude-guided haze removal, aims to recover the amplitude spectrum of the hazy images for haze removal. And the second stage, named phase-guided structure refined, devotes to learning the transformation and refinement of the phase spectrum. To facilitate the information exchange between two stages, an Adaptive Triple Interaction Module (ATIM) is developed to simultaneously aggregate cross-domain, cross-scale, and cross-stage features, where the fused features are further used to generate content-adaptive dynamic filters so that applying them to enhance global context representation. In addition, we impose the mutual information minimization constraint on paired scale encoder and decoder features from both stages. Such an operation can effectively reduce information redundancy and enhance cross-stage feature complementarity. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets exhibit that our MITNet performs superior performance with lower model complexity.The code and models are available at https://github.com/it-hao/MITNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM MM 2023</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/it-hao/MITNet) |
| **[NightHazeFormer: Single Nighttime Haze Removal Using Prior Query Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09533v3)** | 2023-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nighttime image dehazing is a challenging task due to the presence of multiple types of adverse degrading effects including glow, haze, blurry, noise, color distortion, and so on. However, most previous studies mainly focus on daytime image dehazing or partial degradations presented in nighttime hazy scenes, which may lead to unsatisfactory restoration results. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based framework for nighttime haze removal, called NightHazeFormer. Our proposed approach consists of two stages: supervised pre-training and semi-supervised fine-tuning. During the pre-training stage, we introduce two powerful priors into the transformer decoder to generate the non-learnable prior queries, which guide the model to extract specific degradations. For the fine-tuning, we combine the generated pseudo ground truths with input real-world nighttime hazy images as paired images and feed into the synthetic domain to fine-tune the pre-trained model. This semi-supervised fine-tuning paradigm helps improve the generalization to real domain. In addition, we also propose a large-scale synthetic dataset called UNREAL-NH, to simulate the real-world nighttime haze scenarios comprehensively. Extensive experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our NightHazeFormer over state-of-the-art nighttime haze removal methods in terms of both visually and quantitatively.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[Visibility Enhancement for Low-light Hazy Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00591v1)** | 2023-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light hazy scenes commonly appear at dusk and early morning. The visual enhancement for low-light hazy images is an ill-posed problem. Even though numerous methods have been proposed for image dehazing and low-light enhancement respectively, simply integrating them cannot deliver pleasing results for this particular task. In this paper, we present a novel method to enhance visibility for low-light hazy scenarios. To handle this challenging task, we propose two key techniques, namely cross-consistency dehazing-enhancement framework and physically based simulation for low-light hazy dataset. Specifically, the framework is designed for enhancing visibility of the input image via fully utilizing the clues from different sub-tasks. The simulation is designed for generating the dataset with ground-truths by the proposed low-light hazy imaging model. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the SOTA solutions on different metrics including SSIM (9.19%) and PSNR(5.03%). In addition, we conduct a user study on real images to demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed method by human visual perception.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DFR-Net: Density Feature Refinement Network for Image Dehazing Utilizing Haze Density Difference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13927v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image dehazing task, haze density is a key feature and affects the performance of dehazing methods. However, some of the existing methods lack a comparative image to measure densities, and others create intermediate results but lack the exploitation of their density differences, which can facilitate perception of density. To address these deficiencies, we propose a density-aware dehazing method named Density Feature Refinement Network (DFR-Net) that extracts haze density features from density differences and leverages density differences to refine density features. In DFR-Net, we first generate a proposal image that has lower overall density than the hazy input, bringing in global density differences. Additionally, the dehazing residual of the proposal image reflects the level of dehazing performance and provides local density differences that indicate localized hard dehazing or high density areas. Subsequently, we introduce a Global Branch (GB) and a Local Branch (LB) to achieve density-awareness. In GB, we use Siamese networks for feature extraction of hazy inputs and proposal images, and we propose a Global Density Feature Refinement (GDFR) module that can refine features by pushing features with different global densities further away. In LB, we explore local density features from the dehazing residuals between hazy inputs and proposal images and introduce an Intermediate Dehazing Residual Feedforward (IDRF) module to update local features and pull them closer to clear image features. Sufficient experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results beyond the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uni-Removal: A Semi-Supervised Framework for Simultaneously Addressing Multiple Degradations in Real-World Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05075v1)** | 2023-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Removing multiple degradations, such as haze, rain, and blur, from real-world images poses a challenging and illposed problem. Recently, unified models that can handle different degradations have been proposed and yield promising results. However, these approaches focus on synthetic images and experience a significant performance drop when applied to realworld images. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Removal, a twostage semi-supervised framework for addressing the removal of multiple degradations in real-world images using a unified model and parameters. In the knowledge transfer stage, Uni-Removal leverages a supervised multi-teacher and student architecture in the knowledge transfer stage to facilitate learning from pretrained teacher networks specialized in different degradation types. A multi-grained contrastive loss is introduced to enhance learning from feature and image spaces. In the domain adaptation stage, unsupervised fine-tuning is performed by incorporating an adversarial discriminator on real-world images. The integration of an extended multi-grained contrastive loss and generative adversarial loss enables the adaptation of the student network from synthetic to real-world domains. Extensive experiments on real-world degraded datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We compare our Uni-Removal framework with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods, showcasing its promising results in real-world image dehazing, deraining, and deblurring simultaneously.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Let Segment Anything Help Image Dehaze](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15870v1)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large language model and high-level vision model have achieved impressive performance improvements with large datasets and model sizes. However, low-level computer vision tasks, such as image dehaze and blur removal, still rely on a small number of datasets and small-sized models, which generally leads to overfitting and local optima. Therefore, we propose a framework to integrate large-model prior into low-level computer vision tasks. Just as with the task of image segmentation, the degradation of haze is also texture-related. So we propose to detect gray-scale coding, network channel expansion, and pre-dehaze structures to integrate large-model prior knowledge into any low-level dehazing network. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of large models in guiding low-level visual tasks through different datasets and algorithms comparison experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of grayscale coding, network channel expansion, and recurrent network structures through ablation experiments. Under the conditions where additional data and training resources are not required, we successfully prove that the integration of large-model prior knowledge will improve the dehaze performance and save training time for low-level visual tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Image enhancement algorithms can be used to reduce dust. However, these require dusty and dust-free images of the same environment for validation. In fact, to date, there is no dataset that we are aware of that addresses this issue. Therefore, we present the agriscapes RB-Dust dataset, which is named after its purpose of reference-based dust removal. It is not possible to take pictures from the cabin during tillage, as this would cause shifts in the images. Because of this, we built a setup from which it is possible to take images from a stationary position close to the passing tractor. The test setup was based on a half-sided gate through which the tractor could drive. The field tests were carried out on a farm in Bavaria, Germany, during tillage. During the field tests, other parameters such as soil moisture and wind speed were controlled, as these significantly affect dust development. We validated our dataset with contrast enhancement and image dehazing algorithms and analyzed the generalizability from recordings from the moving tractor. Finally, we demonstrate the application of dust removal based on a high-level vision task, such as person classification. Our empirical study confirms the validity of RB-Dust for vision-based dust removal in agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR Workshop NTIRE 2023.

In our industrial deployment scenario based on remote sensing (RS) images, the quality of image dehazing directly affects the grade of our crop identification and growth monitoring products. However, the widely used peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) provide ambiguous visual interpretation. In this paper, we design a new objective metric for RS image dehazing evaluation. Our proposed metric leverages a ground-based phenology observation resource to calculate the vegetation index error between RS and ground images at a hazy date. Extensive experiments validate that our metric appropriately evaluates different dehazing models and is in line with human visual perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2023 Industry Track</p></details> | None |

On the other hand, the dehazing task should take into account the subjective factor, which is to give the user selectable dehazed images rather than a single result. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-output dehazing network by introducing illumination controllable ability, called IC-Dehazing. The proposed IC-Dehazing can change the illumination intensity by adjusting the factor of the illumination controllable module, which is realized based on the interpretable Retinex theory. Moreover, the backbone dehazing network of IC-Dehazing consists of a Transformer with double decoders for high-quality image restoration. Further, the prior-based loss function and unsupervised training strategy enable IC-Dehazing to complete the parameter learning process without the need for paired data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IC-Dehazing, quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on image dehazing, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks.

Therefore, guidance by estimates of haze parameters related to the variety would be beneficial, and their progressive update jointly with haze reduction will allow effective dehazing. To this end, we propose a multi-network dehazing framework containing novel interdependent dehazing and haze parameter updater networks that operate in a progressive manner. The haze parameters, transmission map and atmospheric light, are first estimated using dedicated convolutional networks that allow color-cast handling. The estimated parameters are then used to guide our dehazing module, where the estimates are progressively updated by novel convolutional networks. The updating takes place jointly with progressive dehazing using a network that invokes inter-step dependencies. The joint progressive updating and dehazing gradually modify the haze parameter values toward achieving effective dehazing. Through different studies, our dehazing framework is shown to be more effective than image-to-image mapping and predefined haze formation model based dehazing. The framework is also found capable of handling a wide variety of hazy conditions wtih different types and amounts of haze and color casts. Our dehazing framework is qualitatively and quantitatively found to outperform the state-of-the-art on synthetic and real-world hazy images of multiple datasets with varied haze conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

| **[Curricular Contrastive Regularization for Physics-aware Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14218v2)** | 2023-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Considering the ill-posed nature, contrastive regularization has been developed for single image dehazing, introducing the information from negative images as a lower bound. However, the contrastive samples are nonconsensual, as the negatives are usually represented distantly from the clear (i.e., positive) image, leaving the solution space still under-constricted. Moreover, the interpretability of deep dehazing models is underexplored towards the physics of the hazing process. In this paper, we propose a novel curricular contrastive regularization targeted at a consensual contrastive space as opposed to a non-consensual one. Our negatives, which provide better lower-bound constraints, can be assembled from 1) the hazy image, and 2) corresponding restorations by other existing methods. Further, due to the different similarities between the embeddings of the clear image and negatives, the learning difficulty of the multiple components is intrinsically imbalanced. To tackle this issue, we customize a curriculum learning strategy to reweight the importance of different negatives. In addition, to improve the interpretability in the feature space, we build a physics-aware dual-branch unit according to the atmospheric scattering model. With the unit, as well as curricular contrastive regularization, we establish our dehazing network, named C2PNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our C2PNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extreme PSNR boosts of 3.94dB and 1.50dB, respectively, on SOTS-indoor and SOTS-outdoor datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR2023</p></details> | None |

Previous studies verified the effectiveness of the large convolutional kernel and attention mechanism in dehazing. However, there are two drawbacks: the multi-scale properties of an image are readily ignored when a large convolutional kernel is introduced, and the standard series connection of an attention module does not sufficiently consider an uneven hazy distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mix Structure Image Dehazing Network (MixDehazeNet), which solves two issues mentioned above. Specifically, it mainly consists of two parts: the multi-scale parallel large convolution kernel module and the enhanced parallel attention module. Compared with a single large kernel, parallel large kernels with multi-scale are more capable of taking partial texture into account during the dehazing phase. In addition, an enhanced parallel attention module is developed, in which parallel connections of attention perform better at dehazing uneven hazy distribution. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. For example, compared with the previous state-of-the-art methods, MixDehazeNet achieves a significant improvement (42.62dB PSNR) on the SOTS indoor dataset.

Most prior methods consider fully supervised training and learn from paired clean and hazy images, where a hazy image is synthesized based on a clean image and its estimated depth map. This paradigm, however, can produce low-quality hazy images due to inaccurate depth estimation, resulting in poor generalization of the trained models. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach for generating paired clean-hazy images by leveraging computer graphics. Using a modern game engine, our approach renders crisp clean images and their precise depth maps, based on which high-quality hazy images can be synthesized for training dehazing models. To this end, we present SimHaze: a new synthetic haze dataset. More importantly, we show that training with SimHaze alone allows the latest dehazing models to achieve significantly better performance in comparison to previous dehazing datasets.

In this paper we present a novel model for ultra high-resolution image restoration, referred to as the Global-Local Stepwise Generative Network (GLSGN), which employs a stepwise restoring strategy involving four restoring pathways: three local pathways and one global pathway. The local pathways focus on conducting image restoration in a fine-grained manner over local but high-resolution image patches, while the global pathway performs image restoration coarsely on the scale-down but intact image to provide cues for the local pathways in a global view including semantics and noise patterns. To smooth the mutual collaboration between these four pathways, our GLSGN is designed to ensure the inter-pathway consistency in four aspects in terms of low-level content, perceptual attention, restoring intensity and high-level semantics, respectively. As another major contribution of this work, we also introduce the first ultra high-resolution dataset to date for both reflection removal and rain streak removal, comprising 4,670 real-world and synthetic images. Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image background restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain streak removal and image dehazing, show that our GLSGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Although the Dehazing models have evolved a lot in recent years, few have precisely tackled the problem of High-Resolution hazy images. For this kind of image, the model needs to work on a downscaled version of the image or on cropped patches from it. In both cases, the accuracy will drop. This is primarily due to the inherent failure to combine global and local features when the image size increases. The Dehazing model requires global features to understand the general scene peculiarities and the local features to work better with fine and pixel details. In this study, we propose the Streamlined Global and Local Features Combinator (SGLC) to solve these issues and to optimize the application of any Dehazing model to High-Resolution images. The SGLC contains two successive blocks. The first is the Global Features Generator (GFG) which generates the first version of the Dehazed image containing strong global features. The second block is the Local Features Enhancer (LFE) which improves the local feature details inside the previously generated image. When tested on the Uformer architecture for Dehazing, SGLC increased the PSNR metric by a significant margin. Any other model can be incorporated inside the SGLC process to improve its efficiency on High-Resolution input data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2023 Workshops</p></details> | None |

However, image degradation caused by the scattering of atmospheric light and object light by particles in the atmosphere can significantly decrease the reconstruction quality when shooting scenes in hazy conditions. To address this issue, we propose Dehazing-NeRF, a method that can recover clear NeRF from hazy image inputs. Our method simulates the physical imaging process of hazy images using an atmospheric scattering model, and jointly learns the atmospheric scattering model and a clean NeRF model for both image dehazing and novel view synthesis. Different from previous approaches, Dehazing-NeRF is an unsupervised method with only hazy images as the input, and also does not rely on hand-designed dehazing priors. By jointly combining the depth estimated from the NeRF 3D scene with the atmospheric scattering model, our proposed model breaks through the ill-posed problem of single-image dehazing while maintaining geometric consistency. Besides, to alleviate the degradation of image quality caused by information loss, soft margin consistency regularization, as well as atmospheric consistency and contrast discriminative loss, are addressed during the model training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the simple combination of single-image dehazing and NeRF on both image dehazing and novel view image synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Data-Centric Solution to NonHomogeneous Dehazing via Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07874v2)** | 2023-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in image dehazing. Many deep learning methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge, and have made significant accomplishments dealing with homogeneous haze. However, these solutions cannot maintain comparable performance when they are applied to images with non-homogeneous haze, e.g., NH-HAZE23 dataset introduced by NTIRE challenges. One of the reasons for such failures is that non-homogeneous haze does not obey one of the assumptions that is required for modeling homogeneous haze. In addition, a large number of pairs of non-homogeneous hazy image and the clean counterpart is required using traditional end-to-end training approaches, while NH-HAZE23 dataset is of limited quantities. Although it is possible to augment the NH-HAZE23 dataset by leveraging other non-homogeneous dehazing datasets, we observe that it is necessary to design a proper data-preprocessing approach that reduces the distribution gaps between the target dataset and the augmented one. This finding indeed aligns with the essence of data-centric AI. With a novel network architecture and a principled data-preprocessing approach that systematically enhances data quality, we present an innovative dehazing method. Specifically, we apply RGB-channel-wise transformations on the augmented datasets, and incorporate the state-of-the-art transformers as the backbone in the two-branch framework.

Existing homogeneous dehazing methods struggle to handle the non-uniform distribution of haze in a robust manner. The crucial challenge of non-homogeneous dehazing is to effectively extract the non-uniform distribution features and reconstruct the details of hazy areas with high quality. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced semi-curricular attention network, called SCANet, for non-homogeneous image dehazing that focuses on enhancing haze-occluded regions. Our approach consists of an attention generator network and a scene reconstruction network. We use the luminance differences of images to restrict the attention map and introduce a self-paced semi-curricular learning strategy to reduce learning ambiguity in the early stages of training.

In this work, we present a new paradigm for real image dehazing from the perspectives of synthesizing more realistic hazy data and introducing more robust priors into the network. Specifically, (1) instead of adopting the de facto physical scattering model, we rethink the degradation of real hazy images and propose a phenomenological pipeline considering diverse degradation types. (2) We propose a Real Image Dehazing network via high-quality Codebook Priors (RIDCP). Firstly, a VQGAN is pre-trained on a large-scale high-quality dataset to obtain the discrete codebook, encapsulating high-quality priors (HQPs). After replacing the negative effects brought by haze with HQPs, the decoder equipped with a novel normalized feature alignment module can effectively utilize high-quality features and produce clean results. However, although our degradation pipeline drastically mitigates the domain gap between synthetic and real data, it is still intractable to avoid it, which challenges HQPs matching in the wild. Thus, we re-calculate the distance when matching the features to the HQPs by a controllable matching operation, which facilitates finding better counterparts. We provide a recommendation to control the matching based on an explainable solution. Users can also flexibly adjust the enhancement degree as per their preference.

The EDN-GTM takes a conventional RGB hazy image in conjunction with the corresponding transmission map estimated by the dark channel prior (DCP) approach as inputs of the network. The EDN-GTM adopts an enhanced structure of U-Net developed for dehazing tasks and the resulting EDN-GDM has shown state-of-the-art performances on benchmark dehazing datasets in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. In order to give an in-depth understanding of the well-designed architecture which largely contributes to the success of the EDN-GTM, extensive experiments and analysis from selecting the core structure of the scheme to investigating advanced network designs are presented in this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 2 figures, ASPAI 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[4K-HAZE: A Dehazing Benchmark with 4K Resolution Hazy and Haze-Free Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15848v1)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, mobile and IoT devices are in dire need of a series of methods to enhance 4K images with limited resource expenditure. The absence of large-scale 4K benchmark datasets hampers progress in this area, especially for dehazing. The challenges in building ultra-high-definition (UHD) dehazing datasets are the absence of estimation methods for UHD depth maps, high-quality 4K depth estimation datasets, and migration strategies for UHD haze images from synthetic to real domains. To address these problems, we develop a novel synthetic method to simulate 4K hazy images (including nighttime and daytime scenes) from clear images, which first estimates the scene depth, simulates the light rays and object reflectance, then migrates the synthetic images to real domains by using a GAN, and finally yields the hazy effects on 4K resolution images. We wrap these synthesized images into a benchmark called the 4K-HAZE dataset. Specifically, we design the CS-Mixer (an MLP-based model that integrates \textbf{C}hannel domain and \textbf{S}patial domain) to estimate the depth map of 4K clear images, the GU-Net to migrate a 4K synthetic image to the real hazy domain. The most appealing aspect of our approach (depth estimation and domain migration) is the capability to run a 4K image on a single GPU with 24G RAM in real-time (33fps). Additionally, this work presents an objective assessment of several state-of-the-art single-image dehazing methods that are evaluated using the 4K-HAZE dataset. At the end of the paper, we discuss the limitations of the 4K-HAZE dataset and its social implications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Preset for Color Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13511v2)** | 2023-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a Neural Preset technique to address the limitations of existing color style transfer methods, including visual artifacts, vast memory requirement, and slow style switching speed. Our method is based on two core designs. First, we propose Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM) to consistently operate on each pixel via an image-adaptive color mapping matrix, avoiding artifacts and supporting high-resolution inputs with a small memory footprint. Second, we develop a two-stage pipeline by dividing the task into color normalization and stylization, which allows efficient style switching by extracting color styles as presets and reusing them on normalized input images. Due to the unavailability of pairwise datasets, we describe how to train Neural Preset via a self-supervised strategy. Various advantages of Neural Preset over existing methods are demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations. Notably, Neural Preset enables stable 4K color style transfer in real-time without artifacts. Besides, we show that our trained model can naturally support multiple applications without fine-tuning, including low-light image enhancement, underwater image correction, image dehazing, and image harmonization.

| **[Reliable Image Dehazing by NeRF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09153v1)** | 2023-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an image dehazing algorithm with high quality, wide application, and no data training or prior needed. We analyze the defects of the original dehazing model, and propose a new and reliable dehazing reconstruction and dehazing model based on the combination of optical scattering model and computer graphics lighting rendering model. Based on the new haze model and the images obtained by the cameras, we can reconstruct the three-dimensional space, accurately calculate the objects and haze in the space, and use the transparency relationship of haze to perform accurate haze removal. To obtain a 3D simulation dataset we used the Unreal 5 computer graphics rendering engine. In order to obtain real shot data in different scenes, we used fog generators, array cameras, mobile phones, underwater cameras and drones to obtain haze data. We use formula derivation, simulation data set and real shot data set result experimental results to prove the feasibility of the new method. Compared with various other methods, we are far ahead in terms of calculation indicators (4 dB higher quality average scene), color remains more natural, and the algorithm is more robust in different scenarios and best in the subjective perception.</p></details> | 12pages, 8figures | None |
| **[Transmission-Guided Bayesian Generative Model for Smoke Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00900v1)** | 2023-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smoke segmentation is essential to precisely localize wildfire so that it can be extinguished in an early phase. Although deep neural networks have achieved promising results on image segmentation tasks, they are prone to be overconfident for smoke segmentation due to its non-rigid shape and transparent appearance. This is caused by both knowledge level uncertainty due to limited training data for accurate smoke segmentation and labeling level uncertainty representing the difficulty in labeling ground-truth. To effectively model the two types of uncertainty, we introduce a Bayesian generative model to simultaneously estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters and its predictions. Further, smoke images suffer from low contrast and ambiguity, inspired by physics-based image dehazing methods, we design a transmission-guided local coherence loss to guide the network to learn pair-wise relationships based on pixel distance and the transmission feature. To promote the development of this field, we also contribute a high-quality smoke segmentation dataset, SMOKE5K, consisting of 1,400 real and 4,000 synthetic images with pixel-wise annotation. Experimental results on benchmark testing datasets illustrate that our model achieves both accurate predictions and reliable uncertainty maps representing model ignorance about its prediction.

| **[DEA-Net: Single image dehazing based on detail-enhanced convolution and content-guided attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04805v1)** | 2023-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem which estimates latent haze-free images from observed hazy images. Some existing deep learning based methods are devoted to improving the model performance via increasing the depth or width of convolution. The learning ability of convolutional neural network (CNN) structure is still under-explored. In this paper, a detail-enhanced attention block (DEAB) consisting of the detail-enhanced convolution (DEConv) and the content-guided attention (CGA) is proposed to boost the feature learning for improving the dehazing performance. Specifically, the DEConv integrates prior information into normal convolution layer to enhance the representation and generalization capacity. Then by using the re-parameterization technique, DEConv is equivalently converted into a vanilla convolution with NO extra parameters and computational cost. By assigning unique spatial importance map (SIM) to every channel, CGA can attend more useful information encoded in features. In addition, a CGA-based mixup fusion scheme is presented to effectively fuse the features and aid the gradient flow. By combining above mentioned components, we propose our detail-enhanced attention network (DEA-Net) for recovering high-quality haze-free images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEA-Net, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by boosting the PSNR index over 41 dB with only 3.653 M parameters. The source code of our DEA-Net will be made available at https://github.com/cecret3350/DEA-Net.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/cecret3350/DEA-Net) |

| **[Realistic Large-Scale Fine-Depth Dehazing Dataset from 3D Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08554v3)** | 2022-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing is one of the important and popular topics in computer vision and machine learning. A reliable real-time dehazing method with reliable performance is highly desired for many applications such as autonomous driving, security surveillance, etc. While recent learning-based methods require datasets containing pairs of hazy images and clean ground truth, it is impossible to capture them in real scenes. Many existing works compromise this difficulty to generate hazy images by rendering the haze from depth on common RGBD datasets using the haze imaging model. However, there is still a gap between the synthetic datasets and real hazy images as large datasets with high-quality depth are mostly indoor and depth maps for outdoor are imprecise. In this paper, we complement the existing datasets with a new, large, and diverse dehazing dataset containing real outdoor scenes from High-Definition (HD) 3D movies. We select a large number of high-quality frames of real outdoor scenes and render haze on them using depth from stereo. Our dataset is clearly more realistic and more diversified with better visual quality than existing ones. More importantly, we demonstrate that using this dataset greatly improves the dehazing performance on real scenes. In addition to the dataset, we also evaluate a series state of the art methods on the proposed benchmarking datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dehazed Image Quality Evaluation: From Partial Discrepancy to Blind Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12636v1)** | 2022-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing aims to restore spatial details from hazy images. There have emerged a number of image dehazing algorithms, designed to increase the visibility of those hazy images. However, much less work has been focused on evaluating the visual quality of dehazed images. In this paper, we propose a Reduced-Reference dehazed image quality evaluation approach based on Partial Discrepancy (RRPD) and then extend it to a No-Reference quality assessment metric with Blind Perception (NRBP). Specifically, inspired by the hierarchical characteristics of the human perceiving dehazed images, we introduce three groups of features: luminance discrimination, color appearance, and overall naturalness. In the proposed RRPD, the combined distance between a set of sender and receiver features is adopted to quantify the perceptually dehazed image quality. By integrating global and local channels from dehazed images, the RRPD is converted to NRBP which does not rely on any information from the references. Extensive experiment results on several dehazed image quality databases demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference, and no-reference quality assessment models. Furthermore, we show that the proposed dehazed image quality evaluation methods can be effectively applied to tune parameters for potential image dehazing algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Non-Homogeneous Haze Removal via Artificial Scene Prior and Bidimensional Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01888v2)** | 2022-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of natural scene and haze prior information, it is greatly challenging to completely remove the haze from a single image without distorting its visual content. Fortunately, the real-world haze usually presents non-homogeneous distribution, which provides us with many valuable clues in partial well-preserved regions. In this paper, we propose a Non-Homogeneous Haze Removal Network (NHRN) via artificial scene prior and bidimensional graph reasoning. Firstly, we employ the gamma correction iteratively to simulate artificial multiple shots under different exposure conditions, whose haze degrees are different and enrich the underlying scene prior. Secondly, beyond utilizing the local neighboring relationship, we build a bidimensional graph reasoning module to conduct non-local filtering in the spatial and channel dimensions of feature maps, which models their long-range dependency and propagates the natural scene prior between the well-preserved nodes and the nodes contaminated by haze. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration to remove non-homogeneous haze via the graph reasoning based framework. We evaluate our method on different benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over many state-of-the-art algorithms for both the single image dehazing and hazy image understanding tasks. The source code of the proposed NHRN is available on https://github.com/whrws/NHRNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/whrws/NHRNet) |
| **[Towards Generalization on Real Domain for Single Image Dehazing via Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07147v1)** | 2022-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based image dehazing methods are essential to assist autonomous systems in enhancing reliability. Due to the domain gap between synthetic and real domains, the internal information learned from synthesized images is usually sub-optimal in real domains, leading to severe performance drop of dehaizing models. Driven by the ability on exploring internal information from a few unseen-domain samples, meta-learning is commonly adopted to address this issue via test-time training, which is hyperparameter-sensitive and time-consuming. In contrast, we present a domain generalization framework based on meta-learning to dig out representative and discriminative internal properties of real hazy domains without test-time training. To obtain representative domain-specific information, we attach two entities termed adaptation network and distance-aware aggregator to our dehazing network. The adaptation network assists in distilling domain-relevant information from a few hazy samples and caching it into a collection of features. The distance-aware aggregator strives to summarize the generated features and filter out misleading information for more representative internal properties. To enhance the discrimination of distilled internal information, we present a novel loss function called domain-relevant contrastive regularization, which encourages the internal features generated from the same domain more similar and that from diverse domains more distinct. The generated representative and discriminative features are regarded as some external variables of our dehazing network to regress a particular and powerful function for a given domain. The extensive experiments on real hazy datasets, such as RTTS and URHI, validate that our proposed method has superior generalization ability than the state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semi-UFormer: Semi-supervised Uncertainty-aware Transformer for Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16057v1)** | 2022-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image dehazing is fundamental yet not well-solved in computer vision. Most cutting-edge models are trained in synthetic data, leading to the poor performance on real-world hazy scenarios. Besides, they commonly give deterministic dehazed images while neglecting to mine their uncertainty. To bridge the domain gap and enhance the dehazing performance, we propose a novel semi-supervised uncertainty-aware transformer network, called Semi-UFormer. Semi-UFormer can well leverage both the real-world hazy images and their uncertainty guidance information. Specifically, Semi-UFormer builds itself on the knowledge distillation framework. Such teacher-student networks effectively absorb real-world haze information for quality dehazing. Furthermore, an uncertainty estimation block is introduced into the model to estimate the pixel uncertainty representations, which is then used as a guidance signal to help the student network produce haze-free images more accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semi-UFormer generalizes well from synthetic to real-world images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[See Blue Sky: Deep Image Dehaze Using Paired and Unpaired Training Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07594v1)** | 2022-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The issue of image haze removal has attracted wide attention in recent years. However, most existing haze removal methods cannot restore the scene with clear blue sky, since the color and texture information of the object in the original haze image is insufficient. To remedy this, we propose a cycle generative adversarial network to construct a novel end-to-end image dehaze model. We adopt outdoor image datasets to train our model, which includes a set of real-world unpaired image dataset and a set of paired image dataset to ensure that the generated images are close to the real scene. Based on the cycle structure, our model adds four different kinds of loss function to constrain the effect including adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, photorealism loss and paired L1 loss. These four constraints can improve the overall quality of such degraded images for better visual appeal and ensure reconstruction of images to keep from distortion. The proposed model could remove the haze of images and also restore the sky of images to be clean and blue (like captured in a sunny weather).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Fourier Up-Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05171v1)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing convolutional neural networks widely adopt spatial down-/up-sampling for multi-scale modeling. However, spatial up-sampling operators (\emph{e.g.}, interpolation, transposed convolution, and un-pooling) heavily depend on local pixel attention, incapably exploring the global dependency. In contrast, the Fourier domain obeys the nature of global modeling according to the spectral convolution theorem. Unlike the spatial domain that performs up-sampling with the property of local similarity, up-sampling in the Fourier domain is more challenging as it does not follow such a local property. In this study, we propose a theoretically sound Deep Fourier Up-Sampling (FourierUp) to solve these issues. We revisit the relationships between spatial and Fourier domains and reveal the transform rules on the features of different resolutions in the Fourier domain, which provide key insights for FourierUp's designs. FourierUp as a generic operator consists of three key components: 2D discrete Fourier transform, Fourier dimension increase rules, and 2D inverse Fourier transform, which can be directly integrated with existing networks. Extensive experiments across multiple computer vision tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, image de-raining, image dehazing, and guided image super-resolution, demonstrate the consistent performance gains obtained by introducing our FourierUp.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by NeurIPS 2022.

| **[A GAN-Based Input-Size Flexibility Model for Single Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09796v2)** | 2022-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-image translation based on generative adversarial network (GAN) has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various image restoration applications. Single image dehazing is a typical example, which aims to obtain the haze-free image of a haze one. This paper concentrates on the challenging task of single image dehazing. Based on the atmospheric scattering model, a novel model is designed to directly generate the haze-free image. The main challenge of image dehazing is that the atmospheric scattering model has two parameters, i.e., transmission map and atmospheric light. When they are estimated respectively, the errors will be accumulated to compromise the dehazing quality. Considering this reason and various image sizes, a novel input-size flexibility conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is proposed for single image dehazing, which is input-size flexibility at both training and test stages for image-to-image translation with cGAN framework. A simple and effective U-connection residual network (UR-Net) is proposed to combine the generator and adopt the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) to design the discriminator. Moreover, the model is trained with multi-loss function, in which the consistency loss is a novel designed loss in this paper. Finally, a multi-scale cGAN fusion model is built to realize state-of-the-art single image dehazing performance. The proposed models receive a haze image as input and directly output a haze-free one. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Signal Processing-Image Communication</p></details> | None |
