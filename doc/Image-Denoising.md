| **[Bilevel Learning with Inexact Stochastic Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12049v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bilevel learning has gained prominence in machine learning, inverse problems, and imaging applications, including hyperparameter optimization, learning data-adaptive regularizers, and optimizing forward operators. The large-scale nature of these problems has led to the development of inexact and computationally efficient methods. Existing adaptive methods predominantly rely on deterministic formulations, while stochastic approaches often adopt a doubly-stochastic framework with impractical variance assumptions, enforces a fixed number of lower-level iterations, and requires extensive tuning. In this work, we focus on bilevel learning with strongly convex lower-level problems and a nonconvex sum-of-functions in the upper-level. Stochasticity arises from data sampling in the upper-level which leads to inexact stochastic hypergradients. We establish their connection to state-of-the-art stochastic optimization theory for nonconvex objectives. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization under mild assumptions. Our empirical results highlight significant speed-ups and improved generalization in imaging tasks such as image denoising and deblurring in comparison with adaptive deterministic bilevel methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 10th International Conference on Scale Space and Variational Methods in Computer Vision (SSVM 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Denoising via Repainting: an image denoising method using layer wise medical image repainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08094v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image denoising is essential for improving the reliability of clinical diagnosis and guiding subsequent image-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale approach that integrates anisotropic Gaussian filtering with progressive Bezier-path redrawing. Our method constructs a scale-space pyramid to mitigate noise while preserving critical structural details. Starting at the coarsest scale, we segment partially denoised images into coherent components and redraw each using a parametric Bezier path with representative color. Through iterative refinements at finer scales, small and intricate structures are accurately reconstructed, while large homogeneous regions remain robustly smoothed. We employ both mean square error and self-intersection constraints to maintain shape coherence during path optimization. Empirical results on multiple MRI datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in PSNR and SSIM over competing methods. This coarse-to-fine framework offers a robust, data-efficient solution for cross-domain denoising, reinforcing its potential clinical utility and versatility. Future work extends this technique to three-dimensional data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Whiteness-based bilevel estimation of weighted TV parameter maps for image denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07814v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a bilevel optimisation strategy based on normalised residual whiteness loss for estimating the weighted total variation parameter maps for denoising images corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. Compared to supervised and semi-supervised approaches relying on prior knowledge of (approximate) reference data and/or information on the noise magnitude, the proposal is fully unsupervised. To avoid noise overfitting an early stopping strategy is used, relying on simple statistics of optimal performances on a set of natural images. Numerical results comparing the supervised/unsupervised procedures for scalar/pixel-dependent \mbox{parameter maps are shown.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Personalized Generative Low-light Image Denoising and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14327v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While smartphone cameras today can produce astonishingly good photos, their performance in low light is still not completely satisfactory because of the fundamental limits in photon shot noise and sensor read noise. Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Plug-and-Play Posterior Sampling under Mismatched Measurement and Prior Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03546v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Posterior sampling has been shown to be a powerful Bayesian approach for solving imaging inverse problems. The recent plug-and-play unadjusted Langevin algorithm (PnP-ULA) has emerged as a promising method for Monte Carlo sampling and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation by combining physical measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers. However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA and the mismatched data-fidelity and denoiser has not been theoretically analyzed. We address this gap by proposing a posterior-L2 pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on several inverse problems such as sampling from Gaussian mixture models and image deblurring. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the sampling distribution of PnP-ULA to a mismatch in the measurement model and the denoiser can be precisely characterized.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NIR-Assisted Image Denoising: A Selective Fusion Approach and A Real-World Benchmark Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08514v4)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant progress in image denoising, it is still challenging to restore fine-scale details while removing noise, especially in extremely low-light environments. Leveraging near-infrared (NIR) images to assist visible RGB image denoising shows the potential to address this issue, becoming a promising technology. Nonetheless, existing works still struggle with taking advantage of NIR information effectively for real-world image denoising, due to the content inconsistency between NIR-RGB images and the scarcity of real-world paired datasets. To alleviate the problem, we propose an efficient Selective Fusion Module (SFM), which can be plug-and-played into the advanced denoising networks to merge the deep NIR-RGB features. Specifically, we sequentially perform the global and local modulation for NIR and RGB features, and then integrate the two modulated features. Furthermore, we present a Real-world NIR-Assisted Image Denoising (Real-NAID) dataset, which covers diverse scenarios as well as various noise levels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and our real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better results than state-of-the-art ones. The dataset, codes, and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ronjonxu/NAID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ronjonxu/NAID) |
| **[Two-stage Deep Denoising with Self-guided Noise Attention for Multimodal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06827v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image denoising is considered among the most challenging vision tasks. Despite the real-world implications, existing denoising methods have notable drawbacks as they often generate visual artifacts when applied to heterogeneous medical images. This study addresses the limitation of the contemporary denoising methods with an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven two-stage learning strategy. The proposed method learns to estimate the residual noise from the noisy images. Later, it incorporates a novel noise attention mechanism to correlate estimated residual noise with noisy inputs to perform denoising in a course-to-refine manner. This study also proposes to leverage a multi-modal learning strategy to generalize the denoising among medical image modalities and multiple noise patterns for widespread applications. The practicability of the proposed method has been evaluated with dense experiments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance by significantly outperforming the existing medical image denoising methods in quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Overall, it illustrates a performance gain of 7.64 in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), 0.1021 in Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), 0.80 in DeltaE ($\Delta E$), 0.1855 in Visual Information Fidelity Pixel-wise (VIFP), and 18.54 in Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences (2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[Revisiting the Generalization Problem of Low-level Vision Models Through the Lens of Image Deraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12600v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization remains a significant challenge for low-level vision models, which often struggle with unseen degradations in real-world scenarios despite their success in controlled benchmarks. In this paper, we revisit the generalization problem in low-level vision models. Image deraining is selected as a case study due to its well-defined and easily decoupled structure, allowing for more effective observation and analysis. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that the generalization issue is not primarily due to limited network capacity but rather the failure of existing training strategies, which leads networks to overfit specific degradation patterns. Our findings show that guiding networks to focus on learning the underlying image content, rather than the degradation patterns, is key to improving generalization. We demonstrate that balancing the complexity of background images and degradations in the training data helps networks better fit the image distribution. Furthermore, incorporating content priors from pre-trained generative models significantly enhances generalization. Experiments on both image deraining and image denoising validate the proposed strategies. We believe the insights and solutions will inspire further research and improve the generalization of low-level vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2305.15134</p></details> | None |
| **[Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise: Self-Supervised Medical Image Denoising from Single Noisy Image Volume](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10831v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the last few years, with the rapid development of deep learning technologies, supervised methods based on convolutional neural networks have greatly enhanced the performance of medical image denoising. However, these methods require large quantities of noisy-clean image pairs for training, which greatly limits their practicality. Although some researchers have attempted to train denoising networks using only single noisy images, existing self-supervised methods, including blind-spot-based and data-splitting-based methods, heavily rely on the assumption that noise is pixel-wise independent. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world medical images. Therefore, in the field of medical imaging, there remains a lack of simple and practical denoising methods that can achieve high-quality denoising performance using only single noisy images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised medical image denoising method, Neighboring Slice Noise2Noise (NS-N2N). The proposed method utilizes neighboring slices within a single noisy image volume to construct weighted training data, and then trains the denoising network using a self-supervised scheme with regional consistency loss and inter-slice continuity loss. NS-N2N only requires a single noisy image volume obtained from one medical imaging procedure to achieve high-quality denoising of the image volume itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods in both denoising performance and processing efficiency. Furthermore, since NS-N2N operates solely in the image domain, it is free from device-specific issues such as reconstruction geometry, making it easier to apply in various clinical practices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Development and Enhancement of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05149v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research focuses on the development and enhancement of text-to-image denoising diffusion models, addressing key challenges such as limited sample diversity and training instability. By incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) techniques, this study significantly improves image quality, diversity, and stability. Utilizing Hugging Face's state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model, the proposed enhancements establish new benchmarks in generative AI. This work explores the underlying principles of diffusion models, implements advanced strategies to overcome existing limitations, and presents a comprehensive evaluation of the improvements achieved. Results demonstrate substantial progress in generating stable, diverse, and high-quality images from textual descriptions, advancing the field of generative artificial intelligence and providing new foundations for future applications.

| **[Deep unrolling for learning optimal spatially varying regularisation parameters for Total Generalised Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16532v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend a recently introduced deep unrolling framework for learning spatially varying regularisation parameters in inverse imaging problems to the case of Total Generalised Variation (TGV). The framework combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) inferring the two spatially varying TGV parameters with an unrolled algorithmic scheme that solves the corresponding variational problem. The two subnetworks are jointly trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion and as such the CNN learns to compute those parameters that drive the reconstructed images as close to the ground truth as possible. Numerical results in image denoising and MRI reconstruction show a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement compared to the best TGV scalar parameter case as well as to other approaches employing spatially varying parameters computed by unsupervised methods. We also observe that the inferred spatially varying parameter maps have a consistent structure near the image edges, asking for further theoretical investigations. In particular, the parameter that weighs the first-order TGV term has a triple-edge structure with alternating high-low-high values whereas the one that weighs the second-order term attains small values in a large neighbourhood around the edges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Noise2Score3D:Unsupervised Tweedie's Approach for Point Cloud Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16826v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on recent advances in Bayesian statistics and image denoising, we propose Noise2Score3D, a fully unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising that addresses the critical challenge of limited availability of clean data. Noise2Score3D learns the gradient of the underlying point cloud distribution directly from noisy data, eliminating the need for clean data during training. By leveraging Tweedie's formula, our method performs inference in a single step, avoiding the iterative processes used in existing unsupervised methods, thereby improving both performance and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Noise2Score3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, outperforming other unsupervised methods in Chamfer distance and point-to-mesh metrics, and rivaling some supervised approaches. Furthermore, Noise2Score3D demonstrates strong generalization ability beyond training datasets. Additionally, we introduce Total Variation for Point Cloud, a criterion that allows for the estimation of unknown noise parameters, which further enhances the method's versatility and real-world utility.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Geodesic Diffusion Models for Medical Image-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00745v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models transform an unknown data distribution into a Gaussian prior by progressively adding noise until the data become indistinguishable from pure noise. This stochastic process traces a path in probability space, evolving from the original data distribution (considered as a Gaussian with near-zero variance) to an isotropic Gaussian. The denoiser then learns to reverse this process, generating high-quality samples from random Gaussian noise. However, standard diffusion models, such as the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), do not ensure a geodesic (i.e., shortest) path in probability space. This inefficiency necessitates the use of many intermediate time steps, leading to high computational costs in training and sampling. To address this limitation, we propose the Geodesic Diffusion Model (GDM), which defines a geodesic path under the Fisher-Rao metric with a variance-exploding noise scheduler. This formulation transforms the data distribution into a Gaussian prior with minimal energy, significantly improving the efficiency of diffusion models. We trained GDM by continuously sampling time steps from 0 to 1 and using as few as 15 evenly spaced time steps for model sampling. We evaluated GDM on two medical image-to-image generation tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by a 50-fold compared to DDPM and 10-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, with 66 times faster sampling than DDPM and a similar sampling speed to Fast-DDPM. These efficiency gains enable rapid model exploration and real-time clinical applications.

| **[Self-supervised conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in Poisson imaging problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19194v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration problems are often ill-posed, leading to significant uncertainty in reconstructed images. Accurately quantifying this uncertainty is essential for the reliable interpretation of reconstructed images. However, image restoration methods often lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. Conformal prediction offers a rigorous framework to augment image restoration methods with accurate uncertainty quantification estimates, but it typically requires abundant ground truth data for calibration. This paper presents a self-supervised conformal prediction method for Poisson imaging problems which leverages Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator to eliminate the need for ground truth data. The resulting self-calibrating conformal prediction approach is applicable to any Poisson linear imaging problem that is ill-conditioned, and is particularly effective when combined with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques trained directly on measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring; its performance are comparable to supervised conformal prediction methods relying on ground truth data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CCDM: Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03546v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables (aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM) |
| **[PFCM: Poisson flow consistency models for low-dose CT image denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08159v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used for medical diagnosis and treatment planning; however, concerns about ionizing radiation exposure drive efforts to optimize image quality at lower doses. This study introduces Poisson Flow Consistency Models (PFCM), a novel family of deep generative models that combines the robustness of PFGM++ with the efficient single-step sampling of consistency models. PFCM are derived by generalizing consistency distillation to PFGM++ through a change-of-variables and an updated noise distribution. As a distilled version of PFGM++, PFCM inherit the ability to trade off robustness for rigidity via the hyperparameter $D \in (0,\infty)$. A fact that we exploit to adapt this novel generative model for the task of low-dose CT image denoising, via a ``task-specific'' sampler that ``hijacks'' the generative process by replacing an intermediate state with the low-dose CT image. While this ``hijacking'' introduces a severe mismatch -- the noise characteristics of low-dose CT images are different from that of intermediate states in the Poisson flow process -- we show that the inherent robustness of PFCM at small $D$ effectively mitigates this issue. The resulting sampler achieves excellent performance in terms of LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR on the Mayo low-dose CT dataset. By contrast, an analogous sampler based on standard consistency models is found to be significantly less robust under the same conditions, highlighting the importance of a tunable $D$ afforded by our novel framework. To highlight generalizability, we show effective denoising of clinical images from a prototype photon-counting system reconstructed using a sharper kernel and at a range of energy levels.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Is Noise Conditioning Necessary for Denoising Generative Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13129v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is widely believed that noise conditioning is indispensable for denoising diffusion models to work successfully. This work challenges this belief. Motivated by research on blind image denoising, we investigate a variety of denoising-based generative models in the absence of noise conditioning. To our surprise, most models exhibit graceful degradation, and in some cases, they even perform better without noise conditioning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the error caused by removing noise conditioning and demonstrate that our analysis aligns with empirical observations. We further introduce a noise-unconditional model that achieves a competitive FID of 2.23 on CIFAR-10, significantly narrowing the gap to leading noise-conditional models. We hope our findings will inspire the community to revisit the foundations and formulations of denoising generative models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploiting network optimization stability for enhanced PET image denoising using deep image prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11259v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PET is affected by statistical noise due to constraints on tracer dose and scan duration, impacting both diagnostic performance and quantitative accuracy. While deep learning (DL)-based PET denoising methods have been used to improve image quality, they may introduce over-smoothing, compromising quantitative accuracy. We propose a method for making a DL solution more reliable and apply it to the conditional deep image prior (DIP). We introduce the idea of stability information in the optimization process of conditional DIP, enabling the identification of unstable regions within the network's optimization trajectory. Our method incorporates a stability map, which is derived from multiple intermediate outputs of moderate network at different optimization steps. The final denoised image is then obtained by computing linear combination of the DIP output and the original reconstructed image, weighted by the stability map. Our method effectively reduces noise while preserving small structure details in brain FDG images. Results demonstrated that our approach outperformed existing methods in peak-to-valley ratio and noise suppression across various low-dose levels. Region-of-interest analysis confirmed that the proposed method maintains quantitative accuracy without introducing under- or over-estimation. We applied our method to full-dose PET data to assess its impact on image quality. The results revealed that the proposed method significantly reduced background noise while preserving the peak-to-valley ratio at a level comparable to that of unfiltered full-dose PET images. The proposed method introduces a robust approach to DL-based PET denoising, enhancing its reliability and preserving quantitative accuracy. This strategy has the potential to advance performance in high-sensitivity PET scanners, demonstrating that DL can extend PET imaging capabilities beyond low-dose applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Residual Transformer Fusion Network for Salt and Pepper Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09000v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used in unstructured datasets, one of which is image denoising. Image denoising is a noisy image reconstruction process that aims to reduce additional noise that occurs from the noisy image with various strategies. Image denoising has a problem, namely that some image denoising methods require some prior knowledge of information about noise. To overcome this problem, a combined architecture of Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) and Residual Networks (ResNet) is used which is called the Residual Transformer Fusion Network (RTF-Net). In general, the process in this architecture can be divided into two parts, Noise Suppression Network (NSN) and Structure Enhancement Network (SEN). Residual Block is used in the Noise Suppression Network and is used to learn the noise map in the image, while the CvT is used in the Structure Enhancement Network and is used to learn the details that need to be added to the image processed by the Noise Suppression Network. The model was trained using the DIV2K Training Set dataset, and validation using the DIV2K Validation Set. After doing the training, the model was tested using Lena, Bridge, Pepper, and BSD300 images with noise levels ranging from 30%, 50%, and 70% and the PSNR results were compared with the DBA, NASNLM, PARIGI, NLSF, NLSF-MLP and NLSF-CNN methods. The test results show that the proposed method is superior in all cases except for Pepper's image with a noise level of 30%, where NLSF-CNN is superior with a PSNR value of 32.99 dB, while the proposed method gets a PSNR value of 31.70 dB.</p></details> | 8 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[Prompt-SID: Learning Structural Representation Prompt via Latent Diffusion for Single-Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06432v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many studies have concentrated on constructing supervised models utilizing paired datasets for image denoising, which proves to be expensive and time-consuming. Current self-supervised and unsupervised approaches typically rely on blind-spot networks or sub-image pairs sampling, resulting in pixel information loss and destruction of detailed structural information, thereby significantly constraining the efficacy of such methods. In this paper, we introduce Prompt-SID, a prompt-learning-based single image denoising framework that emphasizes preserving of structural details. This approach is trained in a self-supervised manner using downsampled image pairs. It captures original-scale image information through structural encoding and integrates this prompt into the denoiser. To achieve this, we propose a structural representation generation model based on the latent diffusion process and design a structural attention module within the transformer-based denoiser architecture to decode the prompt. Additionally, we introduce a scale replay training mechanism, which effectively mitigates the scale gap from images of different resolutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic, real-world, and fluorescence imaging datasets, showcasing the remarkable effectiveness of Prompt-SID.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Comparing Image Segmentation Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06201v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for denoising binary images using simulated annealing (SA), a global optimization technique that addresses the inherent challenges of non convex energy functions. Binary images are often corrupted by noise, necessitating effective restoration methods. We propose an energy function E(x, y) that captures the relationship between the noisy image y and the desired clean image x. Our algorithm combines simulated annealing with a localized optimization strategy to efficiently navigate the solution space, minimizing the energy function while maintaining computational efficiency. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method against traditional iterative conditional modes (ICM), employing a binary image with 10% pixel corruption as a test case. Experimental results demonstrate that the simulated annealing method achieves a significant restoration improvement, yielding a 99.19% agreement with the original image compared to 96.21% for ICM. Visual assessments reveal that simulated annealing effectively removes noise while preserving structural details, making it a promising approach for binary image denoising. This work contributes to the field of image processing by highlighting the advantages of incorporating global optimization techniques in restoration tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-supervised Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty Quantification in Imaging Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05127v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most image restoration problems are ill-conditioned or ill-posed and hence involve significant uncertainty. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  | None |

This comprehensive review synthesizes the rapid advancements in GAN-based LDCT denoising techniques, examining the evolution from foundational architectures to state-of-the-art models incorporating advanced features such as anatomical priors, perceptual loss functions, and innovative regularization strategies. We critically analyze various GAN architectures, including conditional GANs (cGANs), CycleGANs, and Super-Resolution GANs (SRGANs), elucidating their unique strengths and limitations in the context of LDCT denoising. The evaluation provides both qualitative and quantitative results related to the improvements in performance in benchmark and clinical datasets with metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. After highlighting the positive results, we discuss some of the challenges preventing a wider clinical use, including the interpretability of the images generated by GANs, synthetic artifacts, and the need for clinically relevant metrics. The review concludes by highlighting the essential significance of GAN-based methodologies in the progression of precision medicine via tailored LDCT denoising models, underlining the transformative possibilities presented by artificial intelligence within contemporary radiological practice.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Patch Triplet Similarity Purification for Guided Real-World Low-Dose CT Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00253v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image denoising of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is an important problem for clinical diagnosis with reduced radiation exposure. Previous methods are mostly trained with pairs of synthetic or misaligned LDCT and normal-dose CT (NDCT) images. However, trained with synthetic noise or misaligned LDCT/NDCT image pairs, the denoising networks would suffer from blurry structure or motion artifacts. Since non-contrast CT (NCCT) images share the content characteristics to the corresponding NDCT images in a three-phase scan, they can potentially provide useful information for real-world LDCT image denoising. To exploit this aspect, in this paper, we propose to incorporate clean NCCT images as useful guidance for the learning of real-world LDCT image denoising networks. To alleviate the issue of spatial misalignment in training data, we design a new Patch Triplet Similarity Purification (PTSP) strategy to select highly similar patch (instead of image) triplets of LDCT, NDCT, and NCCT images for network training. Furthermore, we modify two image denoising transformers of SwinIR and HAT to accommodate the NCCT image guidance, by replacing vanilla self-attention with cross-attention. On our collected clinical dataset, the modified transformers trained with the data selected by our PTSP strategy show better performance than 15 comparison methods on real-world LDCT image denoising. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our NCCT image guidance and PTSP strategy. We will publicly release our data and code.</p></details> |  | None |

Over multiple iterations, the model's performance improves--raising a crucial question: how should the total budget on generation and training be allocated across iterations to maximize final performance? In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze budget allocation strategies. Specifically, we show that constant policies fail to converge with high probability, while increasing policies--particularly exponential growth policies--exhibit significant theoretical advantages. Experiments on image denoising with diffusion probabilistic models and math reasoning with large language models show that both exponential and polynomial growth policies consistently outperform constant policies, with exponential policies often providing more stable performance.</p></details> |  | None |

To perform image denoising, penalized least-squares (PLS) problems can be designed and solved, in which the penalty term encodes prior knowledge of the object being imaged. Sparsity-promoting penalties, such as total variation (TV), have been a popular choice for regularizing image denoising problems. However, such hand-crafted penalties may not be able to preserve task-relevant information in measured image data and can lead to oversmoothed image appearances and patchy artifacts that degrade signal detectability. Supervised learning methods that employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a popular approach to denoising medical images. However, studies have shown that CNNs trained with loss functions based on traditional image quality measures can lead to a loss of task-relevant information in images. Some previous works have investigated task-based loss functions that employ model observers for training the CNN denoising models. However, such training processes typically require a large number of noisy and ground-truth (noise-free or low-noise) image data pairs. In this work, we propose a task-based regularization strategy for use with PLS in medical image denoising. The proposed task-based regularization is associated with the likelihood of linear test statistics of noisy images for Gaussian noise models. The proposed method does not require ground-truth image data and solves an individual optimization problem for denoising each image. Computer-simulation studies are conducted that consider a multivariate-normally distributed (MVN) lumpy background and a binary texture background. It is demonstrated that the proposed regularization strategy can effectively improve signal detectability in denoised images.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE ...</summary><p>SPIE Medical Imaging 2025</p></details> | None |

However, traditional denoising methods, which often assume uniform noise distributions, struggle to handle the non-uniform noise commonly present in MRI images. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts framework for MRI image denoising. Each expert is a specialized denoising convolutional neural network fine-tuned to target specific noise characteristics associated with different image regions. Our method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art denoising techniques on both synthetic and real-world brain MRI datasets. Furthermore, we show that it generalizes effectively to unseen datasets, highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the WACV Workshop on Image Quality</p></details> | None |

Therefore, automatic image denoising using deep learning methods is of high interest. MR images containing line-like structures such as roots or vessels yield special characteristics as they display connected structures and yield sparse information. For this kind of data, it is important to consider voxel neighborhoods when training a denoising network. In this paper, we translate the Perceptual Loss to 3D data by comparing feature maps of untrained networks in the loss function as done previously for 2D data. We tested the performance of untrained Perceptual Loss (uPL) on 3D image denoising of MR images displaying brain vessels (MR angiograms - MRA) and images of plant roots in soil. We investigate the impact of various uPL characteristics such as weight initialization, network depth, kernel size, and pooling operations on the results. We tested the performance of the uPL loss on four Rician noise levels using evaluation metrics such as the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM). We observe, that our uPL outperforms conventional loss functions such as the L1 loss or a loss based on the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM). The uPL network's initialization is not important, while network depth and pooling operations impact denoising performance. E.g. for both datasets a network with five convolutional layers led to the best performance while a network with more layers led to a performance drop. We also find that small uPL networks led to better or comparable results than using large networks such as VGG. We observe superior performance of our loss for both datasets, all noise levels, and three network architectures. In conclusion, for images containing line-like structures, uPL is an alternative to other loss functions for 3D image denoising.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based approach using simulated images. Using density functional theory calculations with a set of pseudo-atomic orbital basis sets, we generate highly accurate ground truth images. We introduce four types of noise into these simulations to create realistic training datasets. Each type of noise is then used to train a separate convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our results show that these CNNs are effective in reducing noise, even when applied to images with different noise levels than those used during training. However, we observe limitations in some cases, particularly in preserving the integrity of circular shapes and avoiding visible artifacts between image patches. To overcome these challenges, we propose alternative training strategies and future research directions. This study provides a valuable framework for training deep learning models for TEM image denoising.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages and 4 figures</p></details> | None |

However, obtaining complete optical remote sensing images is challenging due to cloud cover. Reconstructing cloud-free optical images has become a major task in recent years. This paper presents a two-flow Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR)-Optical data fusion cloud removal algorithm (PODF-CR), which achieves the reconstruction of missing optical images. PODF-CR consists of an encoding module and a decoding module. The encoding module includes two parallel branches that extract PolSAR image features and optical image features. To address speckle noise in PolSAR images, we introduce dynamic filters in the PolSAR branch for image denoising. To better facilitate the fusion between multimodal optical images and PolSAR images, we propose fusion blocks based on cross-skip connections to enable interaction of multimodal data information. The obtained fusion features are refined through an attention mechanism to provide better conditions for the subsequent decoding of the fused images. In the decoding module, multi-scale convolution is introduced to obtain multi-scale information. Additionally, to better utilize comprehensive scattering information and polarization characteristics to assist in the restoration of optical images, we use a dataset for cloud restoration called OPT-BCFSAR-PFSAR, which includes backscatter coefficient feature images and polarization feature images obtained from PoLSAR data and optical images. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when input images exhibit low entropy and sparse, the inherent characteristics of diffusion models often result in limited diversity. This constraint significantly interferes with data augmentation. To address this, we propose Diffusion Prism, a training-free framework that efficiently transforms binary masks into realistic and diverse samples while preserving morphological features. We explored that a small amount of artificial noise will significantly assist the image-denoising process. To prove this novel mask-to-image concept, we use nano-dendritic patterns as an example to demonstrate the merit of our method compared to existing controllable diffusion models. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to other biological patterns, highlighting its potential applications across various fields.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces an ML paradigm inspired by domain knowledge of the structure of output function, akin to physics-informed ML, but rooted in probabilistic principles rather than physical laws. The proposed approach integrates the probabilistic structure of the target variable (such as its cumulative distribution function) into the training process. This probabilistic information is obtained from historical data or estimated using structural reliability methods during experimental design. By embedding domain-specific probabilistic insights into the learning process, the technique enhances model accuracy and mitigates risks of overfitting and underfitting. Applications in regression, image denoising, and classification demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in addressing real-world problems.</p></details> |  | None |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

However, the relatively long acquisition time limits its broader application. To address this issue, this study presents an innovative conditional guided diffusion model, named as TC-KANRecon, which incorporates the Multi-Free U-KAN (MF-UKAN) module and a dynamic clipping strategy. TC-KANRecon model aims to accelerate the MRI reconstruction process through deep learning methods while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed images. The MF-UKAN module can effectively balance the tradeoff between image denoising and structure preservation. Specifically, it presents the multi-head attention mechanisms and scalar modulation factors, which significantly enhances the model's robustness and structure preservation capabilities in complex noise environments. Moreover, the dynamic clipping strategy in TC-KANRecon adjusts the cropping interval according to the sampling steps, thereby mitigating image detail loss typicalching the visual features of the images. Furthermore, the MC-Model incorporates full-sampling k-space information, realizing efficient fusion of conditional information, enhancing the model's ability to process complex data, and improving the realism and detail richness of reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other MRI reconstruction methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, TC-KANRecon method exhibits excellent reconstruction results when processing high-noise, low-sampling-rate MRI data.

Available methods in the vast literature on image denoising can address certain issues in image denoising, but no one single method can solve all such issues. For example, jump regression based methods can preserve linear edges well, but cannot preserve many other fine details of an image. On the other hand, local clustering based methods can preserve fine edge structures, but cannot perform well in presence of heavy noise. The proposed method uses various shapes and sizes of local neighborhood based on local information, and integrates this adaptive approach with the local clustering based smoothing. Theoretical justifications and numerical studies show that the proposed method indeed performs better than these two individual methods and outperforms many other state-of-the-art techniques as well. Such performance demonstrates vast potential of the applicability of the proposed method in many modern-day applications.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures | None |

Current noise synthesis techniques struggle to accurately model complex noise distributions. We propose a novel Realistic Noise Synthesis Diffusor (RNSD) method using diffusion models to address these challenges. By encoding camera settings into a time-aware camera-conditioned affine modulation (TCCAM), RNSD generates more realistic noise distributions under various camera conditions. Additionally, RNSD integrates a multi-scale content-aware module (MCAM), enabling the generation of structured noise with spatial correlations across multiple frequencies. We also introduce Deep Image Prior Sampling (DIPS), a learnable sampling sequence based on depth image prior, which significantly accelerates the sampling process while maintaining the high quality of synthesized noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RNSD method significantly outperforms existing techniques in synthesizing realistic noise under multiple metrics and improving image denoising performance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 | None |

Deep learning can be powerful for such tasks, but surprisingly their combination with a focus on interpretability and generalizability is rarely explored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for interpretable deep image decomposition, combining hierarchical Bayesian modeling and deep learning to create an architecture-modularized and model-generalizable deep neural network (DNN). The proposed framework includes three steps: (1) hierarchical Bayesian modeling of image decomposition, (2) transforming the inference problem into optimization tasks, and (3) deep inference via a modularized Bayesian DNN. We further establish a theoretical connection between the loss function and the generalization error bound, which inspires a new test-time adaptation approach for out-of-distribution scenarios. We instantiated the application using two downstream tasks, \textit{i.e.}, image denoising, and unsupervised anomaly detection, and the results demonstrated improved generalizability as well as interpretability of our methods.

State-of-the-art solutions for this task rely on predicting masked pixels with a fully-convolutional neural network. This most often requires multiple forward passes, information about the noise model, or intricate regularization functions. In this paper, we propose a Swin Transformer-based Image Autoencoder (SwinIA), the first fully-transformer architecture for self-supervised denoising. The flexibility of the attention mechanism helps to fulfill the blind-spot property that convolutional counterparts normally approximate. SwinIA can be trained end-to-end with a simple mean squared error loss without masking and does not require any prior knowledge about clean data or noise distribution. Simple to use, SwinIA establishes the state of the art on several common benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

The introduction of near-infrared (NIR) images offers new possibilities for RGB image denoising. However, due to the inconsistency between NIR and RGB images, the existing works still struggle to balance the contributions of two fields in the process of image fusion. In response to this, in this paper, we develop a cross-field Frequency Correlation Exploiting Network (FCENet) for NIR-assisted image denoising. We first propose the frequency correlation prior based on an in-depth statistical frequency analysis of NIR-RGB image pairs. The prior reveals the complementary correlation of NIR and RGB images in the frequency domain. Leveraging frequency correlation prior, we then establish a frequency learning framework composed of Frequency Dynamic Selection Mechanism (FDSM) and Frequency Exhaustive Fusion Mechanism (FEFM). FDSM dynamically selects complementary information from NIR and RGB images in the frequency domain, and FEFM strengthens the control of common and differential features during the fusion of NIR and RGB features. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data validate that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality and computational efficiency.

The obstacle to clean image acquisition in real scenarios necessitates the development of self-supervised image denoising methods only depending on noisy images, especially a single noisy image. Existing self-supervised image denoising paradigms (Noise2Noise and Noise2Void) rely heavily on information-lossy operations, such as downsampling and masking, culminating in low quality denoising performance. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised single image denoising paradigm, Positive2Negative, to break the information-lossy barrier. Our paradigm involves two key steps: Renoised Data Construction (RDC) and Denoised Consistency Supervision (DCS). RDC renoises the predicted denoised image by the predicted noise to construct multiple noisy images, preserving all the information of the original image. DCS ensures consistency across the multiple denoised images, supervising the network to learn robust denoising. Our Positive2Negative paradigm achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised single image denoising with significant speed improvements.

However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of "all-in-one" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

While conventional strategies -- such as domain-specific augmentation, specialized architectures, and tailored training procedures -- can alleviate these issues, they depend on the availability and reliability of domain knowledge. When such knowledge is unavailable, misleading, or improperly applied, performance may deteriorate. In response, we introduce a novel, domain-agnostic, add-on, and data-driven strategy inspired by image stacking in image denoising. Termed ``semantic stacking,'' our method estimates a denoised semantic representation that complements the conventional segmentation loss during training. This method does not depend on domain-specific assumptions, making it broadly applicable across diverse image modalities, model architectures, and augmentation techniques. Through extensive experiments, we validate the superiority of our approach in improving segmentation performance under diverse conditions.

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> | None |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, theoretical understanding of the performance of the approach that uses denatured data is lacking. To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results. These results suggest several insights for further improvement of self-supervised image denoising that uses denatured data in future directions.</p></details> |  | None |

This property is vital for multi-dimensional inverse problems, such as tensor completion, spectral imaging reconstruction, and multispectral image denoising. Existing tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) definitions rely on hand-designed or pre-given transforms, which lack flexibility for defining tensor nuclear norm (TNN). The TNN-regularized optimization problem is solved by the singular value thresholding (SVT) operator, which leverages the t-SVD framework to obtain the low-rank tensor. However, it is quite complicated to introduce SVT into deep neural networks due to the numerical instability problem in solving the derivatives of the eigenvectors. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven generative low-rank t-SVD model based on the learnable orthogonal transform, which can be naturally solved under its representation. Prompted by the linear algebra theorem of the Householder transformation, our learnable orthogonal transform is achieved by constructing an endogenously orthogonal matrix adaptable to neural networks, optimizing it as arbitrary orthogonal matrices. Additionally, we propose a low-rank solver as a generalization of SVT, which utilizes an efficient representation of generative networks to obtain low-rank structures.

While there have been striking improvements in image denoising with the emergence of advanced deep learning architectures and real-world datasets, recent denoising networks struggle to maintain performance on images with noise that has not been seen during training. One typical approach to address the challenge would be to adapt a denoising network to new noise distribution. Instead, in this work, we shift our focus to adapting the input noise itself, rather than adapting a network. Thus, we keep a pretrained network frozen, and adapt an input noise to capture the fine-grained deviations. As such, we propose a new denoising algorithm, dubbed Learning-to-Adapt-Noise (LAN), where a learnable noise offset is directly added to a given noisy image to bring a given input noise closer towards the noise distribution a denoising network is trained to handle. Consequently, the proposed framework exhibits performance improvement on images with unseen noise, displaying the potential of the proposed research direction.

We then train a two-layer neural network to learn the mapping from the noise-added image to the filtered image, achieving a balance between noise removal and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that FM2S excels in various microscope types and noise levels in terms of denoising effects and time consumption, obtaining an average PSNR improvement of around 6 dB over the original noisy image in a few seconds.

| **[Perception-based multiplicative noise removal using SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10283v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiplicative noise, also known as speckle or pepper noise, commonly affects images produced by synthetic aperture radar (SAR), lasers, or optical lenses. Unlike additive noise, which typically arises from thermal processes or external factors, multiplicative noise is inherent to the system, originating from the fluctuation in diffuse reflections. These fluctuations result in multiple copies of the same signal with varying magnitudes being combined. Consequently, despeckling, or removing multiplicative noise, necessitates different techniques compared to those used for additive noise removal. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Stochastic Differential Equations based diffusion models to address multiplicative noise. We demonstrate that multiplicative noise can be effectively modeled as a Geometric Brownian Motion process in the logarithmic domain. Utilizing the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive the corresponding reverse process for image denoising. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on two different datasets, comparing our approach to both classical signal processing techniques and contemporary CNN-based noise removal models. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on perception-based metrics such as FID and LPIPS, while maintaining competitive performance on traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures | None |

Existing methodologies typically address either sentence-image denoising or aspect-image denoising but fail to comprehensively tackle both types of noise. To address these limitations, we propose DualDe, a novel approach comprising two distinct components: the Hybrid Curriculum Denoising Module (HCD) and the Aspect-Enhance Denoising Module (AED). The HCD module enhances sentence-image denoising by incorporating a flexible curriculum learning strategy that prioritizes training on clean data. Concurrently, the AED module mitigates aspect-image noise through an aspect-guided attention mechanism that filters out noisy visual regions which unrelated to the specific aspects of interest. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness in addressing both sentence-image and aspect-image noise, as evidenced by experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PACLIC 2024</p></details> | None |

However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

Increasing the projection sampling is a better method to address the issue, but it also leads to significant noise in the reconstructed image. This paper proposed a projection domain denoising algorithm based on the features of the projection domain for this case. This algorithm utilized the similarity of projections of neighboring veiws to reduce image noise quickly and effectively.

A major issue is that these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, where small, carefully crafted perturbations to input data can cause them to fail. Surprisingly, perturbations specifically crafted for one model can easily transfer across various models, including CNNs, Transformers, unfolding models, and plug-and-play models, leading to failures in those models as well. Such high adversarial transferability is not observed in classification models. We analyze the possible underlying reasons behind the high adversarial transferability through a series of hypotheses and validation experiments. By characterizing the manifolds of Gaussian noise and adversarial perturbations using the concept of typical set and the asymptotic equipartition property, we prove that adversarial samples deviate slightly from the typical set of the original input distribution, causing the models to fail. Based on these insights, we propose a novel adversarial defense method: the Out-of-Distribution Typical Set Sampling Training strategy (TS). TS not only significantly enhances the model's robustness but also marginally improves denoising performance compared to the original model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comparative Study of Image Denoising Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05490v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent advancements in the field of information industry, critical data in the form of digital images is best understood by the human brain. Therefore, digital images play a significant part and backbone role in many areas such as image processing, vision computing, robotics, and bio-medical. Such use of digital images is practically implementable in various real-time scenarios like biological sciences, medicine, gaming technology, computer information and communication technology, data and statistical science, radiological sciences and medical imaging technology, and medical lab technology. However, when any digital image is sent electronically or captured via camera, it is likely to get corrupted or degraded by the available of degradation factors. To eradicate this problem, several image denoising algorithms have been proposed in the literature focusing on robust, low-cost and fast techniques to improve output performance. Consequently, in this research project, an earnest effort has been made to study various image denoising algorithms. A specific focus is given to the start-of-the-art techniques namely: NL-means, K-SVD, and BM3D. The standard images, natural images, texture images, synthetic images, and images from other datasets have been tested via these algorithms, and a detailed set of convincing results have been provided for efficient comparison.</p></details> |  | None |

To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel noise translation framework that performs denoising on an image with translated noise rather than directly denoising an original noisy image. Specifically, our approach translates complex, unknown real-world noise into Gaussian noise, which is spatially uncorrelated and independent of image content, through a noise translation network. The translated noisy images are then processed by an image denoising network pretrained to effectively remove Gaussian noise, enabling robust and consistent denoising performance. We also design well-motivated loss functions and architectures for the noise translation network by leveraging the mathematical properties of Gaussian noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves robustness and generalizability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across diverse benchmarks.

These IDR schemes are currently the state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, these IDR schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of computation, due to the need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint operators. In this work, we explore and propose a universal dimensionality reduction framework for accelerating IDR schemes in solving imaging inverse problems, based on leveraging the sketching techniques from stochastic optimization. Using this framework, we derive a number of accelerated IDR schemes, such as the plug-and-play multi-stage sketched gradient (PnP-MS2G) and sketching-based primal-dual (LSPD and Sk-LSPD) deep unrolling networks. Meanwhile, for fully accelerating PnP schemes when the denoisers are computationally expensive, we provide novel stochastic lazy denoising schemes (Lazy-PnP and Lazy-PnP-EQ), leveraging the ProxSkip scheme in optimization and equivariant image denoisers, which can massively accelerate the PnP algorithms with improved practicality. We provide theoretical analysis for recovery guarantees of instances of the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments on natural image processing and tomographic image reconstruction demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our sketched IDR schemes.</p></details> |  | None |

One such application is in the field of CT image denoising, whereby deep learning methods are proposed to recover denoised images from noisy images acquired at low radiation. Outputs derived from applying deep learning denoising algorithms may appear clean and visually pleasing; however, the underlying diagnostic image quality may not be on par with their normal-dose CT counterparts. In this work, we assessed the image quality of deep learning denoising algorithms by making use of visual perception- and data fidelity-based task-agnostic metrics (like the PSNR and the SSIM) - commonly used in the computer vision - and a task-based detectability assessment (the LCD) - extensively used in the CT imaging. When compared against normal-dose CT images, the deep learning denoisers outperformed low-dose CT based on metrics like the PSNR (by 2.4 to 3.8 dB) and SSIM (by 0.05 to 0.11). However, based on the LCD performance, the detectability using quarter-dose denoised outputs was inferior to that obtained using normal-dose CT scans.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 2024 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS), Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) and Room Temperature Semiconductor Detector Conference (RTSD)</p></details> | None |

| **[Self-Supervised Denoiser Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19593v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing images using Computed Tomography (CT) in an industrial context leads to specific challenges that differ from those encountered in other areas, such as clinical CT. Indeed, non-destructive testing with industrial CT will often involve scanning multiple similar objects while maintaining high throughput, requiring short scanning times, which is not a relevant concern in clinical CT. Under-sampling the tomographic data (sinograms) is a natural way to reduce the scanning time at the cost of image quality since the latter depends on the number of measurements. In such a scenario, post-processing techniques are required to compensate for the image artifacts induced by the sinogram sparsity. We introduce the Self-supervised Denoiser Framework (SDF), a self-supervised training method that leverages pre-training on highly sampled sinogram data to enhance the quality of images reconstructed from undersampled sinogram data. The main contribution of SDF is that it proposes to train an image denoiser in the sinogram space by setting the learning task as the prediction of one sinogram subset from another. As such, it does not require ground-truth image data, leverages the abundant data modality in CT, the sinogram, and can drastically enhance the quality of images reconstructed from a fraction of the measurements. We demonstrate that SDF produces better image quality, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, than other analytical and self-supervised frameworks in both 2D fan-beam or 3D cone-beam CT settings. Moreover, we show that the enhancement provided by SDF carries over when fine-tuning the image denoiser on a few examples, making it a suitable pre-training technique in a context where there is little high-quality image data. Our results are established on experimental datasets, making SDF a strong candidate for being the building block of foundational image-enhancement models in CT.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many denoising methods that improve the clarity of the image, inadvertently alter critical information of the denoised images, potentially compromising classification performance and diagnostic quality. Additionally, supervised denoising methods are not very practical in medical image domain, since a \emph{ground truth} denoised version of a noisy medical image is often extremely challenging to obtain. In this paper, we tackle both of these problems by introducing a novel neural network based method -- \emph{Contextual Checkerboard Denoising}, that can learn denoising from only a dataset of noisy images, while preserving crucial anatomical details necessary for image classification/analysis. We perform our experimentation on real Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images, and empirically demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves image quality, providing clearer and more detailed OCT images, while enhancing diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in Springer Journal of Medical Systems.

Conventional methods employ style loss, derived from second-order statistics or contrastive learning, to constrain style representation in the stylized result. However, these pre-defined style representations often limit stylistic expression, leading to artifacts. In contrast to existing approaches, we have discovered that latent features in vanilla diffusion models inherently contain natural style and content distributions. This allows for direct extraction of style information and seamless integration of generative priors into the content image without necessitating retraining. Our method adopts dual denoising paths to represent content and style references in latent space, subsequently guiding the content image denoising process with style latent codes. We introduce a Cross-attention Reweighting module that utilizes local content features to query style image information best suited to the input patch, thereby aligning the style distribution of the stylized results with that of the style image. Furthermore, we design a scaled adaptive instance normalization to mitigate inconsistencies in color distribution between style and stylized images on a global scale. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our diffusion-based \uline{z}ero-shot \uline{s}tyle \uline{t}ransfer via \uline{a}djusting style dist\uline{r}ibution, termed Z-STAR+.</p></details> | technical report | None |

Existing methods rely mostly on random sampling or grid sampling from the parameter space. Further, with all the current methods, it is not possible to supply any input specific parameters to the black-box. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we are able to learn input-specific parameters for a black box in this work. As a test application, we choose a popular image denoising method BM3D as our black-box compute. Then, we use a differentiable surrogate model (a neural network) to approximate the black-box behaviour. Next, another neural network is used in an end-to-end fashion to learn input instance-specific parameters for the black-box. Motivated by prior advances in surrogate-based optimization, we applied our method to the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) and the Color Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (CBSD68) for image denoising. The results are compelling, demonstrating a significant increase in PSNR and a notable improvement in SSIM nearing 0.93. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in achieving substantial improvements in both model performance and optimization efficiency.

However, it faces challenges in denoising due to ultra-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and scarce data availability. In this work, we propose Noise2SR, a zero-shot self-supervised learning (ZS-SSL) denoising framework for HREM. Within our framework, we propose a super-resolution (SR) based self-supervised training strategy, incorporating the Random Sub-sampler module. The Random Sub-sampler is designed to generate approximate infinite noisy pairs from a single noisy image, serving as an effective data augmentation in zero-shot denoising. Noise2SR trains the network with paired noisy images of different resolutions, which is conducted via SR strategy. The SR-based training facilitates the network adopting more pixels for supervision, and the random sub-sampling helps compel the network to learn continuous signals enhancing the robustness. Meanwhile, we mitigate the uncertainty caused by random-sampling by adopting minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation for the denoised results. With the distinctive integration of training strategy and proposed designs, Noise2SR can achieve superior denoising performance using a single noisy HREM image. We evaluate the performance of Noise2SR in both simulated and real HREM denoising tasks. It outperforms state-of-the-art ZS-SSL methods and achieves comparable denoising performance with supervised methods. The success of Noise2SR suggests its potential for improving the SNR of images in material imaging domains.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures | None |

Current methods either struggle with perceptual quality or suffer from significant distortion. Recently, the emerging diffusion model has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks and demonstrates great potential for image denoising. However, stimulating diffusion models for image denoising is not straightforward and requires solving several critical problems. For one thing, the input inconsistency hinders the connection between diffusion models and image denoising. For another, the content inconsistency between the generated image and the desired denoised image introduces distortion. To tackle these problems, we present a novel strategy called the Diffusion Model for Image Denoising (DMID) by understanding and rethinking the diffusion model from a denoising perspective. Our DMID strategy includes an adaptive embedding method that embeds the noisy image into a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and an adaptive ensembling method that reduces distortion in the denoised image. Our DMID strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on both distortion-based and perception-based metrics, for both Gaussian and real-world image denoising.The code is available at https://github.com/Li-Tong-621/DMID.</p></details> | 18 pages,15 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/Li-Tong-621/DMID) |

Based on this observation, we propose a novel zero-shot denoising paradigm, i.e., Masked Pre-train then Iterative fill (MPI). MPI first trains model via masking and then employs pre-trained weight for high-quality zero-shot image denoising on a single noisy image. Concretely, MPI comprises two key procedures: 1) Masked Pre-training involves training model to reconstruct massive natural images with random masking for generalizable representations, gathering the potential for valid zero-shot denoising on images with varying noise degradation and even in distinct image types. 2) Iterative filling exploits pre-trained knowledge for effective zero-shot denoising. It iteratively optimizes the image by leveraging pre-trained weights, focusing on alternate reconstruction of different image parts, and gradually assembles fully denoised image within limited number of iterations. Comprehensive experiments across various noisy scenarios underscore the notable advances of MPI over previous approaches with a marked reduction in inference time.

However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction.

While traditional Machine Learning (TML) approaches have demonstrated effectiveness, they often encounter substantial obstacles in real-world applications, including the variability of optimal feature sets, subjectivity in human-driven design, inherent biases, and methodological limitations. Specifically, TML suffers from the curse of dimensionality, difficulties in feature selection and extraction, insufficient consideration of spatial information, limited robustness against noise, scalability issues, and inadequate adaptability to complex data distributions. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as robust solutions to address these challenges. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of current trends and future prospects in HSC, emphasizing advancements from DL models to the increasing adoption of Transformer and Mamba Model architectures. We systematically review key concepts, methodologies, and state-of-the-art approaches in DL for HSC. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of Transformer-based models and the Mamba Model in HSC, detailing their advantages and challenges. Emerging trends in HSC are explored, including in-depth discussions on Explainable AI and Interoperability concepts, alongside Diffusion Models for image denoising, feature extraction, and image fusion. Comprehensive experimental results were conducted on three HS datasets to substantiate the efficacy of various conventional DL models and Transformers. Additionally, we identify several open challenges and pertinent research questions in the field of HSC.

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 3 tables | None |
| **[Dynamic Thresholding Algorithm with Memory for Linear Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08284v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The relaxed optimal $k$-thresholding pursuit (ROTP) is a recent algorithm for linear inverse problems. This algorithm is based on the optimal $k$-thresholding technique which performs vector thresholding and error metric reduction simultaneously. Although ROTP can be used to solve small to medium-sized linear inverse problems, the computational cost of this algorithm is high when solving large-scale problems. By merging the optimal $k$-thresholding technique and iterative method with memory as well as optimization with sparse search directions, we propose the so-called dynamic thresholding algorithm with memory (DTAM), which iteratively and dynamically selects vector bases to construct the problem solution. At every step, the algorithm uses more than one or all iterates generated so far to construct a new search direction, and solves only the small-sized quadratic subproblems at every iteration. Thus the computational complexity of DTAM is remarkably lower than that of ROTP-type methods. It turns out that DTAM can locate the solution of linear inverse problems if the matrix involved satisfies the restricted isometry property. Experiments on synthetic data, audio signal reconstruction and image denoising demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs comparably to several mainstream thresholding and greedy algorithms, and it works much faster than the ROTP-type algorithms especially when the sparsity level of signal is relatively low.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Denoising Method to Improve The Resolution of Satellite Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10476v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellites are widely used to estimate and monitor ground cover, providing critical information to address the challenges posed by climate change. High-resolution satellite images help to identify smaller features on the ground and classification of ground cover types. Small satellites have become very popular recently due to their cost-effectiveness. However, smaller satellites have weaker spatial resolution, and preprocessing using recent generative models made it possible to enhance the resolution of these satellite images. The objective of this paper is to propose computationally efficient guided or image-conditioned denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to perform super-resolution on low-quality images. Denoising based on stochastic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) typically takes hundreds of iterations and it can be reduced using deterministic ODEs. I propose Consistency Models (CM) that utilize deterministic ODEs for efficient denoising and perform super resolution on satellite images. The DOTA v2.0 image dataset that is used to develop object detectors needed for urban planning and ground cover estimation, is used in this project. The Stable Diffusion model is used as the base model, and the DDM in Stable Diffusion is converted into a Consistency Model (CM) using Teacher-Student Distillation to apply deterministic denoising. Stable diffusion with modified CM has successfully improved the resolution of satellite images by a factor of 16, and the computational time was reduced by a factor of 20 compared to stochastic denoising methods. The FID score of low-resolution images improved from 10.0 to 1.9 after increasing the image resolution using my algorithm for consistency models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Whole-Body PET Image Denoising Using 3D Diffusion Models with ControlNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05302v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital imaging modality widely used in clinical diagnosis and preclinical research but faces limitations in image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio due to inherent physical degradation factors. Current deep learning-based denoising methods face challenges in adapting to the variability of clinical settings, influenced by factors such as scanner types, tracer choices, dose levels, and acquisition times. In this work, we proposed a novel 3D ControlNet-based denoising method for whole-body PET imaging. We first pre-trained a 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) using a large dataset of high-quality normal-dose PET images. Following this, we fine-tuned the model on a smaller set of paired low- and normal-dose PET images, integrating low-dose inputs through a 3D ControlNet architecture, thereby making the model adaptable to denoising tasks in diverse clinical settings. Experimental results based on clinical PET datasets show that the proposed framework outperformed other state-of-the-art PET image denoising methods both in visual quality and quantitative metrics. This plug-and-play approach allows large diffusion models to be fine-tuned and adapted to PET images from diverse acquisition protocols.</p></details> |  | None |

This method works on static images, needs no registration, no camera motion and no model for the non uniformity. The proposed method uses an hybrid scheme including an automatic locally-adaptive contrast adjustment and a state-of-the-art image denoising method. It permits to correct for a fully non-linear NU and the noise efficiently using only one image. We compared it with total variation on real raw and simulated NU infrared images. The strength of this approach lies in its simplicity, low computational cost. It needs no test-pattern or calibration and produces no "ghost-artefact".</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DualDn: Dual-domain Denoising via Differentiable ISP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18783v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image denoising is a critical component in a camera's Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. There are two typical ways to inject a denoiser into the ISP pipeline: applying a denoiser directly to captured raw frames (raw domain) or to the ISP's output sRGB images (sRGB domain). However, both approaches have their limitations. Residual noise from raw-domain denoising can be amplified by the subsequent ISP processing, and the sRGB domain struggles to handle spatially varying noise since it only sees noise distorted by the ISP. Consequently, most raw or sRGB domain denoising works only for specific noise distributions and ISP configurations. To address these challenges, we propose DualDn, a novel learning-based dual-domain denoising. Unlike previous single-domain denoising, DualDn consists of two denoising networks: one in the raw domain and one in the sRGB domain. The raw domain denoising adapts to sensor-specific noise as well as spatially varying noise levels, while the sRGB domain denoising adapts to ISP variations and removes residual noise amplified by the ISP. Both denoising networks are connected with a differentiable ISP, which is trained end-to-end and discarded during the inference stage. With this design, DualDn achieves greater generalizability compared to most learning-based denoising methods, as it can adapt to different unseen noises, ISP parameters, and even novel ISP pipelines. Experiments show that DualDn achieves state-of-the-art performance and can adapt to different denoising architectures. Moreover, DualDn can be used as a plug-and-play denoising module with real cameras without retraining, and still demonstrate better performance than commercial on-camera denoising.

| **[Adaptive Domain Learning for Cross-domain Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01472v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different camera sensors have different noise patterns, and thus an image denoising model trained on one sensor often does not generalize well to a different sensor. One plausible solution is to collect a large dataset for each sensor for training or fine-tuning, which is inevitably time-consuming. To address this cross-domain challenge, we present a novel adaptive domain learning (ADL) scheme for cross-domain RAW image denoising by utilizing existing data from different sensors (source domain) plus a small amount of data from the new sensor (target domain). The ADL training scheme automatically removes the data in the source domain that are harmful to fine-tuning a model for the target domain (some data are harmful as adding them during training lowers the performance due to domain gaps). Also, we introduce a modulation module to adopt sensor-specific information (sensor type and ISO) to understand input data for image denoising. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets with various smartphone and DSLR cameras, which show our proposed model outperforms prior work on cross-domain image denoising, given a small amount of image data from the target domain sensor.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, accepted by neurips 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Invisible Image Watermarks Are Provably Removable Using Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01953v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invisible watermarks safeguard images' copyrights by embedding hidden messages only detectable by owners. They also prevent people from misusing images, especially those generated by AI models. We propose a family of regeneration attacks to remove these invisible watermarks. The proposed attack method first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and then reconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated with many existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models such as diffusion models. Through formal proofs and extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that pixel-level invisible watermarks are vulnerable to this regeneration attack. Our results reveal that, across four different pixel-level watermarking schemes, the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing attack techniques, with lower detection rates and higher image quality. However, watermarks that keep the image semantically similar can be an alternative defense against our attacks. Our finding underscores the need for a shift in research/industry emphasis from invisible watermarks to semantic-preserving watermarks.

| **[NM-FlowGAN: Modeling sRGB Noise without Paired Images using a Hybrid Approach of Normalizing Flows and GAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10112v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and synthesizing real sRGB noise is crucial for various low-level vision tasks, such as building datasets for training image denoising systems. The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We combine pixel-wise noise modeling networks based on Normalizing Flows and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. Specifically, the pixel-wise noise modeling network leverages the high training stability of Normalizing Flows to capture noise characteristics that are affected by a multitude of factors, and the spatial correlation networks efficiently model pixel-to-pixel relationships. In particular, unlike recent methods that rely on paired noisy images, our method synthesizes noise using clean images and factors that affect noise characteristics, such as easily obtainable parameters like camera type and ISO settings, making it applicable to various fields where obtaining noisy-clean image pairs is not feasible. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines in the sRGB noise synthesis task. Moreover, the denoising neural network trained with synthesized image pairs from our model shows superior performance compared to other baselines.

While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[Temporal and Spatial Super Resolution with Latent Diffusion Model in Medical MRI images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23898v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super Resolution (SR) plays a critical role in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging, where hardware and acquisition time constraints often result in low spatial and temporal resolution. While diffusion models have been applied for both spatial and temporal SR, few studies have explored their use for joint spatial and temporal SR, particularly in medical imaging. In this work, we address this gap by proposing to use a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) combined with a Vector Quantised GAN (VQGAN)-based encoder-decoder architecture for joint super resolution. We frame SR as an image denoising problem, focusing on improving both spatial and temporal resolution in medical images. Using the cardiac MRI dataset from the Data Science Bowl Cardiac Challenge, consisting of 2D cine images with a spatial resolution of 256x256 and 8-14 slices per time-step, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our LDM model achieves Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.37, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.7580, and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.2756, outperforming simple baseline method by 5% in PSNR, 6.5% in SSIM, 39% in LPIPS. Our LDM model generates images with high fidelity and perceptual quality with 15 diffusion steps. These results suggest that LDMs hold promise for advancing super resolution in medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

| **[DRACO: A Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for Cryo-EM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11373v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in computer vision have demonstrated exceptional performance in zero-shot and few-shot tasks by extracting multi-purpose features from large-scale datasets through self-supervised pre-training methods. However, these models often overlook the severe corruption in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images by high-level noises. We introduce DRACO, a Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for CryO-EM, inspired by the Noise2Noise (N2N) approach. By processing cryo-EM movies into odd and even images and treating them as independent noisy observations, we apply a denoising-reconstruction hybrid training scheme. We mask both images to create denoising and reconstruction tasks. For DRACO's pre-training, the quality of the dataset is essential, we hence build a high-quality, diverse dataset from an uncurated public database, including over 270,000 movies or micrographs. After pre-training, DRACO naturally serves as a generalizable cryo-EM image denoiser and a foundation model for various cryo-EM downstream tasks. DRACO demonstrates the best performance in denoising, micrograph curation, and particle picking tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
