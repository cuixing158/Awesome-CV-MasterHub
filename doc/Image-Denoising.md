| **[Self-supervised conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification in Poisson imaging problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19194v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration problems are often ill-posed, leading to significant uncertainty in reconstructed images. Accurately quantifying this uncertainty is essential for the reliable interpretation of reconstructed images. However, image restoration methods often lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. Conformal prediction offers a rigorous framework to augment image restoration methods with accurate uncertainty quantification estimates, but it typically requires abundant ground truth data for calibration. This paper presents a self-supervised conformal prediction method for Poisson imaging problems which leverages Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator to eliminate the need for ground truth data. The resulting self-calibrating conformal prediction approach is applicable to any Poisson linear imaging problem that is ill-conditioned, and is particularly effective when combined with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques trained directly on measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring; its performance are comparable to supervised conformal prediction methods relying on ground truth data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CCDM: Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03546v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Conditional Generative Modeling (CCGM) estimates high-dimensional data distributions, such as images, conditioned on scalar continuous variables (aka regression labels). While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/UBCDingXin/CCDM) |
| **[PFCM: Poisson flow consistency models for low-dose CT image denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08159v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used for medical diagnosis and treatment planning; however, concerns about ionizing radiation exposure drive efforts to optimize image quality at lower doses. This study introduces Poisson Flow Consistency Models (PFCM), a novel family of deep generative models that combines the robustness of PFGM++ with the efficient single-step sampling of consistency models. PFCM are derived by generalizing consistency distillation to PFGM++ through a change-of-variables and an updated noise distribution. As a distilled version of PFGM++, PFCM inherit the ability to trade off robustness for rigidity via the hyperparameter $D \in (0,\infty)$. A fact that we exploit to adapt this novel generative model for the task of low-dose CT image denoising, via a ``task-specific'' sampler that ``hijacks'' the generative process by replacing an intermediate state with the low-dose CT image. While this ``hijacking'' introduces a severe mismatch -- the noise characteristics of low-dose CT images are different from that of intermediate states in the Poisson flow process -- we show that the inherent robustness of PFCM at small $D$ effectively mitigates this issue. The resulting sampler achieves excellent performance in terms of LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR on the Mayo low-dose CT dataset. By contrast, an analogous sampler based on standard consistency models is found to be significantly less robust under the same conditions, highlighting the importance of a tunable $D$ afforded by our novel framework. To highlight generalizability, we show effective denoising of clinical images from a prototype photon-counting system reconstructed using a sharper kernel and at a range of energy levels.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Noise2Score3D:Unsupervised Tweedie's Approach for Point Cloud Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16826v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on recent advances in Bayesian statistics and image denoising, we propose Noise2Score3D, a fully unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising that addresses the critical challenge of limited availability of clean data. Noise2Score3D learns the gradient of the underlying point cloud distribution directly from noisy data, eliminating the need for clean data during training. By leveraging Tweedie's formula, our method performs inference in a single step, avoiding the iterative processes used in existing unsupervised methods, thereby improving both performance and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Noise2Score3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, outperforming other unsupervised methods in Chamfer distance and point-to-mesh metrics, and rivaling some supervised approaches. Furthermore, Noise2Score3D demonstrates strong generalization ability beyond training datasets. Additionally, we introduce Total Variation for Point Cloud, a criterion that allows for the estimation of unknown noise parameters, which further enhances the method's versatility and real-world utility.</p></details> |  | None |
