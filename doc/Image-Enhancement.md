| **[IRSRMamba: Infrared Image Super-Resolution via Mamba-based Wavelet Transform Feature Modulation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09873v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared image super-resolution demands long-range dependency modeling and multi-scale feature extraction to address challenges such as homogeneous backgrounds, weak edges, and sparse textures. While Mamba-based state-space models (SSMs) excel in global dependency modeling with linear complexity, their block-wise processing disrupts spatial consistency, limiting their effectiveness for IR image reconstruction. We propose IRSRMamba, a novel framework integrating wavelet transform feature modulation for multi-scale adaptation and an SSMs-based semantic consistency loss to restore fragmented contextual information. This design enhances global-local feature fusion, structural coherence, and fine-detail preservation while mitigating block-induced artifacts. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that IRSRMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality. This work establishes Mamba-based architectures as a promising direction for high-fidelity IR image enhancement.

| **[Zero-Reference Lighting Estimation Diffusion Model for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02879v3)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion model-based low-light image enhancement methods rely heavily on paired training data, leading to limited extensive application. Meanwhile, existing unsupervised methods lack effective bridging capabilities for unknown degradation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-reference lighting estimation diffusion model for low-light image enhancement called Zero-LED. It utilizes the stable convergence ability of diffusion models to bridge the gap between low-light domains and real normal-light domains and successfully alleviates the dependence on pairwise training data via zero-reference learning. Specifically, we first design the initial optimization network to preprocess the input image and implement bidirectional constraints between the diffusion model and the initial optimization network through multiple objective functions. Subsequently, the degradation factors of the real-world scene are optimized iteratively to achieve effective light enhancement. In addition, we explore a frequency-domain based and semantically guided appearance reconstruction module that encourages feature alignment of the recovered image at a fine-grained level and satisfies subjective expectations. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach to other state-of-the-art methods and more significant generalization capabilities. We will open the source code upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VIIS: Visible and Infrared Information Synthesis for Severe Low-light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13655v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images captured in severe low-light circumstances often suffer from significant information absence. Existing singular modality image enhancement methods struggle to restore image regions lacking valid information. By leveraging light-impervious infrared images, visible and infrared image fusion methods have the potential to reveal information hidden in darkness. However, they primarily emphasize inter-modal complementation but neglect intra-modal enhancement, limiting the perceptual quality of output images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, dubbed visible and infrared information synthesis (VIIS), which aims to achieve both information enhancement and fusion of the two modalities. Given the difficulty in obtaining ground truth in the VIIS task, we design an information synthesis pretext task (ISPT) based on image augmentation. We employ a diffusion model as the framework and design a sparse attention-based dual-modalities residual (SADMR) conditioning mechanism to enhance information interaction between the two modalities. This mechanism enables features with prior knowledge from both modalities to adaptively and iteratively attend to each modality's information during the denoising process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms not only the state-of-the-art methods in relevant fields but also the newly designed baselines capable of both information enhancement and fusion.

| **[Multi-Task-oriented Nighttime Haze Imaging Enhancer for Vision-driven Measurement Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07351v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in vision-driven measurement systems (VMS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality, and complicating the SOD process. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MToIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MToIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MToIE surpasses existing methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of vision systems across diverse imaging scenarios.

| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Image Signal Processing Approaches for Low-Illumination Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05995v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The usage of digital content (photos and videos) in a variety of applications has increased due to the popularity of multimedia devices. These uses include advertising campaigns, educational resources, and social networking platforms. There is an increasing need for high-quality graphic information as people become more visually focused. However, captured images frequently have poor visibility and a high amount of noise due to the limitations of image-capturing devices and lighting conditions. Improving the visual quality of images taken in low illumination is the aim of low-illumination image enhancement. This problem is addressed by traditional image enhancement techniques, which alter noise, brightness, and contrast. Deep learning-based methods, however, have dominated recently made advances in this area. These methods have effectively reduced noise while preserving important information, showing promising results in the improvement of low-illumination images. An extensive summary of image signal processing methods for enhancing low-illumination images is provided in this paper. Three categories are classified in the review for approaches: hybrid techniques, deep learning-based methods, and traditional approaches. Conventional techniques include denoising, automated white balancing, and noise reduction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in deep learningbased techniques to recognize and extract characteristics from low-light images. To get better results, hybrid approaches combine deep learning-based methodologies with more conventional methods. The review also discusses the advantages and limitations of each approach and provides insights into future research directions in this field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Defeasible Visual Entailment: Benchmark, Evaluator, and Reward-Driven Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16232v3)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new task called Defeasible Visual Entailment (DVE), where the goal is to allow the modification of the entailment relationship between an image premise and a text hypothesis based on an additional update. While this concept is well-established in Natural Language Inference, it remains unexplored in visual entailment. At a high level, DVE enables models to refine their initial interpretations, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in various applications such as detecting misleading information in images, enhancing visual question answering, and refining decision-making processes in autonomous systems. Existing metrics do not adequately capture the change in the entailment relationship brought by updates. To address this, we propose a novel inference-aware evaluator designed to capture changes in entailment strength induced by updates, using pairwise contrastive learning and categorical information learning. Additionally, we introduce a reward-driven update optimization method to further enhance the quality of updates generated by multimodal models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluator and optimization method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Performance Evaluation of Image Enhancement Techniques on Transfer Learning for Touchless Fingerprint Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04680v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fingerprint recognition remains one of the most reliable biometric technologies due to its high accuracy and uniqueness. Traditional systems rely on contact-based scanners, which are prone to issues such as image degradation from surface contamination and inconsistent user interaction. To address these limitations, contactless fingerprint recognition has emerged as a promising alternative, providing non-intrusive and hygienic authentication. This study evaluates the impact of image enhancement tech-niques on the performance of pre-trained deep learning models using transfer learning for touchless fingerprint recognition. The IIT-Bombay Touchless and Touch-Based Fingerprint Database, containing data from 200 subjects, was employed to test the per-formance of deep learning architectures such as VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50. Experimental results reveal that transfer learning methods with fingerprint image enhance-ment (indirect method) significantly outperform those without enhancement (direct method). Specifically, VGG-16 achieved an accuracy of 98% in training and 93% in testing when using the enhanced images, demonstrating superior performance compared to the direct method. This paper provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of image enhancement in improving the accuracy of transfer learning models for touchless fingerprint recognition, offering key insights for developing more efficient biometric systems.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |
| **[KAN See In the Dark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03404v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing low-light image enhancement methods are difficult to fit the complex nonlinear relationship between normal and low-light images due to uneven illumination and noise effects. The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) feature spline-based convolutional layers and learnable activation functions, which can effectively capture nonlinear dependencies. In this paper, we design a KAN-Block based on KANs and innovatively apply it to low-light image enhancement. This method effectively alleviates the limitations of current methods constrained by linear network structures and lack of interpretability, further demonstrating the potential of KANs in low-level vision tasks. Given the poor perception of current low-light image enhancement methods and the stochastic nature of the inverse diffusion process, we further introduce frequency-domain perception for visually oriented enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our method on benchmark datasets.
