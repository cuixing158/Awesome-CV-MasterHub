| **[$\textrm{A}^{\textrm{2}}$RNet: Adversarial Attack Resilient Network for Robust Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09954v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a crucial technique for enhancing visual performance by integrating unique information from different modalities into one fused image. Exiting methods pay more attention to conducting fusion with undisturbed data, while overlooking the impact of deliberate interference on the effectiveness of fusion results. To investigate the robustness of fusion models, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial attack resilient network, called $\textrm{A}^{\textrm{2}}$RNet. Specifically, we develop an adversarial paradigm with an anti-attack loss function to implement adversarial attacks and training. It is constructed based on the intrinsic nature of IVIF and provide a robust foundation for future research advancements. We adopt a Unet as the pipeline with a transformer-based defensive refinement module (DRM) under this paradigm, which guarantees fused image quality in a robust coarse-to-fine manner. Compared to previous works, our method mitigates the adverse effects of adversarial perturbations, consistently maintaining high-fidelity fusion results. Furthermore, the performance of downstream tasks can also be well maintained under adversarial attacks.

| **[VIIS: Visible and Infrared Information Synthesis for Severe Low-light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13655v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images captured in severe low-light circumstances often suffer from significant information absence. Existing singular modality image enhancement methods struggle to restore image regions lacking valid information. By leveraging light-impervious infrared images, visible and infrared image fusion methods have the potential to reveal information hidden in darkness. However, they primarily emphasize inter-modal complementation but neglect intra-modal enhancement, limiting the perceptual quality of output images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, dubbed visible and infrared information synthesis (VIIS), which aims to achieve both information enhancement and fusion of the two modalities. Given the difficulty in obtaining ground truth in the VIIS task, we design an information synthesis pretext task (ISPT) based on image augmentation. We employ a diffusion model as the framework and design a sparse attention-based dual-modalities residual (SADMR) conditioning mechanism to enhance information interaction between the two modalities. This mechanism enables features with prior knowledge from both modalities to adaptively and iteratively attend to each modality's information during the denoising process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms not only the state-of-the-art methods in relevant fields but also the newly designed baselines capable of both information enhancement and fusion.

| **[MaeFuse: Transferring Omni Features with Pretrained Masked Autoencoders for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion via Guided Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11016v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce MaeFuse, a novel autoencoder model designed for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF). The existing approaches for image fusion often rely on training combined with downstream tasks to obtain highlevel visual information, which is effective in emphasizing target objects and delivering impressive results in visual quality and task-specific applications. Instead of being driven by downstream tasks, our model called MaeFuse utilizes a pretrained encoder from Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which facilities the omni features extraction for low-level reconstruction and high-level vision tasks, to obtain perception friendly features with a low cost. In order to eliminate the domain gap of different modal features and the block effect caused by the MAE encoder, we further develop a guided training strategy. This strategy is meticulously crafted to ensure that the fusion layer seamlessly adjusts to the feature space of the encoder, gradually enhancing the fusion performance. The proposed method can facilitate the comprehensive integration of feature vectors from both infrared and visible modalities, thus preserving the rich details inherent in each modal. MaeFuse not only introduces a novel perspective in the realm of fusion techniques but also stands out with impressive performance across various public datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Infrared-Assisted Single-Stage Framework for Joint Restoration and Fusion of Visible and Infrared Images under Hazy Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12586v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible (IR-VIS) image fusion has gained significant attention for its broad application value. However, existing methods often neglect the complementary role of infrared image in restoring visible image features under hazy conditions. To address this, we propose a joint learning framework that utilizes infrared image for the restoration and fusion of hazy IR-VIS images. To mitigate the adverse effects of feature diversity between IR-VIS images, we introduce a prompt generation mechanism that regulates modality-specific feature incompatibility. This creates a prompt selection matrix from non-shared image information, followed by prompt embeddings generated from a prompt pool. These embeddings help generate candidate features for dehazing. We further design an infrared-assisted feature restoration mechanism that selects candidate features based on haze density, enabling simultaneous restoration and fusion within a single-stage framework. To enhance fusion quality, we construct a multi-stage prompt embedding fusion module that leverages feature supplementation from the prompt generation module. Our method effectively fuses IR-VIS images while removing haze, yielding clear, haze-free fusion results. In contrast to two-stage methods that dehaze and then fuse, our approach enables collaborative training in a single-stage framework, making the model relatively lightweight and suitable for practical deployment. Experimental results validate its effectiveness and demonstrate advantages over existing methods.

| **[HetSSNet: Spatial-Spectral Heterogeneous Graph Learning Network for Panchromatic and Multispectral Images Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04623v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. In the mainstream modeling strategies, i.e., CNN and Transformer, the input images are treated as the equal-sized grid of pixels in the Euclidean space. They have limitations in facing remote sensing images with irregular ground objects. Graph is the more flexible structure, however, there are two major challenges when modeling spatial-spectral properties with graph: \emph{1) constructing the customized graph structure for spatial-spectral relationship priors}; \emph{2) learning the unified spatial-spectral representation through the graph}. To address these challenges, we propose the spatial-spectral heterogeneous graph learning network, named \textbf{HetSSNet}. Specifically, HetSSNet initially constructs the heterogeneous graph structure for pansharpening, which explicitly describes pansharpening-specific relationships. Subsequently, the basic relationship pattern generation module is designed to extract the multiple relationship patterns from the heterogeneous graph. Finally, relationship pattern aggregation module is exploited to collaboratively learn unified spatial-spectral representation across different relationships among nodes with adaptive importance learning from local and global perspectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority and generalization of HetSSNet.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MATCNN: Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Method Based on Multi-scale CNN with Attention Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01959v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While attention-based approaches have shown considerable progress in enhancing image fusion and addressing the challenges posed by long-range feature dependencies, their efficacy in capturing local features is compromised by the lack of diverse receptive field extraction techniques. To overcome the shortcomings of existing fusion methods in extracting multi-scale local features and preserving global features, this paper proposes a novel cross-modal image fusion approach based on a multi-scale convolutional neural network with attention Transformer (MATCNN). MATCNN utilizes the multi-scale fusion module (MSFM) to extract local features at different scales and employs the global feature extraction module (GFEM) to extract global features. Combining the two reduces the loss of detail features and improves the ability of global feature representation. Simultaneously, an information mask is used to label pertinent details within the images, aiming to enhance the proportion of preserving significant information in infrared images and background textures in visible images in fused images. Subsequently, a novel optimization algorithm is developed, leveraging the mask to guide feature extraction through the integration of content, structural similarity index measurement, and global feature loss. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted across various datasets, revealing that MATCNN effectively highlights infrared salient targets, preserves additional details in visible images, and achieves better fusion results for cross-modal images. The code of MATCNN will be available at https://github.com/zhang3849/MATCNN.git.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhang3849/MATCNN.git) |
| **[ReFusion: Learning Image Fusion from Reconstruction with Learnable Loss via Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07943v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion aims to combine information from multiple source images into a single one with more comprehensive informational content. Deep learning-based image fusion algorithms face significant challenges, including the lack of a definitive ground truth and the corresponding distance measurement. Additionally, current manually defined loss functions limit the model's flexibility and generalizability for various fusion tasks. To address these limitations, we propose ReFusion, a unified meta-learning based image fusion framework that dynamically optimizes the fusion loss for various tasks through source image reconstruction. Compared to existing methods, ReFusion employs a parameterized loss function, that allows the training framework to be dynamically adapted according to the specific fusion scenario and task. ReFusion consists of three key components: a fusion module, a source reconstruction module, and a loss proposal module. We employ a meta-learning strategy to train the loss proposal module using the reconstruction loss. This strategy forces the fused image to be more conducive to reconstruct source images, allowing the loss proposal module to generate a adaptive fusion loss that preserves the optimal information from the source images. The update of the fusion module relies on the learnable fusion loss proposed by the loss proposal module. The three modules update alternately, enhancing each other to optimize the fusion loss for different tasks and consistently achieve satisfactory results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFusion is capable of adapting to various tasks, including infrared-visible, medical, multi-focus, and multi-exposure image fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is published in International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Deep Unfolding Multi-modal Image Fusion Network via Attribution Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01467v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal image fusion synthesizes information from multiple sources into a single image, facilitating downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation. Current approaches primarily focus on acquiring informative fusion images at the visual display stratum through intricate mappings. Although some approaches attempt to jointly optimize image fusion and downstream tasks, these efforts often lack direct guidance or interaction, serving only to assist with a predefined fusion loss. To address this, we propose an ``Unfolding Attribution Analysis Fusion network'' (UAAFusion), using attribution analysis to tailor fused images more effectively for semantic segmentation, enhancing the interaction between the fusion and segmentation. Specifically, we utilize attribution analysis techniques to explore the contributions of semantic regions in the source images to task discrimination. At the same time, our fusion algorithm incorporates more beneficial features from the source images, thereby allowing the segmentation to guide the fusion process. Our method constructs a model-driven unfolding network that uses optimization objectives derived from attribution analysis, with an attribution fusion loss calculated from the current state of the segmentation network. We also develop a new pathway function for attribution analysis, specifically tailored to the fusion tasks in our unfolding network. An attribution attention mechanism is integrated at each network stage, allowing the fusion network to prioritize areas and pixels crucial for high-level recognition tasks. Additionally, to mitigate the information loss in traditional unfolding networks, a memory augmentation module is incorporated into our network to improve the information flow across various network layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in image fusion and applicability to semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT) 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[FusionMamba: Dynamic Feature Enhancement for Multimodal Image Fusion with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09498v3)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal image fusion aims to integrate information from different imaging techniques to produce a comprehensive, detail-rich single image for downstream vision tasks. Existing methods based on local convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle to capture global features efficiently, while Transformer-based models are computationally expensive, although they excel at global modeling. Mamba addresses these limitations by leveraging selective structured state space models (S4) to effectively handle long-range dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. In this paper, we propose FusionMamba, a novel dynamic feature enhancement framework that aims to overcome the challenges faced by CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks. The framework improves the visual state-space model Mamba by integrating dynamic convolution and channel attention mechanisms, which not only retains its powerful global feature modeling capability, but also greatly reduces redundancy and enhances the expressiveness of local features. In addition, we have developed a new module called the dynamic feature fusion module (DFFM). It combines the dynamic feature enhancement module (DFEM) for texture enhancement and disparity perception with the cross-modal fusion Mamba module (CMFM), which focuses on enhancing the inter-modal correlation while suppressing redundant information. Experiments show that FusionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of multimodal image fusion tasks as well as downstream experiments, demonstrating its broad applicability and superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Visual Intelligence.

| **[Deep Ensembling with Multimodal Image Fusion for Efficient Classification of Lung Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00078v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study focuses on the classification of cancerous and healthy slices from multimodal lung images. The data used in the research comprises Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. The proposed strategy achieves the fusion of PET and CT images by utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an Autoencoder. Subsequently, a new ensemble-based classifier developed, Deep Ensembled Multimodal Fusion (DEMF), employing majority voting to classify the sample images under examination. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) employed to visualize the classification accuracy of cancer-affected images. Given the limited sample size, a random image augmentation strategy employed during the training phase. The DEMF network helps mitigate the challenges of scarce data in computer-aided medical image analysis. The proposed network compared with state-of-the-art networks across three publicly available datasets. The network outperforms others based on the metrics - Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall. The investigation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed network.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Arbitrary Data as Images: Fusion of Patient Data Across Modalities and Irregular Intervals with Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18237v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A patient undergoes multiple examinations in each hospital stay, where each provides different facets of the health status. These assessments include temporal data with varying sampling rates, discrete single-point measurements, therapeutic interventions such as medication administration, and images. While physicians are able to process and integrate diverse modalities intuitively, neural networks need specific modeling for each modality complicating the training procedure. We demonstrate that this complexity can be significantly reduced by visualizing all information as images along with unstructured text and subsequently training a conventional vision-text transformer. Our approach, Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements (ViTiMM), not only simplifies data preprocessing and modeling but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping, as evaluated on 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The modalities include patient's clinical measurements, medications, X-ray images, and electrocardiography scans. We hope our work inspires advancements in multi-modal medical AI by reducing the training complexity to (visual) prompt engineering, thus lowering entry barriers and enabling no-code solutions for training. The source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

While current methods have advanced the fusion of texture details and semantic information, their complex training processes hinder broader applications. Addressing this challenge, we introduce E2E-MFD, a novel end-to-end algorithm for multimodal fusion detection. E2E-MFD streamlines the process, achieving high performance with a single training phase. It employs synchronous joint optimization across components to avoid suboptimal solutions tied to individual tasks. Furthermore, it implements a comprehensive optimization strategy in the gradient matrix for shared parameters, ensuring convergence to an optimal fusion detection configuration. Our extensive testing on multiple public datasets reveals E2E-MFD's superior capabilities, showcasing not only visually appealing image fusion but also impressive detection outcomes, such as a 3.9% and 2.0% mAP50 increase on horizontal object detection dataset M3FD and oriented object detection dataset DroneVehicle, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Rethinking Early-Fusion Strategies for Improved Multimodal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10958v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB and thermal image fusion have great potential to exhibit improved semantic segmentation in low-illumination conditions. Existing methods typically employ a two-branch encoder framework for multimodal feature extraction and design complicated feature fusion strategies to achieve feature extraction and fusion for multimodal semantic segmentation. However, these methods require massive parameter updates and computational effort during the feature extraction and fusion. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal fusion network (EFNet) based on an early fusion strategy and a simple but effective feature clustering for training efficient RGB-T semantic segmentation. In addition, we also propose a lightweight and efficient multi-scale feature aggregation decoder based on Euclidean distance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on different datasets and outperform previous state-of-the-art methods with lower parameters and computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Infrared and Visible Image Fusion: From Data Compatibility to Task Adaption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10761v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) is a critical task in computer vision, aimed at integrating the unique features of both infrared and visible spectra into a unified representation. Since 2018, the field has entered the deep learning era, with an increasing variety of approaches introducing a range of networks and loss functions to enhance visual performance. However, challenges such as data compatibility, perception accuracy, and efficiency remain. Unfortunately, there is a lack of recent comprehensive surveys that address this rapidly expanding domain. This paper fills that gap by providing a thorough survey covering a broad range of topics. We introduce a multi-dimensional framework to elucidate common learning-based IVIF methods, from visual enhancement strategies to data compatibility and task adaptability. We also present a detailed analysis of these approaches, accompanied by a lookup table clarifying their core ideas. Furthermore, we summarize performance comparisons, both quantitatively and qualitatively, focusing on registration, fusion, and subsequent high-level tasks. Beyond technical analysis, we discuss potential future directions and open issues in this area.

While existing methods leverage spatial and spectral relationships, they often suffer from limited receptive fields and insufficient feature utilization, leading to suboptimal performance. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality HSI data highlights the importance of efficient data utilization to maximize reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose HyFusion, a novel Dual-Coupled Network (DCN) framework designed to enhance cross-domain feature extraction and enable effective feature map reusing. The framework first processes HR-MSI and LR-HSI inputs through specialized subnetworks that mutually enhance each other during feature extraction, preserving complementary spatial and spectral details. At its core, HyFusion utilizes an Enhanced Reception Field Block (ERFB), which combines shifting-window attention and dense connections to expand the receptive field, effectively capturing long-range dependencies while minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion, significantly improving reconstruction quality while maintaining a compact model size and computational efficiency. By integrating enhanced receptive fields and feature map reusing into a coupled network architecture, HyFusion provides a practical and effective solution for HSI fusion in resource-constrained scenarios, setting a new benchmark in hyperspectral imaging. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IGARSS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Depth and Image Fusion for Road Obstacle Detection Using Stereo Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07245v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is devoted to the detection of objects on a road, performed with a combination of two methods based on both the use of depth information and video analysis of data from a stereo camera. Since neither the time of the appearance of an object on the road, nor its size and shape is known in advance, ML/DL-based approaches are not applicable. The task becomes more complicated due to variations in artificial illumination, inhomogeneous road surface texture, and unknown character and features of the object. To solve this problem we developed the depth and image fusion method that complements a search of small contrast objects by RGB-based method, and obstacle detection by stereo image-based approach with SLIC superpixel segmentation. We conducted experiments with static and low speed obstacles in an underground parking lot and demonstrated the successful work of the developed technique for detecting and even tracking small objects, which can be parking infrastructure objects, things left on the road, wheels, dropped boxes, etc.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Text-to-Image GAN with Pretrained Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00116v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating desired images conditioned on given text descriptions has received lots of attention. Recently, diffusion models and autoregressive models have demonstrated their outstanding expressivity and gradually replaced GAN as the favored architectures for text-to-image synthesis. However, they still face some obstacles: slow inference speed and expensive training costs. To achieve more powerful and faster text-to-image synthesis under complex scenes, we propose TIGER, a text-to-image GAN with pretrained representations. To be specific, we propose a vision-empowered discriminator and a high-capacity generator. (i) The vision-empowered discriminator absorbs the complex scene understanding ability and the domain generalization ability from pretrained vision models to enhance model performance. Unlike previous works, we explore stacking multiple pretrained models in our discriminator to collect multiple different representations. (ii) The high-capacity generator aims to achieve effective text-image fusion while increasing the model capacity. The high-capacity generator consists of multiple novel high-capacity fusion blocks (HFBlock). And the HFBlock contains several deep fusion modules and a global fusion module, which play different roles to benefit our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed TIGER both on standard and zero-shot text-to-image synthesis tasks. On the standard text-to-image synthesis task, TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, which obtain a new FID 5.48 (COCO) and 9.38 (CUB). On the zero-shot text-to-image synthesis task, we achieve comparable performance with fewer model parameters, smaller training data size and faster inference speed. Additionally, more experiments and analyses are conducted in the Supplementary Material.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-modality image fusion, particularly integrating infrared imaging, offers a robust solution by combining complementary information from different modalities to enhance scene understanding and decision-making. However, current methods face significant limitations: GAN-based approaches often produce blurry images that lack fine-grained details, while AE-based methods may introduce bias toward specific modalities, leading to unnatural fusion results. To address these challenges, we propose DAE-Fuse, a novel two-phase discriminative autoencoder framework that generates sharp and natural fused images. Furthermore, We pioneer the extension of image fusion techniques from static images to the video domain while preserving temporal consistency across frames, thus advancing the perceptual capabilities required for autonomous navigation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DAE-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with superior generalizability to tasks like medical image fusion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Complementary Advantages: Exploiting Cross-Field Frequency Correlation for NIR-Assisted Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16645v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing single-image denoising algorithms often struggle to restore details when dealing with complex noisy images. The introduction of near-infrared (NIR) images offers new possibilities for RGB image denoising. However, due to the inconsistency between NIR and RGB images, the existing works still struggle to balance the contributions of two fields in the process of image fusion. In response to this, in this paper, we develop a cross-field Frequency Correlation Exploiting Network (FCENet) for NIR-assisted image denoising. We first propose the frequency correlation prior based on an in-depth statistical frequency analysis of NIR-RGB image pairs. The prior reveals the complementary correlation of NIR and RGB images in the frequency domain. Leveraging frequency correlation prior, we then establish a frequency learning framework composed of Frequency Dynamic Selection Mechanism (FDSM) and Frequency Exhaustive Fusion Mechanism (FEFM). FDSM dynamically selects complementary information from NIR and RGB images in the frequency domain, and FEFM strengthens the control of common and differential features during the fusion of NIR and RGB features. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data validate that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of image quality and computational efficiency. The code will be released to the public.</p></details> |  | None |

Apart from that, there is a trend to design a manageable and editable algorithm as the different needs of real application scenarios. To tackle these issues, we introduce 3D LUT technology, which can enhance images with ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolution in real time on resource-constrained devices. However, since the fusion of information from multiple images with different exposure rates is uncertain, and this uncertainty significantly trials the generalization power of the 3D LUT grid. To address this issue and ensure a robust learning space for the model, we propose using a teacher-student network to model the uncertainty on the 3D LUT grid.Furthermore, we provide an editable mode for the multi-exposure image fusion algorithm by using the implicit representation function to match the requirements in different scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is highly competitive in efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Ultra-High-Definition Dynamic Multi-Exposure Image Fusion via Infinite Pixel Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11685v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent text-guided SR methods attempt to leverage textual information for enhanced detail, but they frequently struggle with effective alignment, resulting in inconsistent semantic coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce a multi-modal semantic enhancement approach that combines textual semantics with visual features, effectively tackling semantic mismatches and detail loss in highly degraded LR images. Our proposed multi-modal collaborative framework enables the production of realistic and high-quality SR images at significant up-scaling factors. The framework integrates text and image inputs, employing a prompt predictor, Text-Image Fusion Block (TIFBlock), and Iterative Refinement Module alongside CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) features to guide a progressive enhancement process with fine-grained alignment. This alignment produces high-resolution outputs with crisp details and semantic coherence, even at large scaling factors. Through extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies, we validate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, by incorporating textual semantic guidance, our technique enables a degree of super-resolution editability while maintaining semantic coherence.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[CoCoNet: Coupled Contrastive Learning Network with Multi-level Feature Ensemble for Multi-modality Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10960v3)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion targets to provide an informative image by combining complementary information from different sensors. Existing learning-based fusion approaches attempt to construct various loss functions to preserve complementary features, while neglecting to discover the inter-relationship between the two modalities, leading to redundant or even invalid information on the fusion results. Moreover, most methods focus on strengthening the network with an increase in depth while neglecting the importance of feature transmission, causing vital information degeneration. To alleviate these issues, we propose a coupled contrastive learning network, dubbed CoCoNet, to realize infrared and visible image fusion in an end-to-end manner. Concretely, to simultaneously retain typical features from both modalities and to avoid artifacts emerging on the fused result, we develop a coupled contrastive constraint in our loss function. In a fused image, its foreground target / background detail part is pulled close to the infrared / visible source and pushed far away from the visible / infrared source in the representation space. We further exploit image characteristics to provide data-sensitive weights, allowing our loss function to build a more reliable relationship with source images. A multi-level attention module is established to learn rich hierarchical feature representation and to comprehensively transfer features in the fusion process. We also apply the proposed CoCoNet on medical image fusion of different types, e.g., magnetic resonance image, positron emission tomography image, and single photon emission computed tomography image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under both subjective and objective evaluation, especially in preserving prominent targets and recovering vital textural details.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BSAFusion: A Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment Network for Unaligned Medical Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08050v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>If unaligned multimodal medical images can be simultaneously aligned and fused using a single-stage approach within a unified processing framework, it will not only achieve mutual promotion of dual tasks but also help reduce the complexity of the model. However, the design of this model faces the challenge of incompatible requirements for feature fusion and alignment; specifically, feature alignment requires consistency among corresponding features, whereas feature fusion requires the features to be complementary to each other. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an unaligned medical image fusion method called Bidirectional Stepwise Feature Alignment and Fusion (BSFA-F) strategy. To reduce the negative impact of modality differences on cross-modal feature matching, we incorporate the Modal Discrepancy-Free Feature Representation (MDF-FR) method into BSFA-F. MDF-FR utilizes a Modality Feature Representation Head (MFRH) to integrate the global information of the input image. By injecting the information contained in MFRH of the current image into other modality images, it effectively reduces the impact of modality differences on feature alignment while preserving the complementary information carried by different images. In terms of feature alignment, BSFA-F employs a bidirectional stepwise alignment deformation field prediction strategy based on the path independence of vector displacement between two points. This strategy solves the problem of large spans and inaccurate deformation field prediction in single-step alignment. Finally, Multi-Modal Feature Fusion block achieves the fusion of aligned features. The experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

As infrared images provide additional clear edge information that complements RGB images, fusing RGB and infrared images has potential to enhance the detection ability in poor-illumination environments. However, existing works involving both visible and infrared images only focus on image fusion, instead of object detection. Moreover, they directly fuse the two kinds of image modalities, which ignores the mutual interference between them. To fuse the two modalities to maximize the advantages of cross-modality, we design a dual-enhancement-based cross-modality object detection network DEYOLO, in which semantic-spatial cross modality and novel bi-directional decoupled focus modules are designed to achieve the detection-centered mutual enhancement of RGB-infrared (RGB-IR). Specifically, a dual semantic enhancing channel weight assignment module (DECA) and a dual spatial enhancing pixel weight assignment module (DEPA) are firstly proposed to aggregate cross-modality information in the feature space to improve the feature representation ability, such that feature fusion can aim at the object detection task. Meanwhile, a dual-enhancement mechanism, including enhancements for two-modality fusion and single modality, is designed in both DECAand DEPAto reduce interference between the two kinds of image modalities. Then, a novel bi-directional decoupled focus is developed to enlarge the receptive field of the backbone network in different directions, which improves the representation quality of DEYOLO. Extensive experiments on M3FD and LLVIP show that our approach outperforms SOTA object detection algorithms by a clear margin.

Current methods typically apply direct fusion from the two modalities without valid supervision, failing to fully perceive the deep modality-complementary information and hence, resulting in a superficial understanding of inter-modality connections. To bridge this gap, we propose a simple and effective solution for unsupervised HIF with an assumption that modality decoupling is essential for HIF. We introduce the modality clustering loss that ensures clear guidance of the modality, decoupling towards modality-shared features while steering clear of modality-complementary ones. Also, we propose an end-to-end Modality-Decoupled Spatial-Spectral Fusion (MossFuse) framework that decouples shared and complementary information across modalities and aggregates a concise representation of the LR-HSI and HR-MSI to reduce the modality redundancy. Systematic experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our simple and effective approach consistently outperforms the existing HIF methods while requiring considerably fewer parameters with reduced inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently launched satellites can concurrently acquire HSIs and panchromatic (PAN) images, enabling the restoration of HSIs to generate clean and high-resolution imagery through fusing PAN images for denoising and super-resolution. However, previous studies treated these two tasks as independent processes, resulting in accumulated errors. This paper introduces \textbf{H}yperspectral \textbf{I}mage Joint \textbf{Pand}enoising \textbf{a}nd Pan\textbf{s}harpening (Hipandas), a novel learning paradigm that reconstructs HRHS images from noisy low-resolution HSIs (LRHS) and high-resolution PAN images. The proposed zero-shot Hipandas framework consists of a guided denoising network, a guided super-resolution network, and a PAN reconstruction network, utilizing an HSI low-rank prior and a newly introduced detail-oriented low-rank prior. The interconnection of these networks complicates the training process, necessitating a two-stage training strategy to ensure effective training. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world datasets indicate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms, yielding more accurate and visually pleasing HRHS images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Task-driven Image Fusion with Learnable Fusion Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03240v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal image fusion aggregates information from multiple sensor sources, achieving superior visual quality and perceptual characteristics compared to any single source, often enhancing downstream tasks. However, current fusion methods for downstream tasks still use predefined fusion objectives that potentially mismatch the downstream tasks, limiting adaptive guidance and reducing model flexibility. To address this, we propose Task-driven Image Fusion (TDFusion), a fusion framework incorporating a learnable fusion loss guided by task loss. Specifically, our fusion loss includes learnable parameters modeled by a neural network called the loss generation module. This module is supervised by the loss of downstream tasks in a meta-learning manner. The learning objective is to minimize the task loss of the fused images, once the fusion module has been optimized by the fusion loss. Iterative updates between the fusion module and the loss module ensure that the fusion network evolves toward minimizing task loss, guiding the fusion process toward the task objectives. TDFusion's training relies solely on the loss of downstream tasks, making it adaptable to any specific task. It can be applied to any architecture of fusion and task networks. Experiments demonstrate TDFusion's performance in both fusion and task-related applications, including four public fusion datasets, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10374v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current strong pedestrian attribute recognition models are developed based on Transformer networks, which are computationally heavy. Recently proposed models with linear complexity (e.g., Mamba) have garnered significant attention and have achieved a good balance between accuracy and computational cost across a variety of visual tasks. Relevant review articles also suggest that while these models can perform well on some pedestrian attribute recognition datasets, they are generally weaker than the corresponding Transformer models. To further tap into the potential of the novel Mamba architecture for PAR tasks, this paper designs and adapts Mamba into two typical PAR frameworks, i.e., the text-image fusion approach and pure vision Mamba multi-label recognition framework. It is found that interacting with attribute tags as additional input does not always lead to an improvement, specifically, Vim can be enhanced, but VMamba cannot. This paper further designs various hybrid Mamba-Transformer variants and conducts thorough experimental validations. These experimental results indicate that simply enhancing Mamba with a Transformer does not always lead to performance improvements but yields better results under certain settings. We hope this empirical study can further inspire research in Mamba for PAR, and even extend into the domain of multi-label recognition, through the design of these network structures and comprehensive experimentation.

| **[Conti-Fuse: A Novel Continuous Decomposition-based Fusion Framework for Infrared and Visible Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04689v3)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For better explore the relations of inter-modal and inner-modal, even in deep learning fusion framework, the concept of decomposition plays a crucial role. However, the previous decomposition strategies (base \& detail or low-frequency \& high-frequency) are too rough to present the common features and the unique features of source modalities, which leads to a decline in the quality of the fused images. The existing strategies treat these relations as a binary system, which may not be suitable for the complex generation task (e.g. image fusion). To address this issue, a continuous decomposition-based fusion framework (Conti-Fuse) is proposed. Conti-Fuse treats the decomposition results as few samples along the feature variation trajectory of the source images, extending this concept to a more general state to achieve continuous decomposition. This novel continuous decomposition strategy enhances the representation of complementary information of inter-modal by increasing the number of decomposition samples, thus reducing the loss of critical information. To facilitate this process, the continuous decomposition module (CDM) is introduced to decompose the input into a series continuous components. The core module of CDM, State Transformer (ST), is utilized to efficiently capture the complementary information from source modalities. Furthermore, a novel decomposition loss function is also designed which ensures the smooth progression of the decomposition process while maintaining linear growth in time complexity with respect to the number of decomposition samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed Conti-Fuse achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art fusion methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets and imaging systems lack pixel-level alignment between RGB and NIR images, posing challenges for downstream vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce a robotic vision system equipped with pixel-aligned RGB-NIR stereo cameras and a LiDAR sensor mounted on a mobile robot. The system simultaneously captures pixel-aligned pairs of RGB stereo images, NIR stereo images, and temporally synchronized LiDAR points. Utilizing the mobility of the robot, we present a dataset containing continuous video frames under diverse lighting conditions. We then introduce two methods that utilize the pixel-aligned RGB-NIR images: an RGB-NIR image fusion method and a feature fusion method. The first approach enables existing RGB-pretrained vision models to directly utilize RGB-NIR information without fine-tuning. The second approach fine-tunes existing vision models to more effectively utilize RGB-NIR information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using pixel-aligned RGB-NIR images across diverse lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages for main article, 32 pages for supplemental document.

| **[Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion with arbitrary resolution through self-supervised representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17818v2)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fusion of a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) has emerged as an effective technique for achieving HSI super-resolution (SR). Previous studies have mainly concentrated on estimating the posterior distribution of the latent high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI), leveraging an appropriate image prior and likelihood computed from the discrepancy between the latent HSI and observed images. Low rankness stands out for preserving latent HSI characteristics through matrix factorization among the various priors. However, the primary limitation in previous studies lies in the generalization of a fusion model with fixed resolution scales, which necessitates retraining whenever output resolutions are changed. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel continuous low-rank factorization (CLoRF) by integrating two neural representations into the matrix factorization, capturing spatial and spectral information, respectively. This approach enables us to harness both the low rankness from the matrix factorization and the continuity from neural representation in a self-supervised manner.Theoretically, we prove the low-rank property and Lipschitz continuity in the proposed continuous low-rank factorization. Experimentally, our method significantly surpasses existing techniques and achieves user-desired resolutions without the need for neural network retraining.

While convolutional neural networks have notably improved message capacity and imperceptibility, achieving high recovery accuracy remains challenging. This challenge arises because convolutional operations struggle to preserve the sequential order of message bits and effectively address the discrepancy between these two modalities. To address this, we propose StegaFormer, an innovative MLP-based framework designed to preserve bit order and enable global fusion between modalities. Specifically, StegaFormer incorporates three crucial components: Order-Preserving Message Encoder (OPME), Decoder (OPMD) and Global Message-Image Fusion (GMIF). OPME and OPMD aim to preserve the order of message bits by segmenting the entire sequence into equal-length segments and incorporating sequential information during encoding and decoding. Meanwhile, GMIF employs a cross-modality fusion mechanism to effectively fuse the features from the two uncorrelated modalities. Experimental results on the COCO and DIV2K datasets demonstrate that StegaFormer surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of recovery accuracy, message capacity, and imperceptibility. We will make our code publicly available.</p></details> | BMVC 2024 | None |
| **[A Multi-scale Information Integration Framework for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04328v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion aims at generating a fused image containing the intensity and detail information of source images, and the key issue is effectively measuring and integrating the complementary information of multi-modality images from the same scene. Existing methods mostly adopt a simple weight in the loss function to decide the information retention of each modality rather than adaptively measuring complementary information for different image pairs. In this study, we propose a multi-scale dual attention (MDA) framework for infrared and visible image fusion, which is designed to measure and integrate complementary information in both structure and loss function at the image and patch level. In our method, the residual downsample block decomposes source images into three scales first. Then, dual attention fusion block integrates complementary information and generates a spatial and channel attention map at each scale for feature fusion. Finally, the output image is reconstructed by the residual reconstruction block. Loss function consists of image-level, feature-level and patch-level three parts, of which the calculation of the image-level and patch-level two parts are based on the weights generated by the complementary information measurement. Indeed, to constrain the pixel intensity distribution between the output and infrared image, a style loss is added. Our fusion results perform robust and informative across different scenarios. Qualitative and quantitative results on two datasets illustrate that our method is able to preserve both thermal radiation and detailed information from two modalities and achieve comparable results compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments show the effectiveness of our information integration architecture and adaptively measure complementary information retention in the loss function.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have significantly advanced fusion performance, some of the existing CNN-based methods fall short in capturing fine-grained multiscale and edge features, leading to suboptimal feature integration. Transformer-based models, on the other hand, are computationally intensive in both the training and fusion stages, making them impractical for real-time clinical use. Moreover, the clinical application of fused images remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based architecture that addresses these limitations by introducing a Dilated Residual Attention Network Module for effective multiscale feature extraction, coupled with a gradient operator to enhance edge detail learning. To ensure fast and efficient fusion, we present a parameter-free fusion strategy based on the weighted nuclear norm of softmax, which requires no additional computations during training or inference.

Current deep learning (DL) methods typically employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction and information integration. While CNNs are efficient, their limited receptive fields restrict their ability to capture global context. Transformers excel at learning global information but are computationally expensive. Recent advancements in the state space model (SSM), particularly Mamba, present a promising alternative by enabling global perception with low complexity. However, the potential of SSM for information integration remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we propose FusionMamba, an innovative method for efficient remote sensing image fusion. Our contributions are twofold. First, to effectively merge spatial and spectral features, we expand the single-input Mamba block to accommodate dual inputs, creating the FusionMamba block, which serves as a plug-and-play solution for information integration. Second, we incorporate Mamba and FusionMamba blocks into an interpretable network architecture tailored for remote sensing image fusion. Our designs utilize two U-shaped network branches, each primarily composed of four-directional Mamba blocks, to extract spatial and spectral features separately and hierarchically. The resulting feature maps are sufficiently merged in an auxiliary network branch constructed with FusionMamba blocks. Furthermore, we improve the representation of spectral information through an enhanced channel attention module.

However, data collected from a realistic scene usually have a non-Euclidean structure, where Euclidean metric might be limited in representing the true data relationships, degrading fusion performance. To address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning framework is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SPDFusion, which extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with human visual perception. Actually, the SPD matrix underpins our network learning, with a cross-modal fusion strategy employed to harness modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information. Subsequently, an attention module is designed to process the learned weight matrix, facilitating the weighting of spatial global correlation semantics via SPD matrix multiplication. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion network based on cross-modal manifold learning. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our framework exhibits superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures | None |

They ignore the essential distinction between natural and medical image fusion and the influence of underlying components. This paper dissects the significant differences between the two tasks regarding fusion goals, statistical properties, and data distribution.

While traditional Machine Learning (TML) approaches have demonstrated effectiveness, they often encounter substantial obstacles in real-world applications, including the variability of optimal feature sets, subjectivity in human-driven design, inherent biases, and methodological limitations. Specifically, TML suffers from the curse of dimensionality, difficulties in feature selection and extraction, insufficient consideration of spatial information, limited robustness against noise, scalability issues, and inadequate adaptability to complex data distributions. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as robust solutions to address these challenges. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of current trends and future prospects in HSC, emphasizing advancements from DL models to the increasing adoption of Transformer and Mamba Model architectures.

However, existing MMIF methods lack the ability to resist different weather interferences in real-world scenes, preventing them from being useful in practical applications such as autonomous driving. To bridge this research gap, we proposed an all-weather MMIF model. Achieving effective multi-tasking in this context is particularly challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of weather conditions. A key obstacle lies in the 'black box' nature of current deep learning architectures, which restricts their multi-tasking capabilities. To overcome this, we decompose the network into two modules: a fusion module and a restoration module. For the fusion module, we introduce a learnable low-rank representation model to decompose images into low-rank and sparse components. This interpretable feature separation allows us to better observe and understand images. For the restoration module, we propose a physically-aware clear feature prediction module based on an atmospheric scattering model that can deduce variations in light transmittance from both scene illumination and reflectance. We also construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset with 100,000 image pairs across rain, haze, and snow conditions, covering various degradation levels and diverse scenes to thoroughly evaluate image fusion methods in adverse weather. Experimental results in both real-world and synthetic scenes show that the proposed algorithm excels in detail recovery and multi-modality feature extraction.

In this work, we introduce an interpretable network for the MMIF task, named FNet, based on an l0-regularized multi-modal convolutional sparse coding (MCSC) model. Specifically, for solving the l0-regularized CSC problem, we develop an algorithm unrolling-based l0-regularized sparse coding (LZSC) block. Given different modality source images, FNet first separates the unique and common features from them using the LZSC block and then these features are combined to generate the final fused image. Additionally, we propose an l0-regularized MCSC model for the inverse fusion process. Based on this model, we introduce an interpretable inverse fusion network named IFNet, which is utilized during FNet's training. Extensive experiments show that FNet achieves high-quality fusion results across five different MMIF tasks. Furthermore, we show that FNet enhances downstream object detection in visible-thermal image pairs. We have also visualized the intermediate results of FNet, which demonstrates the good interpretability of our network.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Test-Time Dynamic Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02840v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent challenge of image fusion lies in capturing the correlation of multi-source images and comprehensively integrating effective information from different sources. Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image fusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential deployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion with a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution from a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of image fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we decompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source data. The decomposed components represent the effective information from the source data, thus the gap between them reflects the Relative Dominability (RD) of the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we prove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source reconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant regions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding fusion weight, achieving robust results. Extensive experiments and discussions with in-depth analysis on multiple benchmarks confirm our findings and superiority.

| **[Conditional Controllable Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01573v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple input images acquired through various sources to synthesize a new fused image. Existing methods usually employ distinct constraint designs tailored to specific scenes, forming fixed fusion paradigms. However, this data-driven fusion approach is challenging to deploy in varying scenarios, especially in rapidly changing environments. To address this issue, we propose a conditional controllable fusion (CCF) framework for general image fusion tasks without specific training. Due to the dynamic differences of different samples, our CCF employs specific fusion constraints for each individual in practice. Given the powerful generative capabilities of the denoising diffusion model, we first inject the specific constraints into the pre-trained DDPM as adaptive fusion conditions. The appropriate conditions are dynamically selected to ensure the fusion process remains responsive to the specific requirements in each reverse diffusion stage. Thus, CCF enables conditionally calibrating the fused images step by step. Extensive experiments validate our effectiveness in general fusion tasks across diverse scenarios against the competing methods without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

Additionally, these methods often overlook the specificity of foreground objects, weakening the salience of the objects of interest within the fused images. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel interactive multi-modal image fusion framework based on the text-modulated diffusion model, called Text-DiFuse. First, this framework integrates feature-level information integration into the diffusion process, allowing adaptive degradation removal and multi-modal information fusion. This is the first attempt to deeply and explicitly embed information fusion within the diffusion process, effectively addressing compound degradation in image fusion. Second, by embedding the combination of the text and zero-shot location model into the diffusion fusion process, a text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy is developed. This enables user-customized text control to improve fusion performance and highlight foreground objects in the fused images. Extensive experiments on diverse public datasets show that our Text-DiFuse achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance across various scenarios with complex degradation. Moreover, the semantic segmentation experiment validates the significant enhancement in semantic performance achieved by our text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy.

Most existing algorithms only perform pixel-level or feature-level fusion from different modalities in the spatial domain. They usually overlook the information in the frequency domain, and some of them suffer from inefficiency due to excessively complex structures. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient Spatial-Frequency Domain Fusion (SFDFusion) network for infrared and visible image fusion. First, we propose a Dual-Modality Refinement Module (DMRM) to extract complementary information. This module extracts useful information from both the infrared and visible modalities in the spatial domain and enhances fine-grained spatial details. Next, to introduce frequency domain information, we construct a Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) that transforms the spatial domain to the frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and then integrates frequency domain information. Additionally, we design a frequency domain fusion loss to provide guidance for the fusion process. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method produces fused images with significant advantages in various fusion metrics and visual effects. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high efficiency in image fusion and good performance on downstream detection tasks, thereby satisfying the real-time demands of advanced visual tasks.</p></details> | accept in ECAI 2024 | None |

To this end, we rethink the IVIF outside the box, proposing a complementary to harmonious information transfer network (CHITNet). It reasonably transfers complementary information into harmonious one, which integrates both the shared and complementary features from two modalities. Specifically, to skillfully sidestep aggregating complementary information in IVIF, we design a mutual information transfer (MIT) module to mutually represent features from two modalities, roughly transferring complementary information into harmonious one. Then, a harmonious information acquisition supervised by source image (HIASSI) module is devised to further ensure the complementary to harmonious information transfer after MIT. Meanwhile, we also propose a structure information preservation (SIP) module to guarantee that the edge structure information of the source images can be transferred to the fusion results. Moreover, a mutual promotion training paradigm with interaction loss is adopted to facilitate better collaboration among MIT, HIASSI and SIP. In this way, the proposed method is able to generate fused images with higher qualities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CHITNet over state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of visual quality and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

The aim of MEF-based tone mapping is to display high dynamic range (HDR) images on devices with limited dynamic range. To achieve this, this method generates a stack of differently exposed images from an input HDR image and fuses them into a single image. Our approach addresses the limitations of MEF-based tone mapping with existing segmentation-based exposure compensation, which often result in visually unappealing outcomes due to inappropriate exposure value selection. The proposed exposure compensation method first segments the input HDR image into subregions based on luminance values of pixels. It then determines exposure values for multi-exposure images to maximize contrast between regions while preserving relative luminance relationships. This approach contrasts with conventional methods that may invert luminance relationships or compromise contrast between regions. Additionally, we present an improved technique for calculating fusion weights to better reflect the effects of exposure compensation in the final fused image. In a simulation experiment to evaluate the quality of tone-mapped images, the MEF-based tone mapping with the proposed method outperforms three typical tone mapping methods including conventional MEF-based one, in terms of the tone mapped image quality index (TMQI).</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be presented in APSIPA ASC 2024</p></details> | None |

The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page | None |

However, due to the limitations of imaging equipment and considerations for patient safety, the quality of medical images is usually limited, leading to sub-optimal fusion performance, and affecting the depth of image analysis by the physician. Thus, there is an urgent need for a technology that can both enhance image resolution and integrate multi-modal information. Although current image processing methods can effectively address image fusion and super-resolution individually, solving both problems synchronously remains extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose TFS-Diff, a simultaneously realize tri-modal medical image fusion and super-resolution model. Specially, TFS-Diff is based on the diffusion model generation of a random iterative denoising process. We also develop a simple objective function and the proposed fusion super-resolution loss, effectively evaluates the uncertainty in the fusion and ensures the stability of the optimization process. And the channel attention module is proposed to effectively integrate key information from different modalities for clinical diagnosis, avoiding information loss caused by multiple image processing.

All the features are extracted from normalized left and right hand images. Fusion is applied at feature level and also at decision level. Two probability based algorithms are proposed for classification. The first algorithm computes the maximum probability for nearest three neighbors. The second algorithm determines the maximum probability of the number of matched features with respect to a thresholding on distances. Based on these two highest probabilities initial decisions are made. The final decision is considered according to the highest probability as calculated by the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Depending on the various combinations of the initial decisions, three schemes are experimented with 201 subjects for identification and verification. The correct identification rate found to be 99.5%, and the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.625% has been found during verification.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the evaluation of VIF methods remains challenging due to the absence of ground truth. This paper proposes a Segmentation-oriented Evaluation Approach (SEA) to assess VIF methods by incorporating the semantic segmentation task and leveraging segmentation labels available in latest VIF datasets. Specifically, SEA utilizes universal segmentation models, capable of handling diverse images and classes, to predict segmentation outputs from fused images and compare these outputs with segmentation labels. Our evaluation of recent VIF methods using SEA reveals that their performance is comparable or even inferior to using visible images only, despite nearly half of the infrared images demonstrating better performance than visible images. Further analysis indicates that the two metrics most correlated to our SEA are the gradient-based fusion metric $Q_{\text{ABF}}$ and the visual information fidelity metric $Q_{\text{VIFF}}$ in conventional VIF evaluation metrics, which can serve as proxies when segmentation labels are unavailable.

Therefore, extending depth of field (EDoF) is a fundamental task for meeting the requirements of emerging visual applications. To solve this task, the common practice is using multi-focus images from a single viewpoint. This method can obtain acceptable quality of EDoF under the condition of fixed field of view, but it is only applicable to static scenes and the field of view is limited and fixed. An emerging data type, varifocal multiview images have the potential to become a new paradigm for solving the EDoF, because the data contains more field of view information than multi-focus images. To realize EDoF of varifocal multiview images, we propose an end-to-end method for the EDoF, including image alignment, image optimization and image fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

We design a novel deep Tucker decomposition network that maps LR-HSI and HR-MSI into a consistent feature space, achieving reconstruction through decoders with shared parameter. To better exploit and fuse spatial-spectral features in the data, we design a core tensor fusion network that incorporates a spatial spectral attention mechanism for aligning and fusing features at different scales. Furthermore, to enhance the capacity in capturing global information, a Laplacian-based spatial-spectral manifold constraints is introduced in shared-decoders.

However, due to the significant differences between the two modalities, preserving key features during the fusion process remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a dual-branch feature decomposition fusion network (DAF-Net) with domain adaptive, which introduces Multi-Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK-MMD) into the base encoder and designs a hybrid kernel function suitable for infrared and visible image fusion. The base encoder built on the Restormer network captures global structural information while the detail encoder based on Invertible Neural Networks (INN) focuses on extracting detail texture information. By incorporating MK-MMD, the DAF-Net effectively aligns the latent feature spaces of visible and infrared images, thereby improving the quality of the fused images.

We argue the current feature-level fusion strategy is prone to semantic inconsistencies and misalignments across various imaging modalities because it merges features at intermediate layers in a neural network without evaluative control. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel image-level fusion based multi-modality medical image segmentation method, Fuse4Seg, which is a bi-level learning framework designed to model the intertwined dependencies between medical image segmentation and medical image fusion. The image-level fusion process is seamlessly employed to guide and enhance the segmentation results through a layered optimization approach. Besides, the knowledge gained from the segmentation module can effectively enhance the fusion module. This ensures that the resultant fused image is a coherent representation that accurately amalgamates information from all modalities. Moreover, we construct a BraTS-Fuse benchmark based on BraTS dataset, which includes 2040 paired original images, multi-modal fusion images, and ground truth. This benchmark not only serves image-level medical segmentation but is also the largest dataset for medical image fusion to date. Extensive experiments on several public datasets and our benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our approach over prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Many end-to-end specialized models based on deep learning (DL) have been proposed, yet the scale and performance of these models are limited by the size of dataset. Given the superior parameter scales and feature representations of pre-trained models, they exhibit outstanding performance when transferred to downstream tasks with small datasets. Therefore, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method, namely PanAdapter, which utilizes additional advanced semantic information from pre-trained models to alleviate the issue of small-scale datasets in pansharpening tasks. Specifically, targeting the large domain discrepancy between image restoration and pansharpening tasks, the PanAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy for progressively adapting to the downstream task. In the first stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN model and extract task-specific priors at two scales by proposed Local Prior Extraction (LPE) module. In the second stage, we feed the extracted two-scale priors into two branches of cascaded adapters respectively. At each adapter, we design two parameter-efficient modules for allowing the two branches to interact and be injected into the frozen pre-trained VisionTransformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that by only training the proposed LPE modules and adapters with a small number of parameters, our approach can benefit from pre-trained image restoration models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark pansharpening datasets.

However, due to the heavy reliance on deep learning technologies, particularly for future connected and autonomous driving, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that pose significant safety risks to both personal and public transportation. Notably, researchers recently identified a new attack vector to deceive sign recognition systems: projecting well-designed adversarial light patches onto traffic signs. In comparison with traditional adversarial stickers or graffiti, these emerging light patches exhibit heightened aggression due to their ease of implementation and outstanding stealthiness. To effectively counter this security threat, we propose a universal image inpainting mechanism, namely, SafeSign. It relies on attention-enabled multi-view image fusion to repair traffic signs contaminated by adversarial light patches, thereby ensuring the accurate sign recognition. Here, we initially explore the fundamental impact of malicious light patches on the local and global feature spaces of authentic traffic signs. Then, we design a binary mask-based U-Net image generation pipeline outputting diverse contaminated sign patterns, to provide our image inpainting model with needed training data. Following this, we develop an attention mechanism-enabled neural network to jointly utilize the complementary information from multi-view images to repair contaminated signs. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate SafeSign's effectiveness in resisting potential light patch-based attacks, bringing an average accuracy improvement of 54.8% in three widely-used sign recognition models</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing feature extraction and fusion methods are either constrained by inherent local reduction bias and static parameters during inference (CNN) or limited by quadratic computational complexity (Transformers), and cannot effectively extract and fuse features. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-branch image fusion network called Tmamba. It consists of linear Transformer and Mamba, which has global modeling capabilities while maintaining linear complexity. Due to the difference between the Transformer and Mamba structures, the features extracted by the two branches carry channel and position information respectively. T-M interaction structure is designed between the two branches, using global learnable parameters and convolutional layers to transfer position and channel information respectively. We further propose cross-modal interaction at the attention level to obtain cross-modal attention. Experiments show that our Tmamba achieves promising results in multiple fusion tasks, including infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion. Code with checkpoints will be available after the peer-review process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Head Attention Residual Unfolded Network for Model-Based Pansharpening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02675v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of pansharpening and hypersharpening is to accurately combine a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (MS) or hyperspectral (HS) image, respectively. Unfolding fusion methods integrate the powerful representation capabilities of deep learning with the robustness of model-based approaches. These techniques involve unrolling the steps of the optimization scheme derived from the minimization of an energy into a deep learning framework, resulting in efficient and highly interpretable architectures. In this paper, we propose a model-based deep unfolded method for satellite image fusion. Our approach is based on a variational formulation that incorporates the classic observation model for MS/HS data, a high-frequency injection constraint based on the PAN image, and an arbitrary convex prior. For the unfolding stage, we introduce upsampling and downsampling layers that use geometric information encoded in the PAN image through residual networks. The backbone of our method is a multi-head attention residual network (MARNet), which replaces the proximity operator in the optimization scheme and combines multiple head attentions with residual learning to exploit image self-similarities via nonlocal operators defined in terms of patches. Additionally, we incorporate a post-processing module based on the MARNet architecture to further enhance the quality of the fused images. Experimental results on PRISMA, Quickbird, and WorldView2 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method and its ability to generalize across different sensor configurations and varying spatial and spectral resolutions.

Although State-Space Models, such as Mamba, are proficient in long-range modeling with linear complexity, most Mamba-based approaches use fixed scanning strategies, which can introduce biased prior information. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Bayesian-inspired scanning strategy called Random Shuffle, supplemented by an theoretically-feasible inverse shuffle to maintain information coordination invariance, aiming to eliminate biases associated with fixed sequence scanning. Based on this transformation pair, we customized the Shuffle Mamba Framework, penetrating modality-aware information representation and cross-modality information interaction across spatial and channel axes to ensure robust interaction and an unbiased global receptive field for multi-modal image fusion. Furthermore, we develop a testing methodology based on Monte-Carlo averaging to ensure the model's output aligns more closely with expected results. Extensive experiments across multiple multi-modal image fusion tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, yielding excellent fusion quality over state-of-the-art alternatives. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

Thermal radiation information is mainly expressed through image intensities, while texture details are typically expressed through image gradients. However, existing dual-discriminator generative adversarial networks (GANs) often rely on two structurally identical discriminators for learning, which do not fully account for the distinct learning needs of infrared and visible image information. To this end, this paper proposes a novel GAN with a heterogeneous dual-discriminator network and an attention-based fusion strategy (GAN-HA). Specifically, recognizing the intrinsic differences between infrared and visible images, we propose, for the first time, a novel heterogeneous dual-discriminator network to simultaneously capture thermal radiation information and texture details. The two discriminators in this network are structurally different, including a salient discriminator for infrared images and a detailed discriminator for visible images. They are able to learn rich image intensity information and image gradient information, respectively. In addition, a new attention-based fusion strategy is designed in the generator to appropriately emphasize the learned information from different source images, thereby improving the information representation ability of the fusion result. In this way, the fused images generated by GAN-HA can more effectively maintain both the salience of thermal targets and the sharpness of textures. Extensive experiments on various public datasets demonstrate the superiority of GAN-HA over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms while showcasing its higher potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the prevailing focus has predominantly been on the architecture design, rather than the training strategies. As a low-level vision task, image fusion is supposed to quickly deliver output images for observation and supporting downstream tasks. Thus, superfluous computational and storage overheads should be avoided. In this work, a lightweight Distilled Mini-Model with a Dynamic Refresh strategy (MMDRFuse) is proposed to achieve this objective. To pursue model parsimony, an extremely small convolutional network with a total of 113 trainable parameters (0.44 KB) is obtained by three carefully designed supervisions. First, digestible distillation is constructed by emphasising external spatial feature consistency, delivering soft supervision with balanced details and saliency for the target network. Second, we develop a comprehensive loss to balance the pixel, gradient, and perception clues from the source images. Third, an innovative dynamic refresh training strategy is used to collaborate history parameters and current supervision during training, together with an adaptive adjust function to optimise the fusion network. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits promising advantages in terms of model efficiency and complexity, with superior performance in multiple image fusion tasks and downstream pedestrian detection application.

However, two major stumbling blocks hinder the development, including pixel misalignment and inefficient inference. Reliance on aligned image pairs in existing methods causes susceptibility to artifacts due to device motion. Additionally, existing techniques often rely on handcrafted architectures with huge network engineering, resulting in redundant parameters, adversely impacting inference efficiency and flexibility. To mitigate these limitations, this study introduces an architecture search-based paradigm incorporating self-alignment and detail repletion modules for robust multi-exposure image fusion. Specifically, targeting the extreme discrepancy of exposure, we propose the self-alignment module, leveraging scene relighting to constrain the illumination degree for following alignment and feature extraction. Detail repletion is proposed to enhance the texture details of scenes. Additionally, incorporating a hardware-sensitive constraint, we present the fusion-oriented architecture search to explore compact and efficient networks for fusion. The proposed method outperforms various competitive schemes, achieving a noteworthy 3.19\% improvement in PSNR for general scenarios and an impressive 23.5\% enhancement in misaligned scenarios. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference time by 69.1\%.

However, current models struggle to efficiently segment densely packed elements in such scenes, due to the absence of comprehensive fusion features that can guide mid-process fine-tuning and focus attention on relevant areas. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a transformative segmentation method. It provides more effective prompts through its flexible prompt encoder, compared to transformers lacking fine-tuned control. Nevertheless, SAM has not been extensively studied in the domain of multimodal fusion for natural images. In this paper, we introduce SAM into multimodal image segmentation for the first time, proposing a novel framework that combines Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) modules to enhance SAM's multimodal fusion and segmentation capabilities. Specifically, we first obtain latent space features of the two modalities through vector quantization and embed them into a cross-attention-based inter-domain fusion module to establish long-range dependencies between modalities. Then, we use these comprehensive fusion features as prompts to guide precise pixel-level segmentation. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms SAM and SAM2 in multimodal autonomous driving scenarios, achieving at least 3.9$\%$ higher segmentation mIoU than the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

This has driven the development of numerous methods to explore better ways of fusing them while preserving their respective characteristics.Mamba, as a state space model, has emerged in the field of natural language processing. Recently, many studies have attempted to extend Mamba to vision tasks. However, due to the nature of images different from causal language sequences, the limited state capacity of Mamba weakens its ability to model image information. Additionally, the sequence modeling ability of Mamba is only capable of spatial information and cannot effectively capture the rich spectral information in images. Motivated by these challenges, we customize and improve the vision Mamba network designed for the image fusion task. Specifically, we propose the local-enhanced vision Mamba block, dubbed as LEVM. The LEVM block can improve local information perception of the network and simultaneously learn local and global spatial information. Furthermore, we propose the state sharing technique to enhance spatial details and integrate spatial and spectral information. Finally, the overall network is a multi-scale structure based on vision Mamba, called LE-Mamba. Extensive experiments show the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results on multispectral pansharpening and multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Historically, most methodologies have predominantly utilized spatial domain recovery, offering limited consideration to the potentialities of the frequency domain. Additionally, there has been a lack of a unified perspective towards low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, complicating and impeding the optimization of image processing. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology that leverages the frequency domain to improve and unify the handling of exposure correction tasks. Our method introduces Holistic Frequency Attention and Dynamic Frequency Feed-Forward Network, which replace conventional correlation computation in the spatial-domain. They form a foundational building block that facilitates a U-shaped Holistic Dynamic Frequency Transformer as a filter to extract global information and dynamically select important frequency bands for image restoration. Complementing this, we employ a Laplacian pyramid to decompose images into distinct frequency bands, followed by multiple restorers, each tuned to recover specific frequency-band information. The pyramid fusion allows a more detailed and nuanced image restoration process. Ultimately, our structure unifies the three tasks of low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, enabling comprehensive treatment of all classical exposure errors. Benchmarking on mainstream datasets for these tasks, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, paving the way for more sophisticated and unified solutions in exposure correction.</p></details> |  | None |

To tackle the problem of insufficient feature extraction and lack of semantic awareness for complex scenes, this paper focuses on how to model correlation-driven decomposing features and reason high-level graph representation by efficiently extracting complementary features and multi-guided feature aggregation. We propose a three-branch encoder-decoder architecture along with corresponding fusion layers as the fusion strategy. The transformer with Multi-Dconv Transposed Attention and Local-enhanced Feed Forward network is used to extract shallow features after the depthwise convolution. In the three parallel branches encoder, Cross Attention and Invertible Block (CAI) enables to extract local features and preserve high-frequency texture details. Base feature extraction module (BFE) with residual connections can capture long-range dependency and enhance shared-modality expression capabilities. Graph Reasoning Module (GR) is introduced to reason high-level cross-modality relations and extract low-level details features as CAI's specific-modality complementary information simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our method has obtained competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in visible/infrared image fusion and medical image fusion tasks. Moreover, we surpass other fusion methods in terms of subsequent tasks, averagely scoring 8.27% mAP@0.5 higher in object detection and 5.85% mIoU higher in semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FCDFusion: a Fast, Low Color Deviation Method for Fusing Visible and Infrared Image Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01080v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) aims to combine information from visible and infrared images into a single fused image. Previous VIF methods usually employ a color space transformation to keep the hue and saturation from the original visible image. However, for fast VIF methods, this operation accounts for the majority of the calculation and is the bottleneck preventing faster processing. In this paper, we propose a fast fusion method, FCDFusion, with little color deviation. It preserves color information without color space transformations, by directly operating in RGB color space. It incorporates gamma correction at little extra cost, allowing color and contrast to be rapidly improved. We regard the fusion process as a scaling operation on 3D color vectors, greatly simplifying the calculations. A theoretical analysis and experiments show that our method can achieve satisfactory results in only 7 FLOPs per pixel. Compared to state-of-the-art fast, color-preserving methods using HSV color space, our method provides higher contrast at only half of the computational cost. We further propose a new metric, color deviation, to measure the ability of a VIF method to preserve color. It is specifically designed for VIF tasks with color visible-light images, and overcomes deficiencies of existing VIF metrics used for this purpose.

Existing deep learning-based approaches insufficiently focus on retinal image fusion, and thus fail to preserve enough anatomical structure and fine vessel details in retinal image fusion. To address this, we propose the Topology-Aware Graph Attention Network (TaGAT) for multi-modal retinal image fusion, leveraging a novel Topology-Aware Encoder (TAE) with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to effectively enhance spatial features with retinal vasculature's graph topology across modalities. The TAE encodes the base and detail features, extracted via a Long-short Range (LSR) encoder from retinal images, into the graph extracted from the retinal vessel. Within the TAE, the GAT-based Graph Information Update (GIU) block dynamically refines and aggregates the node features to generate topology-aware graph features. The updated graph features with base and detail features are combined and decoded as a fused image. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Fluorescein Fundus Angiography (FFA) with Color Fundus (CF) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with confocal microscopy retinal image fusion.

However, the existing task-driven methods fail to address the domain gap between semantic and geometric representation. To overcome these issues, we propose a high-level vision task-driven infrared and visible image fusion network via semantic and geometric domain transformation, terms as HSFusion. Specifically, to minimize the gap between semantic and geometric representation, we design two separate domain transformation branches by CycleGAN framework, and each includes two processes: the forward segmentation process and the reverse reconstruction process. CycleGAN is capable of learning domain transformation patterns, and the reconstruction process of CycleGAN is conducted under the constraint of these patterns. Thus, our method can significantly facilitate the integration of semantic and geometric information and further reduces the domain gap. In fusion stage, we integrate the infrared and visible features that extracted from the reconstruction process of two seperate CycleGANs to obtain the fused result. These features, containing varying proportions of semantic and geometric information, can significantly enhance the high level vision tasks. Additionally, we generate masks based on segmentation results to guide the fusion task. These masks can provide semantic priors, and we design adaptive weights for two distinct areas in the masks to facilitate image fusion. Finally, we conducted comparative experiments between our method and eleven other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our approach surpasses others in both visual appeal and semantic segmentation task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the existing fusion algorithms tend to symmetrically fuse the multi-modal images, causing the loss of shallow information or bias towards a single modality in certain regions of the fusion results. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution differences of information in different modalities and proved that encoding features within the same network is not conducive to achieving simultaneous deep feature space alignment for multi-modal images. To overcome this issue, a Multi-Modal Asymmetric UNet (MMA-UNet) was proposed. We separately trained specialized feature encoders for different modal and implemented a cross-scale fusion strategy to maintain the features from different modalities within the same representation space, ensuring a balanced information fusion process. Furthermore, extensive fusion and downstream task experiments were conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of MMA-UNet in fusing infrared and visible image information, producing visually natural and semantically rich fusion results. Its performance surpasses that of the state-of-the-art comparison fusion methods.</p></details> |  | None |

MDLatLRR has done a great job in this aspect, but there is still exist some space for improvement. Considering that MDLatLRR focuses solely on the detailed parts (salient features) extracted from input images via latent low-rank representation (LatLRR), the basic parts (principal features) extracted by LatLRR are not fully utilized. Therefore, we introduced an enhanced multi-level decomposition method named dual-decomposed MDLatLRR (D2-LRR) which effectively analyzes and utilizes all image features extracted through LatLRR. Specifically, color images are converted into YUV color space and grayscale images, and the Y-channel and grayscale images are input into the trained parameters of LatLRR to obtain the detailed parts containing four rounds of decomposition and the basic parts. Subsequently, the basic parts are fused using an average strategy, while the detail part is fused using kernel norm operation. The fused image is ultimately transformed back into an RGB image, resulting in the final fusion output. We apply D2-LRR to medical image fusion tasks. The detailed parts are fused employing a nuclear-norm operation, while the basic parts are fused using an average strategy.

However, most of the spectral response functions and spatial downsampling functions used to create the simulated datasets are not entirely accurate, resulting in deviations in spatial and spectral features between the generated images for fusion and the real images for fusion. This reduces the credibility of the fusion algorithm, causing unfairness in the comparison between different algorithms and hindering the development of the field of hyperspectral image fusion. Therefore, we release a real HSI/MSI/PAN image dataset to promote the development of the field of hyperspectral image fusion. These three images are spatially registered, meaning fusion can be performed between HSI and MSI, HSI and PAN image, MSI and PAN image, as well as among HSI, MSI, and PAN image.

The study explores various combinations of fusion methods, fusion weights, number of frames, and stacking (a.k.a. merging) techniques using a proprietary dataset of images captured with Motorola smartphones. The objective was to identify optimal configurations that balance computational efficiency with image quality. Our results indicate that multi-scale methods and their single-scale fusion counterparts return similar image quality measures and runtime, but single-scale ones have lower memory usage. Furthermore, we identified that fusion methods operating in the YUV color space yield better performance in terms of image quality, resource utilization, and runtime. The study also shows that fusion weights have an overall small impact on image quality, runtime, and memory. Moreover, our results reveal that increasing the number of highly exposed input frames does not necessarily improve image quality and comes with a corresponding increase in computational resources usage and runtime; and that stacking methods, although reducing memory usage, may compromise image quality. Finally, our work underscores the importance of thoughtful configuration selection for image fusion techniques in constrained environments and offers insights for future image fusion method development, particularly in the realm of smartphone applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the ICMLAI 2024, in Mendonza, Argentina</p></details> | None |

Yet, the acquisition of high-resolution (HR) hyperspectral images (HSIs) often needs to be addressed due to the hardware limitations of existing imaging systems. A prevalent workaround involves capturing both a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) and a low-resolution (LR) HSI, subsequently fusing them to yield the desired HR-HSI. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promising in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion and LR-HSI super-resolution (SR), their substantial model complexities hinder deployment on resource-constrained imaging devices. This paper introduces a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework for HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion to achieve SR of LR-HSI. Our KD framework integrates the proposed Cross-Layer Residual Aggregation (CLRA) block to enhance efficiency for constructing Dual Two-Streamed (DTS) network structure, designed to extract joint and distinct features from LR-HSI and HR-MSI simultaneously. To fully exploit the spatial and spectral feature representations of LR-HSI and HR-MSI, we propose a novel Cross Self-Attention (CSA) fusion module to adaptively fuse those features to improve the spatial and spectral quality of the reconstructed HR-HSI. Finally, the proposed KD-based joint loss function is employed to co-train the teacher and student networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the student model not only achieves comparable or superior LR-HSI SR performance but also significantly reduces the model-size and computational requirements. This marks a substantial advancement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Most existing works utilize pretrained deep neural networks or design sophisticated frameworks with strong priors for this task, which may be unsuitable or lack flexibility. This paper presents SimpleFusion, a simple yet effective framework for visible and infrared image fusion. Our framework follows the decompose-and-fusion paradigm, where the visible and the infrared images are decomposed into reflectance and illumination components via Retinex theory and followed by the fusion of these corresponding elements. The whole framework is designed with two plain convolutional neural networks without downsampling, which can perform image decomposition and fusion efficiently. Moreover, we introduce decomposition loss and a detail-to-semantic loss to preserve the complementary information between the two modalities for fusion. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging benchmarks, verifying the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-arts.

However the complementary information is hard to extract, especially for infrared and visible images which contain big similarity gap between these two modalities. The common cross attention modules only consider the correlation, on the contrary, image fusion tasks need focus on complementarity (uncorrelation). Hence, in this paper, a novel cross attention mechanism (CAM) is proposed to enhance the complementary information. Furthermore, a two-stage training strategy based fusion scheme is presented to generate the fused images. For the first stage, two auto-encoder networks with same architecture are trained for each modality. Then, with the fixed encoders, the CAM and a decoder are trained in the second stage. With the trained CAM, features extracted from two modalities are integrated into one fused feature in which the complementary information is enhanced and the redundant features are reduced. Finally, the fused image can be generated by the trained decoder. The experimental results illustrate that our proposed fusion method obtains the SOTA fusion performance compared with the existing fusion networks.

However, current generative models based fusion methods often suffer from unstable training and slow inference speed. To tackle this problem, a novel fusion method based on consistency model is proposed, termed as CoMoFusion, which can generate the high-quality images and achieve fast image inference speed. In specific, the consistency model is used to construct multi-modal joint features in the latent space with the forward and reverse process. Then, the infrared and visible features extracted by the trained consistency model are fed into fusion module to generate the final fused image. In order to enhance the texture and salient information of fused images, a novel loss based on pixel value selection is also designed.

However, for clinical experts, solely relying on fused images may be insufficient for making diagnostic decisions, as the fusion mechanism blends features from source images, thereby making it difficult to interpret the underlying tumor pathology. We introduce FusionINN, a novel decomposable image fusion framework, capable of efficiently generating fused images and also decomposing them back to the source images. FusionINN is designed to be bijective by including a latent image alongside the fused image, while ensuring minimal transfer of information from the source images to the latent representation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the decomposability of fused images, which is particularly crucial for life-sensitive applications such as medical image fusion compared to other tasks like multi-focus or multi-exposure image fusion. Our extensive experimentation validates FusionINN over existing discriminative and generative fusion methods, both subjectively and objectively. Moreover, compared to a recent denoising diffusion-based fusion model, our approach offers faster and qualitatively better fusion results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI Workshop 2024.

To overcome this limitation, a straightforward approach is to utilize high dynamic range (HDR) imaging through multi-exposure image fusion (MEF). This method involves capturing measurements at different exposure times, spanning from under to overexposure and fusing them into a single HDR image. The conventional MEF technique in ptychography typically involves subtracting the background noise, ignoring the saturated pixels and then merging the acquisitions. However, this approach is inadequate under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, variations in illumination intensity significantly affect the phase retrieval process. To address these issues, we propose a Bayesian MEF modeling approach based on a modified Poisson distribution that takes the background and saturation into account. To infer the model parameters, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is employed. As demonstrated with synthetic and experimental data, our approach outperforms the conventional MEF method, offering superior phase retrieval under challenging experimental conditions. This work underscores the significance of robust multi-exposure image fusion for ptychography, particularly in imaging shot-noise-dominated weakly scattering specimens or in cases where access to HDR detectors with high SNR is limited. Furthermore, the applicability of the Bayesian MEF approach extends beyond CDI to any imaging scheme that requires HDR treatment. Given this versatility, we provide the implementation of our algorithm as a Python package.</p></details> |  | None |

The Selective State Space Model (SSSM), known for its ability to capture long-range dependencies, has demonstrated its potential in the field of computer vision. However, in image fusion, current methods underestimate the potential of SSSM in capturing the global spatial information of both modalities. This limitation prevents the simultaneous consideration of the global spatial information from both modalities during interaction, leading to a lack of comprehensive perception of salient targets. Consequently, the fusion results tend to bias towards one modality instead of adaptively preserving salient targets. To address this issue, we propose the Saliency-aware Selective State Space Fusion Model (S4Fusion). In our S4Fusion, the designed Cross-Modal Spatial Awareness Module (CMSA) can simultaneously focus on global spatial information from both modalities while facilitating their interaction, thereby comprehensively capturing complementary information. Additionally, S4Fusion leverages a pre-trained network to perceive uncertainty in the fused images. By minimizing this uncertainty, S4Fusion adaptively highlights salient targets from both images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality images and enhances performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

It is necessary to perform automatic segmentation of brain tumors on MRI images. This project intends to build an MRI algorithm based on U-Net. The residual network and the module used to enhance the context information are combined, and the void space convolution pooling pyramid is added to the network for processing. The brain glioma MRI image dataset provided by cancer imaging archives was experimentally verified. A multi-scale segmentation method based on a weighted least squares filter was used to complete the 3D reconstruction of brain tumors. Thus, the accuracy of three-dimensional reconstruction is further improved. Experiments show that the local texture features obtained by the proposed algorithm are similar to those obtained by laser scanning. The algorithm is improved by using the U-Net method and an accuracy of 0.9851 is obtained. This approach significantly enhances the precision of image segmentation and boosts the efficiency of image classification.</p></details> |  | None |

The nonlinear radiometric differences between heterogeneous remote sensing images make the image matching task even more difficult. Deep learning has gained substantial attention in computer vision tasks in recent years. However, many methods rely on supervised learning and necessitate large amounts of annotated data. Nevertheless, annotated data is frequently limited in the field of remote sensing image matching. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel keypoint descriptor approach that obtains robust feature descriptors via a self-supervised matching network. A light-weight transformer network, termed as LTFormer, is designed to generate deep-level feature descriptors. Furthermore, we implement an innovative triplet loss function, LT Loss, to enhance the matching performance further. Our approach outperforms conventional hand-crafted local feature descriptors and proves equally competitive compared to state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, even amidst the shortage of annotated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> | None |

By integrating simultaneously captured wide-angle and telephoto images from these systems, the resulting fused image achieves a wide field of view (FOV) coupled with high-definition quality. Existing approaches are mostly deep learning methods, and predominantly rely on supervised learning, where the training dataset plays a pivotal role. However, current datasets typically adopt a data synthesis approach generate input pairs of wide-angle and telephoto images alongside ground-truth images. Notably, the wide-angle inputs are synthesized rather than captured using real wide-angle cameras, and the ground-truth image is captured by wide-angle camera whose quality is substantially lower than that of input telephoto images captured by telephoto cameras. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel hardware setup utilizing a beam splitter to simultaneously capture three images, i.e. input pairs and ground-truth images, from two authentic cellphones equipped with wide-angle and telephoto dual cameras. Specifically, the wide-angle and telephoto images captured by cellphone 2 serve as the input pair, while the telephoto image captured by cellphone 1, which is calibrated to match the optical path of the wide-angle image from cellphone 2, serves as the ground-truth image, maintaining quality on par with the input telephoto image. Experiments validate the efficacy of our newly introduced dataset, named ReWiTe, significantly enhances the performance of various existing methods for real-world wide-angle and telephoto dual image fusion tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in doing so, a bias is introduced toward the SSIM and, consequently, the input visual band image. The objective of this study is to propose a novel methodology for the image fusion problem that mitigates the limitations associated with using classical evaluation metrics as loss functions. Our approach integrates a transformer-based multi-scale fusion strategy that adeptly addresses local and global context information. This integration not only refines the individual components of the image fusion process but also significantly enhances the overall efficacy of the method. Our proposed method follows a two-stage training approach, where an auto-encoder is initially trained to extract deep features at multiple scales in the first stage. For the second stage, we integrate our fusion block and change the loss function as mentioned. The multi-scale features are fused using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. The CNNs are utilized to capture local features, while the Transformer handles the integration of general context features. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, our proposed method, along with the novel loss function definition, demonstrates superior performance compared to other competitive fusion algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

However, INR is prone to losing high-frequency information and is confined to the lack of global perceptual capabilities. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Fourier-enhanced Implicit Neural Fusion Network (FeINFN) specifically designed for MHIF task, targeting the following phenomena: The Fourier amplitudes of the HR-HSI latent code and LR-HSI are remarkably similar; however, their phases exhibit different patterns. In FeINFN, we innovatively propose a spatial and frequency implicit fusion function (Spa-Fre IFF), helping INR capture high-frequency information and expanding the receptive field. Besides, a new decoder employing a complex Gabor wavelet activation function, called Spatial-Frequency Interactive Decoder (SFID), is invented to enhance the interaction of INR features. Especially, we further theoretically prove that the Gabor wavelet activation possesses a time-frequency tightness property that favors learning the optimal bandwidths in the decoder. Experiments on two benchmark MHIF datasets verify the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of the proposed method, both visually and quantitatively. Also, ablation studies demonstrate the mentioned contributions.

Conventional super-resolution (SR) methods often struggle with thermal images due to their lack of high-frequency details. Guided SR leverages information from a high-resolution image, typically in the visible spectrum, to enhance the reconstruction of a high-res IR image from the low-res input. Inspired by SwinFusion, we propose SwinFuSR, a guided SR architecture based on Swin transformers. In real world scenarios, however, the guiding modality (e.g. RBG image) may be missing, so we propose a training method that improves the robustness of the model in this case.

Departing from conventional methods, we introduce a 3D multi-frame perspective to generate stabilized images, addressing the challenge of full-frame generation while preserving structure. The core of our approach lies in Stabilized Rendering (SR), a volume rendering module, which extends beyond the image fusion by incorporating feature fusion. The core of our RStab framework lies in Stabilized Rendering (SR), a volume rendering module, fusing multi-frame information in 3D space. Specifically, SR involves warping features and colors from multiple frames by projection, fusing them into descriptors to render the stabilized image. However, the precision of warped information depends on the projection accuracy, a factor significantly influenced by dynamic regions. In response, we introduce the Adaptive Ray Range (ARR) module to integrate depth priors, adaptively defining the sampling range for the projection process. Additionally, we propose Color Correction (CC) assisting geometric constraints with optical flow for accurate color aggregation. Thanks to the three modules, our RStab demonstrates superior performance compared with previous stabilizers in the field of view (FOV), image quality, and video stability across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> | None |

The standard modeling rules within these promising pan-sharpening methods are to roughly stack the transformer variants in a cascaded manner. Despite the remarkable advancement, their success may be at the huge cost of model parameters and FLOPs, thus preventing its application over low-resource satellites.To address this challenge between favorable performance and expensive computation, we tailor an efficient linearly-evolved transformer variant and employ it to construct a lightweight pan-sharpening framework. In detail, we deepen into the popular cascaded transformer modeling with cutting-edge methods and develop the alternative 1-order linearly-evolved transformer variant with the 1-dimensional linear convolution chain to achieve the same function. In this way, our proposed method is capable of benefiting the cascaded modeling rule while achieving favorable performance in the efficient manner. Extensive experiments over multiple satellite datasets suggest that our proposed method achieves competitive performance against other state-of-the-art with fewer computational resources. Further, the consistently favorable performance has been verified over the hyper-spectral image fusion task.

To solve this otherwise ill-posed inverse retrieval problem, we introduce statistically informed priors that encode local and global dependencies between the two single-sample measurements. This bypasses the risk of out-of-distribution hallucination as in traditional data-driven approaches and delivers enhanced images compared for example to standard bilinear interpolation.

Recently, integrating video foundation models with large language models to build a comprehensive video understanding system has been proposed to overcome the limitations of specific pre-defined vision tasks. However, the current advancements in Video LLMs tend to overlook the foundational contributions of Image LLMs, often opting for more complicated structures and a wide variety of multimodal data for pre-training. This approach significantly increases the costs associated with these methods.In response to these challenges, this work introduces an efficient method that strategically leverages the priors of Image LLMs, facilitating a resource-efficient transition from Image to Video LLMs. We propose RED-VILLM, a Resource-Efficient Development pipeline for Video LLMs from Image LLMs, which utilizes a temporal adaptation plug-and-play structure within the image fusion module of Image LLMs. This adaptation extends their understanding capabilities to include temporal information, enabling the development of Video LLMs that not only surpass baseline performances but also do so with minimal instructional data and training resources.

Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have been gradually applied to visual tasks, enhancing controllable image generation through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). In this paper, we introduce a spatial-spectral integrated diffusion model for the remote sensing pansharpening task, called SSDiff, which considers the pansharpening process as the fusion process of spatial and spectral components from the perspective of subspace decomposition. Specifically, SSDiff utilizes spatial and spectral branches to learn spatial details and spectral features separately, then employs a designed alternating projection fusion module (APFM) to accomplish the fusion. Furthermore, we propose a frequency modulation inter-branch module (FMIM) to modulate the frequency distribution between branches. The two components of SSDiff can perform favorably against the APFM when utilizing a LoRA-like branch-wise alternative fine-tuning method. It refines SSDiff to capture component-discriminating features more sufficiently. Finally, extensive experiments on four commonly used datasets, i.e., WorldView-3, WorldView-2, GaoFen-2, and QuickBird, demonstrate the superiority of SSDiff both visually and quantitatively.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in MMIF tasks due to advances in deep neural networks. However, existing methods cannot effectively and efficiently extract modality-specific and modality-fused features constrained by the inherent local reductive bias (CNN) or quadratic computational complexity (Transformers). To overcome this issue, we propose a Mamba-based Dual-phase Fusion (MambaDFuse) model. Firstly, a dual-level feature extractor is designed to capture long-range features from single-modality images by extracting low and high-level features from CNN and Mamba blocks. Then, a dual-phase feature fusion module is proposed to obtain fusion features that combine complementary information from different modalities. It uses the channel exchange method for shallow fusion and the enhanced Multi-modal Mamba (M3) blocks for deep fusion. Finally, the fused image reconstruction module utilizes the inverse transformation of the feature extraction to generate the fused result. Through extensive experiments, our approach achieves promising fusion results in infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion. Additionally, in a unified benchmark, MambaDFuse has also demonstrated improved performance in downstream tasks such as object detection.

Since images captured by different sensors vary significantly in both geometric and radiometric appearance, existing methods may fail to match corresponding regions containing the same content. Besides, most of existing datasets have not been categorized based on the characteristics of different scenes. To encourage the design of more general multi-modal image matching methods, we introduce a large-scale Multi-sources,Multi-resolutions, and Multi-scenes dataset for Optical-SAR image matching(3MOS).

Existing fusion methods are typically helpless in dealing with degradations in low-quality source images and non-interactive to multiple subjective and objective needs. To solve them, we introduce a novel approach that leverages semantic text guidance image fusion model for degradation-aware and interactive image fusion task, termed as Text-IF. It innovatively extends the classical image fusion to the text guided image fusion along with the ability to harmoniously address the degradation and interaction issues during fusion. Through the text semantic encoder and semantic interaction fusion decoder, Text-IF is accessible to the all-in-one infrared and visible image degradation-aware processing and the interactive flexible fusion outcomes.

| **[Dual-modal Prior Semantic Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion for Intelligent Transportation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16227v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) plays an important role in intelligent transportation system (ITS). The early works predominantly focus on boosting the visual appeal of the fused result, and only several recent approaches have tried to combine the high-level vision task with IVF. However, they prioritize the design of cascaded structure to seek unified suitable features and fit different tasks. Thus, they tend to typically bias toward to reconstructing raw pixels without considering the significance of semantic features. Therefore, we propose a novel prior semantic guided image fusion method based on the dual-modality strategy, improving the performance of IVF in ITS. Specifically, to explore the independent significant semantic of each modality, we first design two parallel semantic segmentation branches with a refined feature adaptive-modulation (RFaM) mechanism. RFaM can perceive the features that are semantically distinct enough in each semantic segmentation branch. Then, two pilot experiments based on the two branches are conducted to capture the significant prior semantic of two images, which then is applied to guide the fusion task in the integration of semantic segmentation branches and fusion branches. In addition, to aggregate both high-level semantics and impressive visual effects, we further investigate the frequency response of the prior semantics, and propose a multi-level representation-adaptive fusion (MRaF) module to explicitly integrate the low-frequent prior semantic with the high-frequent details. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art image fusion approaches, in terms of either the visual appeal or the high-level semantics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Task-Customized Mixture of Adapters for General Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12494v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General image fusion aims at integrating important information from multi-source images. However, due to the significant cross-task gap, the respective fusion mechanism varies considerably in practice, resulting in limited performance across subtasks. To handle this problem, we propose a novel task-customized mixture of adapters (TC-MoA) for general image fusion, adaptively prompting various fusion tasks in a unified model. We borrow the insight from the mixture of experts (MoE), taking the experts as efficient tuning adapters to prompt a pre-trained foundation model. These adapters are shared across different tasks and constrained by mutual information regularization, ensuring compatibility with different tasks while complementarity for multi-source images. The task-specific routing networks customize these adapters to extract task-specific information from different sources with dynamic dominant intensity, performing adaptive visual feature prompt fusion. Notably, our TC-MoA controls the dominant intensity bias for different fusion tasks, successfully unifying multiple fusion tasks in a single model. Extensive experiments show that TC-MoA outperforms the competing approaches in learning commonalities while retaining compatibility for general image fusion (multi-modal, multi-exposure, and multi-focus), and also demonstrating striking controllability on more generalization experiments.

In prior radar-image fusion work, image features are merged with the uncertain sparse depths measured by radar through convolutional layers. This approach is disturbed by the features computed with the uncertain radar depths. Furthermore, since the features are computed with a fully convolutional network, the uncertainty of each depth corresponding to a pixel is spread out over its surrounding pixels. Our method avoids this problem by computing features only with an image and conditioning the features pixelwise with the radar depth. Furthermore, the set of possibly correct radar directions is identified with reliable LiDAR measurements, which are available only in the training stage. Our method improves training data by learning only these possibly correct radar directions, while the previous method trains raw radar measurements, including erroneous measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can improve the quantitative and qualitative results compared with its base method using radar-image fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2024 (International Joint Conference on Neural Networks)</p></details> | None |

In recent years, some learning-based fully differentiable methods have produced beneficial outcomes while the process of feature extraction and gradient flow transmission still lack controllability and interpretability. To alleviate these problems, in this work, we propose a novel fully differentiable correlation-driven network using a dual-branch CNN-transformer encoder which enables the network to extract and separate low-frequency global features from high-frequency local features. A correlation-driven loss is further proposed for low-frequency feature and high-frequency feature decomposition based on embedded information. Besides, a training strategy that learns to approximate a convex-shape similarity function is applied in our work. We test our approach on a in-house datasetand show that it outperforms both existing fully differentiable learning-based registration approaches and the conventional optimization-based baseline.</p></details> | ISBI 2024 | None |

With the development of the RGBT (RGB & Thermal) sensor, the problem of visible (RGB) to Near Infrared (NIR) image fusion has become particularly timely. Indeed, while visible images see color, but suffer from noise, haze, and clouds, the NIR channel captures a clearer picture. The proposed approach fuses these two channels by training a Convolutional Neural Network by Self Supervised Learning (SSL) on a single example. For each such pair, RGB and NIR, the network is trained for seconds to deduce the final fusion. The SSL is based on the comparison of the Structure of Similarity and Edge-Preservation losses, where the labels for the SSL are the input channels themselves. This fusion preserves the relevant detail of each spectral channel without relying on a heavy training process. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves similar or better qualitative and quantitative multispectral fusion results than other state-of-the-art methods that do not rely on heavy training and/or large datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

While learning-based methods have shown success in generating local semantic terrain maps directly from sensor data, their efficacy in off-road environments is hindered by challenges in accurately representing uncertain terrain features. This paper presents a learning-based fusion method for generating dense terrain classification maps in BEV. By performing LiDAR-image fusion at multiple scales, our approach enhances the accuracy of semantic maps generated from an RGB image and a single-sweep LiDAR scan. Utilizing uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels further enhances the network's ability to learn reliably in off-road environments without requiring precise 3D annotations. By conducting thorough experiments using off-road driving datasets, we demonstrate that our method can improve accuracy in off-road terrains, validating its efficacy in facilitating reliable and safe autonomous navigation in challenging off-road settings.</p></details> |  | None |

The system eliminates the need for external physical markers and complex training, making image fusion feasible for physicians with different experience levels. The integrated system involves a portable 3D camera for patient-specific surface acquisition, an electromagnetic tracking system, and US components. The fusion algorithm comprises two main parts: skin segmentation and rigid co-registration, both integrated into the US machine. The co-registration software aligns the surface extracted from CT/MR images with patient-specific coordinates, facilitating rapid and effective fusion. Experimental testing in different settings validates the system's accuracy, computational efficiency, noise robustness, and operator independence.

| **[Influence of Camera-LiDAR Configuration on 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05245v2)** | 2024-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cameras and LiDARs are both important sensors for autonomous driving, playing critical roles in 3D object detection. Camera-LiDAR Fusion has been a prevalent solution for robust and accurate driving perception. In contrast to the vast majority of existing arts that focus on how to improve the performance of 3D target detection through cross-modal schemes, deep learning algorithms, and training tricks, we devote attention to the impact of sensor configurations on the performance of learning-based methods. To achieve this, we propose a unified information-theoretic surrogate metric for camera and LiDAR evaluation based on the proposed sensor perception model. We also design an accelerated high-quality framework for data acquisition, model training, and performance evaluation that functions with the CARLA simulator. To show the correlation between detection performance and our surrogate metrics, We conduct experiments using several camera-LiDAR placements and parameters inspired by self-driving companies and research institutions. Extensive experimental results of representative algorithms on nuScenes dataset validate the effectiveness of our surrogate metric, demonstrating that sensor configurations significantly impact point-cloud-image fusion based detection models, which contribute up to 30% discrepancy in terms of the average precision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal and multicontrast image fusion via deep generative models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15963v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, it has become progressively more evident that classic diagnostic labels are unable to reliably describe the complexity and variability of several clinical phenotypes. This is particularly true for a broad range of neuropsychiatric illnesses (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, behavioral phenotypes). Patient heterogeneity can be better described by grouping individuals into novel categories based on empirically derived sections of intersecting continua that span across and beyond traditional categorical borders. In this context, neuroimaging data carry a wealth of spatiotemporally resolved information about each patient's brain. However, they are usually heavily collapsed a priori through procedures which are not learned as part of model training, and consequently not optimized for the downstream prediction task. This is because every individual participant usually comes with multiple whole-brain 3D imaging modalities often accompanied by a deep genotypic and phenotypic characterization, hence posing formidable computational challenges. In this paper we design a deep learning architecture based on generative models rooted in a modular approach and separable convolutional blocks to a) fuse multiple 3D neuroimaging modalities on a voxel-wise level, b) convert them into informative latent embeddings through heavy dimensionality reduction, c) maintain good generalizability and minimal information loss. As proof of concept, we test our architecture on the well characterized Human Connectome Project database demonstrating that our latent embeddings can be clustered into easily separable subject strata which, in turn, map to different phenotypical information which was not included in the embedding creation process. This may be of aid in predicting disease evolution as well as drug response, hence supporting mechanistic disease understanding and empowering clinical trials.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Infrared and visible Image Fusion with Language-driven Loss in CLIP Embedding Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16267v1)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) has attracted much attention owing to the highly-complementary properties of the two image modalities. Due to the lack of ground-truth fused images, the fusion output of current deep-learning based methods heavily depends on the loss functions defined mathematically. As it is hard to well mathematically define the fused image without ground truth, the performance of existing fusion methods is limited. In this paper, we first propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors to represent the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training. Experiments show that our method can obtain much better fusion results than existing techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

By raster-scanning the retina, sequential cross-sectional image slices are acquired to generate volumetric data. In-vivo imaging suffers from discontinuities between slices that show up as motion and illumination artifacts. We present a new illumination model that exploits continuity in orthogonally raster-scanned volume data. Our novel spatiotemporal parametrization adheres to illumination continuity both temporally, along the imaged slices, as well as spatially, in the transverse directions. Yet, our formulation does not make inter-slice assumptions, which could have discontinuities. This is the first optimization of a 3D inverse model in an image reconstruction context in OCT. Evaluation in 68 volumes from eyes with pathology showed reduction of illumination artifacts in 88\% of the data, and only 6\% showed moderate residual illumination artifacts. The method enables the use of forward-warped motion corrected data, which is more accurate, and enables supersampling and advanced 3D image reconstruction in OCT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented orally & as poster on 20th April 2023 at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) in Cartagena, Colombia. 6 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Point cloud-based registration and image fusion between cardiac SPECT MPI and CTA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06841v1)** | 2024-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A method was proposed for the point cloud-based registration and image fusion between cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion images (MPI) and cardiac computed tomography angiograms (CTA). Firstly, the left ventricle (LV) epicardial regions (LVERs) in SPECT and CTA images were segmented by using different U-Net neural networks trained to generate the point clouds of the LV epicardial contours (LVECs). Secondly, according to the characteristics of cardiac anatomy, the special points of anterior and posterior interventricular grooves (APIGs) were manually marked in both SPECT and CTA image volumes. Thirdly, we developed an in-house program for coarsely registering the special points of APIGs to ensure a correct cardiac orientation alignment between SPECT and CTA images. Fourthly, we employed ICP, SICP or CPD algorithm to achieve a fine registration for the point clouds (together with the special points of APIGs) of the LV epicardial surfaces (LVERs) in SPECT and CTA images. Finally, the image fusion between SPECT and CTA was realized after the fine registration. The experimental results showed that the cardiac orientation was aligned well and the mean distance error of the optimal registration method (CPD with affine transform) was consistently less than 3 mm. The proposed method could effectively fuse the structures from cardiac CTA and SPECT functional images, and demonstrated a potential in assisting in accurate diagnosis of cardiac diseases by combining complementary advantages of the two imaging modalities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FusionBooster: A Unified Image Fusion Boosting Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05970v3)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous ideas have emerged for designing a mutually reinforcing mechanism or extra stages for the image fusion task, ignoring the inevitable gaps between different vision tasks and the computational burden. We argue that there is a scope to improve the fusion performance with the help of the FusionBooster, a model specifically designed for the fusion task. In particular, our booster is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy controlled by an information probe. The booster is composed of three building blocks: the probe units, the booster layer, and the assembling module. Given the result produced by a backbone method, the probe units assess the fused image and divide the results according to their information content. This is instrumental in identifying missing information, as a step to its recovery. The recovery of the degraded components along with the fusion guidance are the role of the booster layer. Lastly, the assembling module is responsible for piecing these advanced components together to deliver the output. We use concise reconstruction loss functions in conjunction with lightweight autoencoder models to formulate the learning task, with marginal computational complexity increase. The experimental results obtained in various fusion tasks, as well as downstream detection tasks, consistently demonstrate that the proposed FusionBooster significantly improves the performance.

However, the difference in the source-specific manifestation of the imaged scene content makes it difficult to design a robust and controllable fusion process. We argue that this issue can be alleviated with the help of higher-level semantics, conveyed by the text modality, which should enable us to generate fused images for different purposes, such as visualisation and downstream tasks, in a controllable way. This is achieved by exploiting a vision-and-language model to build a coarse-to-fine association mechanism between the text and image signals. With the guidance of the association maps, an affine fusion unit is embedded in the transformer network to fuse the text and vision modalities at the feature level. As another ingredient of this work, we propose the use of textual attention to adapt image quality assessment to the fusion task. To facilitate the implementation of the proposed text-guided fusion paradigm, and its adoption by the wider research community, we release a text-annotated image fusion dataset IVT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach (TextFusion) consistently outperforms traditional appearance-based fusion methods.

Preoperative 3D models extracted from CT or MRI data are registered to the intraoperative laparoscopic images during this process. In terms of 3D-2D fusion, most of the algorithms make use of anatomical landmarks to guide registration. These landmarks include the liver's inferior ridge, the falciform ligament, and the occluding contours. They are usually marked by hand in both the laparoscopic image and the 3D model, which is time-consuming and may contain errors if done by a non-experienced user. Therefore, there is a need to automate this process so that augmented reality can be used effectively in the operating room. We present the Preoperative-to-Intraoperative Laparoscopic Fusion Challenge (P2ILF), held during the Medical Imaging and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI 2022) conference, which investigates the possibilities of detecting these landmarks automatically and using them in registration. The challenge was divided into two tasks: 1) A 2D and 3D landmark detection task and 2) a 3D-2D registration task. The teams were provided with training data consisting of 167 laparoscopic images and 9 preoperative 3D models from 9 patients, with the corresponding 2D and 3D landmark annotations. A total of 6 teams from 4 countries participated, whose proposed methods were evaluated on 16 images and two preoperative 3D models from two patients. All the teams proposed deep learning-based methods for the 2D and 3D landmark segmentation tasks and differentiable rendering-based methods for the registration task. Based on the experimental outcomes, we propose three key hypotheses that determine current limitations and future directions for research in this domain.</p></details> | 24 pages | None |
| **[Physics-Inspired Degradation Models for Hyperspectral Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02411v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fusion of a low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-spatial-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) has garnered increasing research interest. However, most fusion methods solely focus on the fusion algorithm itself and overlook the degradation models, which results in unsatisfactory performance in practical scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose physics-inspired degradation models (PIDM) to model the degradation of LR-HSI and HR-MSI, which comprises a spatial degradation network (SpaDN) and a spectral degradation network (SpeDN). SpaDN and SpeDN are designed based on two insights. First, we employ spatial warping and spectral modulation operations to simulate lens aberrations, thereby introducing non-uniformity into the spatial and spectral degradation processes. Second, we utilize asymmetric downsampling and parallel downsampling operations to separately reduce the spatial and spectral resolutions of the images, thus ensuring the matching of spatial and spectral degradation processes with specific physical characteristics. Once SpaDN and SpeDN are established, we adopt a self-supervised training strategy to optimize the network parameters and provide a plug-and-play solution for fusion methods. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PIDM can boost the fusion performance of existing fusion methods in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, little attention has been paid on complex scenes fusion, causing existing techniques to produce sub-optimal results when suffers from real interferences. To fill this gap, we propose a decomposition-based and interference perception image fusion method. Specifically, we classify the pixels of visible image from the degree of scattering of light transmission, based on which we then separate the detail and energy information of the image. This refined decomposition facilitates the proposed model in identifying more interfering pixels that are in complex scenes. To strike a balance between denoising and detail preservation, we propose an adaptive denoising scheme for fusing detail components. Meanwhile, we propose a new weighted fusion rule by considering the distribution of image energy information from the perspective of multiple directions. Extensive experiments in complex scenes fusions cover adverse weathers, noise, blur, overexposure, fire, as well as downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, object detection, salient object detection and depth estimation, consistently indicate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared with the recent representative methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods primarily focus on enhancing image fusion with a single advanced task such as incorporating semantic or object-related information into the fusion process. This method creates challenges in achieving multiple objectives simultaneously. We introduce a target and semantic awareness joint-driven fusion network called TSJNet. TSJNet comprises fusion, detection, and segmentation subnetworks arranged in a series structure. It leverages object and semantically relevant information derived from dual high-level tasks to guide the fusion network. Additionally, We propose a local significant feature extraction module with a double parallel branch structure to fully capture the fine-grained features of cross-modal images and foster interaction among modalities, targets, and segmentation information. We conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (MSRS, M3FD, RoadScene, and LLVIP). The results demonstrate that TSJNet can generate visually pleasing fused results, achieving an average increase of 2.84% and 7.47% in object detection and segmentation mAP @0.5 and mIoU, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, this study proposes a new small-area-aware MFIF algorithm for enhancing object detection capability. First, we enhance the pixel attributes within the small focus and boundary regions, which are subsequently combined with visual saliency detection to obtain the pre-fusion results used to discriminate the distribution of focused pixels. To accurately ensure pixel focus, we consider the source image as a combination of focused, defocused, and uncertain regions and propose a three-region segmentation strategy. Finally, we design an effective pixel selection rule to generate segmentation decision maps and obtain the final fusion results. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately detect small and smooth focus areas while improving object detection performance, outperforming existing methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

However, the fusion of multiple visible images with different focal regions and infrared images is a unprecedented challenge in real MMIF applications. This is because of the limited depth of the focus of visible optical lenses, which impedes the simultaneous capture of the focal information within the same scene. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a MMIF framework for joint focused integration and modalities information extraction. Specifically, a semi-sparsity-based smoothing filter is introduced to decompose the images into structure and texture components. Subsequently, a novel multi-scale operator is proposed to fuse the texture components, capable of detecting significant information by considering the pixel focus attributes and relevant data from various modal images. Additionally, to achieve an effective capture of scene luminance and reasonable contrast maintenance, we consider the distribution of energy information in the structural components in terms of multi-directional frequency variance and information entropy. Extensive experiments on existing MMIF datasets, as well as the object detection and depth estimation tasks, consistently demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can surpass the state-of-the-art methods in visual perception and quantitative evaluation.

Many characteristics of the V-L model have been explored in existing research including the challenge of the sensitivity to text input and the tuning process across multi-modal prompts. With the advanced utilization of the V-L model like CLIP, recent approaches deploy learnable prompts instead of hand-craft prompts to boost the generalization performance and address the aforementioned challenges. Inspired by layer-wise training, which is wildly used in image fusion, we note that using a sequential training process to adapt different modalities branches of CLIP efficiently facilitates the improvement of generalization. In the context of addressing the multi-modal prompting challenge, we propose Token-wise Adaptive for Multi-modal Prompt Learning (APLe) for tuning both modalities prompts, vision and language, as tokens in a sequential manner. APLe addresses the challenges in V-L models to promote prompt learning across both modalities, which indicates a competitive generalization performance in line with the state-of-the-art. Preeminently, APLe shows robustness and favourable performance in prompt-length experiments with an absolute advantage in adopting the V-L models.</p></details> | 7 pages,3 figures | None |

It greatly facilitates downstream applications such as pan-sharpening, change detection, land-cover classification, etc. Yet, image fusion solutions are highly disparate to various remote sensing problems and thus are often narrowly defined in existing reviews as topical applications, such as pan-sharpening, and spatial-temporal image fusion. Considering that image fusion can be theoretically applied to any gridded data through pixel-level operations, in this paper, we expanded its scope by comprehensively surveying relevant works with a simple taxonomy: 1) many-to-one image fusion; 2) many-to-many image fusion. This simple taxonomy defines image fusion as a mapping problem that turns either a single or a set of images into another single or set of images, depending on the desired coherence, e.g., spectral, spatial/resolution coherence, etc. We show that this simple taxonomy, despite the significant modality difference it covers, can be presented by a conceptually easy framework. In addition, we provide a meta-analysis to review the major papers studying the various types of image fusion and their applications over the years (from the 1980s to date), covering 5,926 peer-reviewed papers. Finally, we discuss the main benefits and emerging challenges to provide open research directions and potential future works.</p></details> | 21pages, 10 figures | None |

By thoroughly examining pedestrian detection techniques in low-light conditions, this survey seeks to contribute to the advancement of safer and more reliable autonomous driving systems and other applications related to pedestrian safety. Accordingly, most of the current approaches in the field use deep learning-based image fusion methodologies (i.e., early, halfway, and late fusion) for accurate and reliable pedestrian detection. Moreover, the majority of the works in the field (approximately 48%) have been evaluated on the KAIST dataset, while the real-world video feeds recorded by authors have been used in less than six percent of the works.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 3 tables, 10 figures</p></details> | None |

Despite its popularity, the inherent disparities in how different sources depict scene content make fusion a challenging problem. Current fusion methodologies identify shared characteristics between the two modalities and integrate them within this shared domain using either iterative optimization or deep learning architectures, which often neglect the intricate semantic relationships between modalities, resulting in a superficial understanding of inter-modal connections and, consequently, suboptimal fusion outcomes. To address this, we introduce a text-guided multi-modality image fusion method that leverages the high-level semantics from textual descriptions to integrate semantics from infrared and visible images. This method capitalizes on the complementary characteristics of diverse modalities, bolstering both the accuracy and robustness of object detection. The codebook is utilized to enhance a streamlined and concise depiction of the fused intra- and inter-domain dynamics, fine-tuned for optimal performance in detection tasks. We present a bilevel optimization strategy that establishes a nexus between the joint problem of fusion and detection, optimizing both processes concurrently. Furthermore, we introduce the first dataset of paired infrared and visible images accompanied by text prompts, paving the way for future research. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method not only produces visually superior fusion results but also achieves a higher detection mAP over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> | None |

Yet, existing image fusion algorithms rely heavily on strictly registered input image pairs to produce more precise fusion results, as a way to improve the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. In order to relax this assumption, one can attempt to register images first. However, the existing methods for registering multiple modalities have limitations, such as complex structures and reliance on significant semantic information. This paper aims to address the problem of image registration and fusion in a single framework, called BusRef. We focus on Infrared-Visible image registration and fusion task (IVRF). In this framework, the input unaligned image pairs will pass through three stages: Coarse registration, Fine registration and Fusion. It will be shown that the unified approach enables more robust IVRF. We also propose a novel training and evaluation strategy, involving the use of masks to reduce the influence of non-reconstructible regions on the loss functions, which greatly improves the accuracy and robustness of the fusion task. Last but not least, a gradient-aware fusion network is designed to preserve the complementary information. The advanced performance of this algorithm is demonstrated by</p></details> |  | None |

This makes the integration of event cameras into middle- and high-level RGB-based vision tasks highly promising. However, challenges arise in multi-modal fusion, data annotation, and model architecture design. In this paper, we propose EvPlug, which learns a plug-and-play event and image fusion module from the supervision of the existing RGB-based model. The learned fusion module integrates event streams with image features in the form of a plug-in, endowing the RGB-based model to be robust to HDR and fast motion scenes while enabling high temporal resolution inference. Our method only requires unlabeled event-image pairs (no pixel-wise alignment required) and does not alter the structure or weights of the RGB-based model. We demonstrate the superiority of EvPlug in several vision tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D hand pose estimation</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SSPFusion: A Semantic Structure-Preserving Approach for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14745v2)** | 2023-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing learning-based infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) methods exhibit massive redundant information in the fusion images, i.e., yielding edge-blurring effect or unrecognizable for object detectors. To alleviate these issues, we propose a semantic structure-preserving approach for IVIF, namely SSPFusion. At first, we design a Structural Feature Extractor (SFE) to extract the structural features of infrared and visible images. Then, we introduce a multi-scale Structure-Preserving Fusion (SPF) module to fuse the structural features of infrared and visible images, while maintaining the consistency of semantic structures between the fusion and source images. Owing to these two effective modules, our method is able to generate high-quality fusion images from pairs of infrared and visible images, which can boost the performance of downstream computer-vision tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms eight state-of-the-art image fusion methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code for our method, along with additional comparison results, will be made available at: https://github.com/QiaoYang-CV/SSPFUSION.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/QiaoYang-CV/SSPFUSION) |

While decomposing all of these effects from a stack of misaligned images is a highly ill-conditioned task, the conventional align-and-merge burst pipeline takes the other extreme: blending them into a single image. In this work, we propose a versatile intermediate representation: a two-layer alpha-composited image plus flow model constructed with neural spline fields -- networks trained to map input coordinates to spline control points. Our method is able to, during test-time optimization, jointly fuse a burst image capture into one high-resolution reconstruction and decompose it into transmission and obstruction layers. Then, by discarding the obstruction layer, we can perform a range of tasks including seeing through occlusions, reflection suppression, and shadow removal. Validated on complex synthetic and in-the-wild captures we find that, with no post-processing steps or learned priors, our generalizable model is able to outperform existing dedicated single-image and multi-view obstruction removal approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://light.princeton.edu/publication/nsf</p></details> | None |
| **[Hierarchical Open-vocabulary Universal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00764v2)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary image segmentation aims to partition an image into semantic regions according to arbitrary text descriptions. However, complex visual scenes can be naturally decomposed into simpler parts and abstracted at multiple levels of granularity, introducing inherent segmentation ambiguity. Unlike existing methods that typically sidestep this ambiguity and treat it as an external factor, our approach actively incorporates a hierarchical representation encompassing different semantic-levels into the learning process. We propose a decoupled text-image fusion mechanism and representation learning modules for both "things" and "stuff". Additionally, we systematically examine the differences that exist in the textual and visual features between these types of categories. Our resulting model, named HIPIE, tackles HIerarchical, oPen-vocabulary, and unIvErsal segmentation tasks within a unified framework. Benchmarked on over 40 datasets, e.g., ADE20K, COCO, Pascal-VOC Part, RefCOCO/RefCOCOg, ODinW and SeginW, HIPIE achieves the state-of-the-art results at various levels of image comprehension, including semantic-level (e.g., semantic segmentation), instance-level (e.g., panoptic/referring segmentation and object detection), as well as part-level (e.g., part/subpart segmentation) tasks.

Image fusion, employing Bayesian fusion, merges SAR texture bands with VNIR-SWIR imageries. The research aims to investigate the impact of this fusion on LULC classification. Despite the popularity of random forests for supervised classification, their limitations, such as suboptimal performance with fewer features and accuracy stagnation, are addressed. To overcome these issues, ensembles of random forests (RFE) are created, introducing random rotations using the Forest-RC algorithm. Three rotation approaches: principal component analysis (PCA), sparse random rotation (SRP) matrix, and complete random rotation (CRP) matrix are employed. Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 VNIR-SWIR data from the IIT-Kanpur region constitute the training datasets, including SAR, SAR with texture, VNIR-SWIR, VNIR-SWIR with texture, and fused VNIR-SWIR with texture. The study evaluates classifier efficacy, explores the impact of SAR and VNIR-SWIR fusion on classification, and significantly enhances the execution speed of Bayesian fusion code. The SRP-based RFE outperforms other ensembles for the first two datasets, yielding average overall kappa values of 61.80% and 68.18%, while the CRP-based RFE excels for the last three datasets with average overall kappa values of 95.99%, 96.93%, and 96.30%. The fourth dataset achieves the highest overall kappa of 96.93%. Furthermore, incorporating texture with SAR bands results in a maximum overall kappa increment of 10.00%, while adding texture to VNIR-SWIR bands yields a maximum increment of approximately 3.45%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Thesi...</summary><p>Thesis for Master of Technology.

In the overlap region, fusing the $\bf{W}$ and $\bf{T}$ images can generate a higher quality image. Related works perform pixel-level motion alignment or high-dimensional feature alignment of the $\bf{T}$ image to the view of the $\bf{W}$ image and then perform image/feature fusion, but the enhancement in occlusion area is ill-posed and can hardly utilize data from $\bf{T}$ images. Our insight is to minimize the occlusion area and thus maximize the use of pixels from $\bf{T}$ images. Instead of insisting on placing the output in the $\bf{W}$ view, we propose a view transition method to transform both $\bf{W}$ and $\bf{T}$ images into a mixed view and then blend them into the output. The transformation ratio is kept small and not apparent to users, and the center area of the output, which has accumulated a sufficient amount of transformation, can directly use the contents from the T view to minimize occlusions. Experimental results show that, in comparison with the SOTA methods, occlusion area is largely reduced by our method and thus more pixels of the $\bf{T}$ image can be used for improving the quality of the output image.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Dual Domain Multi-exposure Image Fusion Network based on the Spatial-Frequency Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10604v1)** | 2023-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-exposure image fusion aims to generate a single high-dynamic image by integrating images with different exposures. Existing deep learning-based multi-exposure image fusion methods primarily focus on spatial domain fusion, neglecting the global modeling ability of the frequency domain. To effectively leverage the global illumination modeling ability of the frequency domain, we propose a novelty perspective on multi-exposure image fusion via the Spatial-Frequency Integration Framework, named MEF-SFI. Initially, we revisit the properties of the Fourier transform on the 2D image, and verify the feasibility of multi-exposure image fusion on the frequency domain where the amplitude and phase component is able to guide the integration of the illumination information. Subsequently, we present the deep Fourier-based multi-exposure image fusion framework, which consists of a spatial path and frequency path for local and global modeling separately. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block to facilitate efficient interaction between dual domains and capture complementary information from input images with different exposures. Finally, we combine a dual domain loss function to ensure the retention of complementary information in both the spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on the PQA-MEF dataset demonstrate that our method achieves visual-appealing fusion results against state-of-the-art multi-exposure image fusion approaches.

Different spectral capturing setups, e.g., based on filter-wheel, push-broom, line-scanning, or mosaic cameras, have been introduced in the last years to support a wide range of applications in agriculture, medicine, and industrial surveillance. However, these systems often suffer from different disadvantages, such as lack of real-time capability, limited spectral coverage or low spatial resolution. To address these drawbacks, we present a novel approach combining two calibrated multispectral real-time capable snapshot cameras, covering different spectral ranges, into a stereo-system. Therefore, a hyperspectral data-cube can be continuously captured. The combined use of different multispectral snapshot cameras enables both 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis. Both captured images are demosaicked avoiding spatial resolution loss. We fuse the spectral data from one camera into the other to receive a spatially and spectrally high resolution video stream. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and the system is investigated with regard to its applicability for surgical assistance monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>VISAP...</summary><p>VISAPP 2024 - 19th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications</p></details> | None |
| **[Partition-based K-space Synthesis for Multi-contrast Parallel Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00387v1)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging is a significant and essential medical imaging technique.However, multi-contrast imaging has longer acquisition time and is easy to cause motion artifacts. In particular, the acquisition time for a T2-weighted image is prolonged due to its longer repetition time (TR). On the contrary, T1-weighted image has a shorter TR. Therefore,utilizing complementary information across T1 and T2-weighted image is a way to decrease the overall imaging time. Previous T1-assisted T2 reconstruction methods have mostly focused on image domain using whole-based image fusion approaches. The image domain reconstruction method has the defects of high computational complexity and limited flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-contrast imaging method called partition-based k-space synthesis (PKS) which can achieve super reconstruction quality of T2-weighted image by feature fusion. Concretely, we first decompose fully-sampled T1 k-space data and under-sampled T2 k-space data into two sub-data, separately. Then two new objects are constructed by combining the two sub-T1/T2 data. After that, the two new objects as the whole data to realize the reconstruction of T2-weighted image. Finally, the objective T2 is synthesized by extracting the sub-T2 data of each part. Experimental results showed that our combined technique can achieve comparable or better results than using traditional k-space parallel imaging(SAKE) that processes each contrast independently.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Real-World Focus Stacking with Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17846v1)** | 2023-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Focus stacking is widely used in micro, macro, and landscape photography to reconstruct all-in-focus images from multiple frames obtained with focus bracketing, that is, with shallow depth of field and different focus planes. Existing deep learning approaches to the underlying multi-focus image fusion problem have limited applicability to real-world imagery since they are designed for very short image sequences (two to four images), and are typically trained on small, low-resolution datasets either acquired by light-field cameras or generated synthetically. We introduce a new dataset consisting of 94 high-resolution bursts of raw images with focus bracketing, with pseudo ground truth computed from the data using state-of-the-art commercial software. This dataset is used to train the first deep learning algorithm for focus stacking capable of handling bursts of sufficient length for real-world applications. Qualitative experiments demonstrate that it is on par with existing commercial solutions in the long-burst, realistic regime while being significantly more tolerant to noise.

The traditional approach models the relevance based product titles and queries, but the information in titles alone maybe insufficient to describe the products completely. A more general optimization approach is to further leverage product image information. In recent years, vision-language pre-training models have achieved impressive results in many scenarios, which leverage contrastive learning to map both textual and visual features into a joint embedding space. In e-commerce, a common practice is to fine-tune on the pre-trained model based on e-commerce data. However, the performance is sub-optimal because the vision-language pre-training models lack of alignment specifically designed for queries. In this paper, we propose a method called Query-LIFE (Query-aware Language Image Fusion Embedding) to address these challenges. Query-LIFE utilizes a query-based multimodal fusion to effectively incorporate the image and title based on the product types. Additionally, it employs query-aware modal alignment to enhance the accuracy of the comprehensive representation of products. Furthermore, we design GenFilt, which utilizes the generation capability of large models to filter out false negative samples and further improve the overall performance of the contrastive learning task in the model. Experiments have demonstrated that Query-LIFE outperforms existing baselines. We have conducted ablation studies and human evaluations to validate the effectiveness of each module within Query-LIFE. Moreover, Query-LIFE has been deployed on Miravia Search, resulting in improved both relevance and conversion efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

To circumvent this issue, dualview imaging is helpful. It allows various sections of the specimen to be scanned ideally by viewing the sample from opposing orientations. Recent image fusion approaches can then be applied to determine in-focus pixels by comparing image qualities of two views locally and thus yield spatially inconsistent focus measures due to their limited field-of-view. Here, we propose BigFUSE, a global context-aware image fuser that stabilizes image fusion in LSFM by considering the global impact of photon propagation in the specimen while determining focus-defocus based on local image qualities. Inspired by the image formation prior in dual-view LSFM, image fusion is considered as estimating a focus-defocus boundary using Bayes Theorem, where (i) the effect of light scattering onto focus measures is included within Likelihood; and (ii) the spatial consistency regarding focus-defocus is imposed in Prior. The expectation-maximum algorithm is then adopted to estimate the focus-defocus boundary. Competitive experimental results show that BigFUSE is the first dual-view LSFM fuser that is able to exclude structured artifacts when fusing information, highlighting its abilities of automatic image fusion.</p></details> | paper in MICCAI 2023 | None |
| **[Graph Representation Learning for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00291v1)** | 2023-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion aims to extract complementary features to synthesize a single fused image. Many methods employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features due to its translation invariance and locality. However, CNNs fail to consider the image's non-local self-similarity (NLss), though it can expand the receptive field by pooling operations, it still inevitably leads to information loss. In addition, the transformer structure extracts long-range dependence by considering the correlativity among all image patches, leading to information redundancy of such transformer-based methods. However, graph representation is more flexible than grid (CNN) or sequence (transformer structure) representation to address irregular objects, and graph can also construct the relationships among the spatially repeatable details or texture with far-space distance. Therefore, to address the above issues, it is significant to convert images into the graph space and thus adopt graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract NLss. This is because the graph can provide a fine structure to aggregate features and propagate information across the nearest vertices without introducing redundant information. Concretely, we implement a cascaded NLss extraction pattern to extract NLss of intra- and inter-modal by exploring interactions of different image pixels in intra- and inter-image positional distance. We commence by preforming GCNs on each intra-modal to aggregate features and propagate information to extract independent intra-modal NLss. Then, GCNs are performed on the concatenate intra-modal NLss features of infrared and visible images, which can explore the cross-domain NLss of inter-modal to reconstruct the fused image. Ablation studies and extensive experiments illustrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method on three datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Benefiting from powerful inductive bias capability, CNN-based methods have achieved great success in the MHIF task. However, they lack certain interpretability and require convolution structures be stacked to enhance performance. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has achieved good performance and interpretability in 2D tasks due to its ability to locally interpolate samples and utilize multimodal content such as pixels and coordinates. Although INR-based approaches show promise, they require extra construction of high-frequency information (\emph{e.g.,} positional encoding). In this paper, inspired by previous work of MHIF task, we realize that HR-MSI could serve as a high-frequency detail auxiliary input, leading us to propose a novel INR-based hyperspectral fusion function named Implicit Neural Feature Fusion Function (INF). As an elaborate structure, it solves the MHIF task and addresses deficiencies in the INR-based approaches. Specifically, our INF designs a Dual High-Frequency Fusion (DHFF) structure that obtains high-frequency information twice from HR-MSI and LR-HSI, then subtly fuses them with coordinate information. Moreover, the proposed INF incorporates a parameter-free method named INR with cosine similarity (INR-CS) that uses cosine similarity to generate local weights through feature vectors. Based on INF, we construct an Implicit Neural Fusion Network (INFN) that achieves state-of-the-art performance for MHIF tasks of two public datasets, \emph{i.e.,} CAVE and Harvard.

Additionally, the lack of data for training robust models adds another limitation in effectively studying complex forest conditions. This paper presents a novel method for detecting shadowed tree crowns and provides a challenging dataset comprising roughly 50k paired RGB-thermal images to facilitate future research for illumination-invariant detection. The proposed method (ShadowSense) is entirely self-supervised, leveraging domain adversarial training without source domain annotations for feature extraction and foreground feature alignment for feature pyramid networks to adapt domain-invariant representations by focusing on visible foreground regions, respectively. It then fuses complementary information of both modalities to effectively improve upon the predictions of an RGB-trained detector and boost the overall accuracy.

The quality of the fused image depends on the extracted single modality features as well as the fusion rules for multi-modal information. Existing deep learning-based fusion methods can fully exploit the semantic features of each modality, they cannot distinguish the effective low and high frequency information of each modality and fuse them adaptively. To address this issue, we propose AdaFuse, in which multimodal image information is fused adaptively through frequency-guided attention mechanism based on Fourier transform. Specifically, we propose the cross-attention fusion (CAF) block, which adaptively fuses features of two modalities in the spatial and frequency domains by exchanging key and query values, and then calculates the cross-attention scores between the spatial and frequency features to further guide the spatial-frequential information fusion. The CAF block enhances the high-frequency features of the different modalities so that the details in the fused images can be retained. Moreover, we design a novel loss function composed of structure loss and content loss to preserve both low and high frequency information. Extensive comparison experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The ablation experiments also validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss and fusion strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, deep learning-based models have excelled the conventional fusion methods by executing feature extraction, feature selection, and feature fusion tasks, simultaneously. However, most of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures use conventional pooling or strided convolutional strategies to downsample the feature maps. It causes the blurring or loss of important diagnostic information and edge details available in the source images and dilutes the efficacy of the feature extraction process. Therefore, this paper presents an end-to-end unsupervised fusion model for multimodal medical images based on an edge-preserving dense autoencoder network. In the proposed model, feature extraction is improved by using wavelet decomposition-based attention pooling of feature maps. This helps in preserving the fine edge detail information present in both the source images and enhances the visual perception of fused images. Further, the proposed model is trained on a variety of medical image pairs which helps in capturing the intensity distributions of the source images and preserves the diagnostic information effectively. Substantial experiments are conducted which demonstrate that the proposed method provides improved visual and quantitative results as compared to the other state-of-the-art fusion methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

| **[Hyperspectral Image Fusion via Logarithmic Low-rank Tensor Ring Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10044v1)** | 2023-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating a low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-spatial-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) is recognized as a valid method for acquiring HR-HSI. Among the current fusion approaches, the tensor ring (TR) decomposition-based method has received growing attention owing to its superior performance on preserving the spatial-spectral correlation. Furthermore, the low-rank property in some TR factors has been exploited via the matrix nuclear norm regularization along mode-2. On the other hand, the tensor nuclear norm (TNN)-based approaches have recently demonstrated to be more efficient on keeping high-dimensional low-rank structures in tensor recovery. Here, we study the low-rankness of TR factors from the TNN perspective and consider the mode-2 logarithmic TNN (LTNN) on each TR factor. A novel fusion model is proposed by incorporating this LTNN regularization and the weighted total variation which is to promote the continuity of HR-HSI in the spatial-spectral domain. Meanwhile, we have devised a highly efficient proximal alternating minimization algorithm to solve the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that our method improves the visual quality and exceeds the existing state-of-the-art fusion approaches with respect to various quantitative metrics.</p></details> | 21 pages | None |
| **[Three-Dimensional Medical Image Fusion with Deformable Cross-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06291v1)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal medical image fusion plays an instrumental role in several areas of medical image processing, particularly in disease recognition and tumor detection. Traditional fusion methods tend to process each modality independently before combining the features and reconstructing the fusion image. However, this approach often neglects the fundamental commonalities and disparities between multimodal information. Furthermore, the prevailing methodologies are largely confined to fusing two-dimensional (2D) medical image slices, leading to a lack of contextual supervision in the fusion images and subsequently, a decreased information yield for physicians relative to three-dimensional (3D) images. In this study, we introduce an innovative unsupervised feature mutual learning fusion network designed to rectify these limitations. Our approach incorporates a Deformable Cross Feature Blend (DCFB) module that facilitates the dual modalities in discerning their respective similarities and differences. We have applied our model to the fusion of 3D MRI and PET images obtained from 660 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Through the application of the DCFB module, our network generates high-quality MRI-PET fusion images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses traditional 2D image fusion methods in performance metrics such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). Importantly, the capacity of our method to fuse 3D images enhances the information available to physicians and researchers, thus marking a significant step forward in the field. The code will soon be available online.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IFT: Image Fusion Transformer for Ghost-free High Dynamic Range Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15019v2)** | 2023-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-frame high dynamic range (HDR) imaging aims to reconstruct ghost-free images with photo-realistic details from content-complementary but spatially misaligned low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR algorithms are prone to producing ghosting artifacts as their methods fail to capture long-range dependencies between LDR frames with large motion in dynamic scenes. To address this issue, we propose a novel image fusion transformer, referred to as IFT, which presents a fast global patch searching (FGPS) module followed by a self-cross fusion module (SCF) for ghost-free HDR imaging. The FGPS searches the patches from supporting frames that have the closest dependency to each patch of the reference frame for long-range dependency modeling, while the SCF conducts intra-frame and inter-frame feature fusion on the patches obtained by the FGPS with linear complexity to input resolution. By matching similar patches between frames, objects with large motion ranges in dynamic scenes can be aligned, which can effectively alleviate the generation of artifacts. In addition, the proposed FGPS and SCF can be integrated into various deep HDR methods as efficient plug-in modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  | None |

Among these, there are diffusion-based models that have demonstrated essential quality enhancements. These models are generally split into two categories: pixel-level and latent-level approaches. We present Kandinsky1, a novel exploration of latent diffusion architecture, combining the principles of the image prior models with latent diffusion techniques. The image prior model is trained separately to map text embeddings to image embeddings of CLIP. Another distinct feature of the proposed model is the modified MoVQ implementation, which serves as the image autoencoder component. Overall, the designed model contains 3.3B parameters. We also deployed a user-friendly demo system that supports diverse generative modes such as text-to-image generation, image fusion, text and image fusion, image variations generation, and text-guided inpainting/outpainting. Additionally, we released the source code and checkpoints for the Kandinsky models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate a FID score of 8.03 on the COCO-30K dataset, marking our model as the top open-source performer in terms of measurable image generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

We show that the fusion weights of an exposure can be encoded into a 1D lookup table (LUT), which takes pixel intensity value as input and produces fusion weight as output. We learn one 1D LUT for each exposure, then all the pixels from different exposures can query 1D LUT of that exposure independently for high-quality and efficient fusion. Specifically, to learn these 1D LUTs, we involve attention mechanism in various dimensions including frame, channel and spatial ones into the MEF task so as to bring us significant quality improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA). In addition, we collect a new MEF dataset consisting of 960 samples, 155 of which are manually tuned by professionals as ground-truth for evaluation. Our network is trained by this dataset in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the newly proposed components, and results show that our approach outperforms the SOTA in our and another representative dataset SICE, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, our 1D LUT approach takes less than 4ms to run a 4K image on a PC GPU.

| **[Visible and NIR Image Fusion Algorithm Based on Information Complementarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10522v1)** | 2023-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible and near-infrared(NIR) band sensors provide images that capture complementary spectral radiations from a scene. And the fusion of the visible and NIR image aims at utilizing their spectrum properties to enhance image quality. However, currently visible and NIR fusion algorithms cannot well take advantage of spectrum properties, as well as lack information complementarity, which results in color distortion and artifacts. Therefore, this paper designs a complementary fusion model from the level of physical signals. First, in order to distinguish between noise and useful information, we use two layers of the weight-guided filter and guided filter to obtain texture and edge layers, respectively. Second, to generate the initial visible-NIR complementarity weight map, the difference maps of visible and NIR are filtered by the extend-DoG filter. After that, the significant region of NIR night-time compensation guides the initial complementarity weight map by the arctanI function. Finally, the fusion images can be generated by the complementarity weight maps of visible and NIR images, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can not only well take advantage of the spectrum properties and the information complementarity, but also avoid color unnatural while maintaining naturalness, which outperforms the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it has limitations for reasoning with and combining imperfect (imprecise, uncertain, and partial) information. In this thesis, we study medical image segmentation approaches with belief function theory and deep learning, specifically focusing on information modeling and fusion based on uncertain evidence. First, we review existing belief function theory-based medical image segmentation methods and discuss their advantages and challenges. Second, we present a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework to decrease the uncertainty caused by the lack of annotations with evidential segmentation and evidence fusion. Third, we compare two evidential classifiers, evidential neural network and radial basis function network, and show the effectiveness of belief function theory in uncertainty quantification; we use the two evidential classifiers with deep neural networks to construct deep evidential models for lymphoma segmentation.

| **[Generation and Recombination for Multifocus Image Fusion with Free Number of Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04657v1)** | 2023-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multifocus image fusion is an effective way to overcome the limitation of optical lenses. Many existing methods obtain fused results by generating decision maps. However, such methods often assume that the focused areas of the two source images are complementary, making it impossible to achieve simultaneous fusion of multiple images. Additionally, the existing methods ignore the impact of hard pixels on fusion performance, limiting the visual quality improvement of fusion image. To address these issues, a combining generation and recombination model, termed as GRFusion, is proposed. In GRFusion, focus property detection of each source image can be implemented independently, enabling simultaneous fusion of multiple source images and avoiding information loss caused by alternating fusion. This makes GRFusion free from the number of inputs. To distinguish the hard pixels from the source images, we achieve the determination of hard pixels by considering the inconsistency among the detection results of focus areas in source images. Furthermore, a multi-directional gradient embedding method for generating full focus images is proposed. Subsequently, a hard-pixel-guided recombination mechanism for constructing fused result is devised, effectively integrating the complementary advantages of feature reconstruction-based method and focused pixel recombination-based method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method.The source code will be released on https://github.com/xxx/xxx.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/xxx/xxx) |

Despite its advancements, the field grapples with challenges, notably the reliance on manual designs for network structures and loss functions, and the constraints of utilizing simulated reference images as ground truths. Consequently, current methodologies often suffer from color distortions and exposure artifacts, further complicating the quest for authentic image representation. In addressing these challenges, this paper presents a Hybrid-Supervised Dual-Search approach for MEF, dubbed HSDS-MEF, which introduces a bi-level optimization search scheme for automatic design of both network structures and loss functions. More specifically, we harnesses a unique dual research mechanism rooted in a novel weighted structure refinement architecture search. Besides, a hybrid supervised contrast constraint seamlessly guides and integrates with searching process, facilitating a more adaptive and comprehensive search for optimal loss functions. We realize the state-of-the-art performance in comparison to various competitive schemes, yielding a 10.61% and 4.38% improvement in Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) for general and no-reference scenarios, respectively, while providing results with high contrast, rich details and colors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mutual-Guided Dynamic Network for Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12538v2)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion aims to generate a high-quality image from multiple images captured under varying conditions. The key problem of this task is to preserve complementary information while filtering out irrelevant information for the fused result. However, existing methods address this problem by leveraging static convolutional neural networks (CNNs), suffering two inherent limitations during feature extraction, i.e., being unable to handle spatial-variant contents and lacking guidance from multiple inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel mutual-guided dynamic network (MGDN) for image fusion, which allows for effective information utilization across different locations and inputs. Specifically, we design a mutual-guided dynamic filter (MGDF) for adaptive feature extraction, composed of a mutual-guided cross-attention (MGCA) module and a dynamic filter predictor, where the former incorporates additional guidance from different inputs and the latter generates spatial-variant kernels for different locations. In addition, we introduce a parallel feature fusion (PFF) module to effectively fuse local and global information of the extracted features. To further reduce the redundancy among the extracted features while simultaneously preserving their shared structural information, we devise a novel loss function that combines the minimization of normalized mutual information (NMI) with an estimated gradient mask. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on four image fusion tasks.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel model-driven deep unfolding framework with image reasoning prior tailored for the pan-sharpening task. Different from existing unfolding solutions that deliver the proximal operator networks as the uncertain and vague priors, our framework is motivated by the content reasoning ability of masked autoencoders (MAE) with insightful designs. Specifically, the pre-trained MAE with spatial masking strategy, acting as intrinsic reasoning prior, is embedded into unfolding architecture. Meanwhile, the pre-trained MAE with spatial-spectral masking strategy is treated as the regularization term within loss function to constrain the spatial-spectral consistency. Such designs penetrate the image reasoning prior into deep unfolding networks while improving its interpretability and representation capability. The uniqueness of our framework is that the holistic learning process is explicitly integrated with the inherent physical mechanism underlying the pan-sharpening task. Extensive experiments on multiple satellite datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[A Perceptually Optimized and Self-Calibrated Tone Mapping Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09146v3)** | 2023-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity and accessibility of high dynamic range (HDR) photography, tone mapping operators (TMOs) for dynamic range compression are practically demanding. In this paper, we develop a two-stage neural network-based TMO that is self-calibrated and perceptually optimized. In Stage one, motivated by the physiology of the early stages of the human visual system, we first decompose an HDR image into a normalized Laplacian pyramid. We then use two lightweight deep neural networks (DNNs), taking the normalized representation as input and estimating the Laplacian pyramid of the corresponding LDR image. We optimize the tone mapping network by minimizing the normalized Laplacian pyramid distance (NLPD), a perceptual metric aligning with human judgments of tone-mapped image quality. In Stage two, the input HDR image is self-calibrated to compute the final LDR image. We feed the same HDR image but rescaled with different maximum luminances to the learned tone mapping network, and generate a pseudo-multi-exposure image stack with different detail visibility and color saturation. We then train another lightweight DNN to fuse the LDR image stack into a desired LDR image by maximizing a variant of the structural similarity index for multi-exposure image fusion (MEF-SSIM), which has been proven perceptually relevant to fused image quality. The proposed self-calibration mechanism through MEF enables our TMO to accept uncalibrated HDR images, while being physiology-driven. Extensive experiments show that our method produces images with consistently better visual quality. Additionally, since our method builds upon three lightweight DNNs, it is among the fastest local TMOs.</p></details> | 15 pages,17 figures | None |

To leverage strong generative priors and address challenges such as unstable training and lack of interpretability for GAN-based generative methods, we propose a novel fusion algorithm based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). The fusion task is formulated as a conditional generation problem under the DDPM sampling framework, which is further divided into an unconditional generation subproblem and a maximum likelihood subproblem. The latter is modeled in a hierarchical Bayesian manner with latent variables and inferred by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By integrating the inference solution into the diffusion sampling iteration, our method can generate high-quality fused images with natural image generative priors and cross-modality information from source images. Note that all we required is an unconditional pre-trained generative model, and no fine-tuning is needed. Our extensive experiments indicate that our approach yields promising fusion results in infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion.

Existing efforts commonly resort to registering first and fusing later, typically employing two cascaded stages for registration,i.e., coarse registration and fine registration. Both stages directly estimate the respective target deformation fields. In this paper, we argue that the separated two-stage registration is not compact, and the direct estimation of the target deformation fields is not accurate enough. To address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modality Multi-scale Progressive Dense Registration (C-MPDR) scheme, which accomplishes the coarse-to-fine registration exclusively using a one-stage optimization, thus improving the fusion performance of misaligned multi-modality images. Specifically, two pivotal components are involved, a dense Deformation Field Fusion (DFF) module and a Progressive Feature Fine (PFF) module. The DFF aggregates the predicted multi-scale deformation sub-fields at the current scale, while the PFF progressively refines the remaining misaligned features. Both work together to accurately estimate the final deformation fields. In addition, we develop a Transformer-Conv-based Fusion (TCF) subnetwork that considers local and long-range feature dependencies, allowing us to capture more informative features from the registered infrared and visible images for the generation of high-quality fused images. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in the fusion of misaligned cross-modality images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, hindered by the slow convergence of RLIPv1 architecture and the limited availability of existing scene graph data, scaling RLIPv1 is challenging. In this paper, we propose RLIPv2, a fast converging model that enables the scaling of relational pre-training to large-scale pseudo-labelled scene graph data. To enable fast scaling, RLIPv2 introduces Asymmetric Language-Image Fusion (ALIF), a mechanism that facilitates earlier and deeper gated cross-modal fusion with sparsified language encoding layers. ALIF leads to comparable or better performance than RLIPv1 in a fraction of the time for pre-training and fine-tuning. To obtain scene graph data at scale, we extend object detection datasets with free-form relation labels by introducing a captioner (e.g., BLIP) and a designed Relation Tagger. The Relation Tagger assigns BLIP-generated relation texts to region pairs, thus enabling larger-scale relational pre-training. Through extensive experiments conducted on Human-Object Interaction Detection and Scene Graph Generation, RLIPv2 shows state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks under fully-finetuning, few-shot and zero-shot settings. Notably, the largest RLIPv2 achieves 23.29mAP on HICO-DET without any fine-tuning, yields 32.22mAP with just 1% data and yields 45.09mAP with 100% data.

Existing learning-based methods show remarkable performance, but are suffering from the inherent vulnerability of adversarial attacks, causing a significant decrease in accuracy. In this work, a perception-aware fusion framework is proposed to promote segmentation robustness in adversarial scenes. We first conduct systematic analyses about the components of image fusion, investigating the correlation with segmentation robustness under adversarial perturbations. Based on these analyses, we propose a harmonized architecture search with a decomposition-based structure to balance standard accuracy and robustness. We also propose an adaptive learning strategy to improve the parameter robustness of image fusion, which can learn effective feature extraction under diverse adversarial perturbations. Thus, the goals of image fusion (\textit{i.e.,} extracting complementary features from source modalities and defending attack) can be realized from the perspectives of architectural and learning strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our scheme substantially enhances the robustness, with gains of 15.3% mIOU of segmentation in the adversarial scene, compared with advanced competitors.

In recent developments, researchers not only focus on the quality of fused images but also evaluate their performance in downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the majority of methods seldom put their eyes on the mutual learning from different modalities, resulting in fused images lacking significant details and textures. To overcome this issue, we propose an interactive graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture between cross modality for fusion, called IGNet. Specifically, we first apply a multi-scale extractor to achieve shallow features, which are employed as the necessary input to build graph structures. Then, the graph interaction module can construct the extracted intermediate features of the infrared/visible branch into graph structures. Meanwhile, the graph structures of two branches interact for cross-modality and semantic learning, so that fused images can maintain the important feature expressions and enhance the performance of downstream tasks. Besides, the proposed leader nodes can improve information propagation in the same modality. Finally, we merge all graph features to get the fusion result. Extensive experiments on different datasets (TNO, MFNet and M3FD) demonstrate that our IGNet can generate visually appealing fused images while scoring averagely 2.59% mAP@.5 and 7.77% mIoU higher in detection and segmentation than the compared state-of-the-art methods.

Early efforts focus on boosting the performance for only one task, \emph{e.g.,} fusion or segmentation, making it hard to reach~`Best of Both Worlds'. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{i}nteractive \textbf{F}eature learning architecture for image fusion and \textbf{Seg}mentation, namely SegMiF, and exploit dual-task correlation to promote the performance of both tasks. The SegMiF is of a cascade structure, containing a fusion sub-network and a commonly used segmentation sub-network. By slickly bridging intermediate features between two components, the knowledge learned from the segmentation task can effectively assist the fusion task. Also, the benefited fusion network supports the segmentation one to perform more pretentiously. Besides, a hierarchical interactive attention block is established to ensure fine-grained mapping of all the vital information between two tasks, so that the modality/semantic features can be fully mutual-interactive. In addition, a dynamic weight factor is introduced to automatically adjust the corresponding weights of each task, which can balance the interactive feature correspondence and break through the limitation of laborious tuning. Furthermore, we construct a smart multi-wave binocular imaging system and collect a full-time multi-modality benchmark with 15 annotated pixel-level categories for image fusion and segmentation.

Besides, we design an effective data augmentation strategy termed Occlusion-aware GT Sampling (OGS) to reserve more sampled objects in the training scenes, so as to reduce overfitting.

| **[Real-time Human Detection in Fire Scenarios using Infrared and Thermal Imaging Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04223v1)** | 2023-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fire is considered one of the most serious threats to human lives which results in a high probability of fatalities. Those severe consequences stem from the heavy smoke emitted from a fire that mostly restricts the visibility of escaping victims and rescuing squad. In such hazardous circumstances, the use of a vision-based human detection system is able to improve the ability to save more lives. To this end, a thermal and infrared imaging fusion strategy based on multiple cameras for human detection in low-visibility scenarios caused by smoke is proposed in this paper. By processing with multiple cameras, vital information can be gathered to generate more useful features for human detection. Firstly, the cameras are calibrated using a Light Heating Chessboard. Afterward, the features extracted from the input images are merged prior to being passed through a lightweight deep neural network to perform the human detection task. The experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano computer demonstrated that the proposed method can process with reasonable speed and can achieve favorable performance with a mAP@0.5 of 95%.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion Using the Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03423v1)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images (HSI) have a large amount of spectral information reflecting the characteristics of matter, while their spatial resolution is low due to the limitations of imaging technology. Complementary to this are multispectral images (MSI), e.g., RGB images, with high spatial resolution but insufficient spectral bands. Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion is a technique for acquiring ideal images that have both high spatial and high spectral resolution cost-effectively. Many existing HSI and MSI fusion algorithms rely on known imaging degradation models, which are often not available in practice. In this paper, we propose a deep fusion method based on the conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model, called DDPM-Fus. Specifically, the DDPM-Fus contains the forward diffusion process which gradually adds Gaussian noise to the high spatial resolution HSI (HrHSI) and another reverse denoising process which learns to predict the desired HrHSI from its noisy version conditioning on the corresponding high spatial resolution MSI (HrMSI) and low spatial resolution HSI (LrHSI). Once the training is completes, the proposed DDPM-Fus implements the reverse process on the test HrMSI and LrHSI to generate the fused HrHSI. Experiments conducted on one indoor and two remote sensing datasets show the superiority of the proposed model when compared with other advanced deep learningbased fusion methods. The codes of this work will be opensourced at this address: https://github.com/shuaikaishi/DDPMFus for reproducibility.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/shuaikaishi/DDPMFus) |
| **[Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Images Fusion Based on the Cycle Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03413v1)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images (HSI) with abundant spectral information reflected materials property usually perform low spatial resolution due to the hardware limits. Meanwhile, multispectral images (MSI), e.g., RGB images, have a high spatial resolution but deficient spectral signatures. Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion can be cost-effective and efficient for acquiring both high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution images. Many of the conventional HSI and MSI fusion algorithms rely on known spatial degradation parameters, i.e., point spread function, spectral degradation parameters, spectral response function, or both of them. Another class of deep learning-based models relies on the ground truth of high spatial resolution HSI and needs large amounts of paired training images when working in a supervised manner. Both of these models are limited in practical fusion scenarios. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised HSI and MSI fusion model based on the cycle consistency, called CycFusion. The CycFusion learns the domain transformation between low spatial resolution HSI (LrHSI) and high spatial resolution MSI (HrMSI), and the desired high spatial resolution HSI (HrHSI) are considered to be intermediate feature maps in the transformation networks. The CycFusion can be trained with the objective functions of marginal matching in single transform and cycle consistency in double transforms. Moreover, the estimated PSF and SRF are embedded in the model as the pre-training weights, which further enhances the practicality of our proposed model. Experiments conducted on several datasets show that our proposed model outperforms all compared unsupervised fusion methods.

| **[DePF: A Novel Fusion Approach based on Decomposition Pooling for Infrared and Visible Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17376v2)** | 2023-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion aims to generate synthetic images simultaneously containing salient features and rich texture details, which can be used to boost downstream tasks. However, existing fusion methods are suffering from the issues of texture loss and edge information deficiency, which result in suboptimal fusion results. Meanwhile, the straight-forward up-sampling operator can not well preserve the source information from multi-scale features. To address these issues, a novel fusion network based on the decomposition pooling (de-pooling) manner is proposed, termed as DePF. Specifically, a de-pooling based encoder is designed to extract multi-scale image and detail features of source images at the same time. In addition, the spatial attention model is used to aggregate these salient features. After that, the fused features will be reconstructed by the decoder, in which the up-sampling operator is replaced by the de-pooling reversed operation. Different from the common max-pooling technique, image features after the de-pooling layer can retain abundant details information, which is benefit to the fusion process. In this case, rich texture information and multi-scale information are maintained during the reconstruction phase. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior fusion performance over the state-of-the-arts on multiple image fusion benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Guided Deep Generative Model-based Spatial Regularization for Multiband Imaging Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17197v1)** | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When adopting a model-based formulation, solving inverse problems encountered in multiband imaging requires to define spatial and spectral regularizations. In most of the works of the literature, spectral information is extracted from the observations directly to derive data-driven spectral priors. Conversely, the choice of the spatial regularization often boils down to the use of conventional penalizations (e.g., total variation) promoting expected features of the reconstructed image (e.g., piecewise constant). In this work, we propose a generic framework able to capitalize on an auxiliary acquisition of high spatial resolution to derive tailored data-driven spatial regularizations. This approach leverages on the ability of deep learning to extract high level features. More precisely, the regularization is conceived as a deep generative network able to encode spatial semantic features contained in this auxiliary image of high spatial resolution. To illustrate the versatility of this approach, it is instantiated to conduct two particular tasks, namely multiband image fusion and multiband image inpainting. Experimental results obtained on these two tasks demonstrate the benefit of this class of informed regularizations when compared to more conventional ones.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[M3PT: A Multi-Modal Model for POI Tagging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10079v1)** | 2023-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>POI tagging aims to annotate a point of interest (POI) with some informative tags, which facilitates many services related to POIs, including search, recommendation, and so on. Most of the existing solutions neglect the significance of POI images and seldom fuse the textual and visual features of POIs, resulting in suboptimal tagging performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Model for POI Tagging, namely M3PT, which achieves enhanced POI tagging through fusing the target POI's textual and visual features, and the precise matching between the multi-modal representations. Specifically, we first devise a domain-adaptive image encoder (DIE) to obtain the image embeddings aligned to their gold tags' semantics. Then, in M3PT's text-image fusion module (TIF), the textual and visual representations are fully fused into the POIs' content embeddings for the subsequent matching. In addition, we adopt a contrastive learning strategy to further bridge the gap between the representations of different modalities. To evaluate the tagging models' performance, we have constructed two high-quality POI tagging datasets from the real-world business scenario of Ali Fliggy. Upon the datasets, we conducted the extensive experiments to demonstrate our model's advantage over the baselines of uni-modality and multi-modality, and verify the effectiveness of important components in M3PT, including DIE, TIF and the contrastive learning strategy.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2023 | None |

Our solution involves an efficient multi-stage framework that restores a high-quality image from distorted frames. Specifically, a frame selection algorithm based on sharpness is first utilized to select the sharpest set of distorted frames. Next, each frame in the selected frames is aligned to suppress geometric distortion through optical-flow-based image registration. Then, a region-based image fusion method with DT-CWT is utilized to mitigate the blur caused by the turbulence. Finally, a learning-based deartifacts method is applied to remove the artifacts in the fused image, generating a high-quality outuput. Our framework can handle both hot-air text dataset and turbulence text dataset provided in the final testing phase and achieved 1st place in text recognition accuracy.

In this case, infrared and visible images can be used together to provide both rich detail information and effective target areas. In this paper, we present LLVIP, a visible-infrared paired dataset for low-light vision. This dataset contains 30976 images, or 15488 pairs, most of which were taken at very dark scenes, and all of the images are strictly aligned in time and space. Pedestrians in the dataset are labeled. We compare the dataset with other visible-infrared datasets and evaluate the performance of some popular visual algorithms including image fusion, pedestrian detection and image-to-image translation on the dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the complementary effect of fusion on image information, and find the deficiency of existing algorithms of the three visual tasks in very low-light conditions. We believe the LLVIP dataset will contribute to the community of computer vision by promoting image fusion, pedestrian detection and image-to-image translation in very low-light applications.

Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

However, under complex illumination conditions, few algorithms pay attention to the edge information of local regions which is crucial for downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a fusion network based on the local edge enhancement, named LE2Fusion. Specifically, a local edge enhancement (LE2) module is proposed to improve the edge information under complex illumination conditions and preserve the essential features of image. For feature extraction, a multi-scale residual attention (MRA) module is applied to extract rich features. Then, with LE2, a set of enhancement weights are generated which are utilized in feature fusion strategy and used to guide the image reconstruction. To better preserve the local detail information and structure information, the pixel intensity loss function based on the local region is also presented. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits better fusion performance than the state-of-the-art fusion methods on public datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Task-guided, Implicitly-searched and Meta-initialized Deep Model for Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15862v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion plays a key role in a variety of multi-sensor-based vision systems, especially for enhancing visual quality and/or extracting aggregated features for perception. However, most existing methods just consider image fusion as an individual task, thus ignoring its underlying relationship with these downstream vision problems. Furthermore, designing proper fusion architectures often requires huge engineering labor. It also lacks mechanisms to improve the flexibility and generalization ability of current fusion approaches. To mitigate these issues, we establish a Task-guided, Implicit-searched and Meta-initialized (TIM) deep model to address the image fusion problem in a challenging real-world scenario. Specifically, we first propose a constrained strategy to incorporate information from downstream tasks to guide the unsupervised learning process of image fusion. Within this framework, we then design an implicit search scheme to automatically discover compact architectures for our fusion model with high efficiency. In addition, a pretext meta initialization technique is introduced to leverage divergence fusion data to support fast adaptation for different kinds of image fusion tasks. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on different categories of image fusion problems and related downstream tasks (e.g., visual enhancement and semantic understanding) substantiate the flexibility and effectiveness of our TIM.

In this paper, we study the MEF problem from a new perspective. We don't utilize any synthesized ground truth, design any loss function, or develop any fusion strategy. Our proposed method EMEF takes advantage of the wisdom of multiple imperfect MEF contributors including both conventional and deep learning-based methods. Specifically, EMEF consists of two main stages: pre-train an imitator network and tune the imitator in the runtime. In the first stage, we make a unified network imitate different MEF targets in a style modulation way. In the second stage, we tune the imitator network by optimizing the style code, in order to find an optimal fusion result for each input pair. In the experiment, we construct EMEF from four state-of-the-art MEF methods and then make comparisons with the individuals and several other competitive methods on the latest released MEF benchmark dataset. The promising experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble framework can "get the best of all worlds".

| **[Multi-Focus Image Fusion Based on Spatial Frequency(SF) and Consistency Verification(CV) in DCT Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11265v1)** | 2023-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-focus is a technique of focusing on different aspects of a particular object or scene. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) use multi-focus image fusion, which combines two or more images to create a more accurate output image that describes the scene better than any individual input image. WVSN has various applications, including video surveillance, monitoring, and tracking. Therefore, a high-level analysis of these networks can benefit Biometrics. This paper introduces an algorithm that utilizes discrete cosine transform (DCT) standards to fuse multi-focus images in WVSNs. The spatial frequency (SF) of the corresponding blocks from the source images determines the fusion criterion. The blocks with higher spatial frequencies make up the DCT presentation of the fused image, and the Consistency Verification (CV) procedure is used to enhance the output image quality. The proposed fusion method was tested on multiple pairs of multi-focus images coded on JPEG standard to evaluate the fusion performance, and the results indicate that it improves the visual quality of the output image and outperforms other DCT-based techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

Through empirical analysis, infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) enables hard-to-find objects apparent, whereas multimodal salient object detection (SOD) accurately delineates the precise spatial location of objects within the picture. Their common characteristic of seeking complementary cues from different source images motivates us to explore the collaborative relationship between Fusion and Salient object detection tasks on infrared and visible images via an Interactively Reinforced multi-task paradigm for the first time, termed IRFS. To the seamless bridge of multimodal image fusion and SOD tasks, we specifically develop a Feature Screening-based Fusion subnetwork (FSFNet) to screen out interfering features from source images, thereby preserving saliency-related features. After generating the fused image through FSFNet, it is then fed into the subsequent Fusion-Guided Cross-Complementary SOD subnetwork (FC$^2$Net) as the third modality to drive the precise prediction of the saliency map by leveraging the complementary information derived from the fused image. In addition, we develop an interactive loop learning strategy to achieve the mutual reinforcement of IVIF and SOD tasks with a shorter training period and fewer network parameters. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the seamless bridge of IVIF and SOD mutually enhances their performance, and highlights their superiority.</p></details> |  | None |

However, early efforts always consider boosting a single task unilaterally and neglecting others, seldom investigating their underlying connections for joint promotion. To overcome these limitations, we establish the hierarchical dual tasks-driven deep model to bridge these tasks. Concretely, we firstly construct an image fusion module to fuse complementary characteristics and cascade dual task-related modules, including a discriminator for visual effects and a semantic network for feature measurement. We provide a bi-level perspective to formulate image fusion and follow-up downstream tasks. To incorporate distinct task-related responses for image fusion, we consider image fusion as a primary goal and dual modules as learnable constraints. Furthermore, we develop an efficient first-order approximation to compute corresponding gradients and present dynamic weighted aggregation to balance the gradients for fusion learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, which not only produces visually pleasant fused results but also realizes significant promotion for detection and segmentation than the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,6 figures, published to IJCAI</p></details> | None |
