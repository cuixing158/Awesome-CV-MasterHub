| **[One-step Diffusion Models with $f$-Divergence Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15681v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from diffusion models involves a slow iterative process that hinders their practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To accelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion model into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation, which matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the teacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be mode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach using a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that covers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode coverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence between the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as the product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by their density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with higher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking divergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach using the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as forward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best variational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In particular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current state-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot text-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

| **[LaRE$^2$: Latent Reconstruction Error Based Method for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17465v4)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Diffusion Models has dramatically improved image generation quality, making it increasingly difficult to differentiate between real and generated images. This development, while impressive, also raises significant privacy and security concerns. In response to this, we propose a novel Latent REconstruction error guided feature REfinement method (LaRE^2) for detecting the diffusion-generated images. We come up with the Latent Reconstruction Error (LaRE), the first reconstruction-error based feature in the latent space for generated image detection. LaRE surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction efficiency while preserving crucial cues required to differentiate between the real and the fake. To exploit LaRE, we propose an Error-Guided feature REfinement module (EGRE), which can refine the image feature guided by LaRE to enhance the discriminativeness of the feature. Our EGRE utilizes an align-then-refine mechanism, which effectively refines the image feature for generated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives. Extensive experiments on the large-scale GenImage benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our LaRE^2, which surpasses the best SoTA method by up to 11.9%/12.1% average ACC/AP across 8 different image generators. LaRE also surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction cost, delivering an impressive speed enhancement of 8 times.

| **[Soybean pod and seed counting in both outdoor fields and indoor laboratories using unions of deep neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15286v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic counting soybean pods and seeds in outdoor fields allows for rapid yield estimation before harvesting, while indoor laboratory counting offers greater accuracy. Both methods can significantly accelerate the breeding process. However, it remains challenging for accurately counting pods and seeds in outdoor fields, and there are still no accurate enough tools for counting pods and seeds in laboratories. In this study, we developed efficient deep learning models for counting soybean pods and seeds in both outdoor fields and indoor laboratories. For outdoor fields, annotating not only visible seeds but also occluded seeds makes YOLO have the ability to estimate the number of soybean seeds that are occluded. Moreover, we enhanced YOLO architecture by integrating it with HQ-SAM (YOLO-SAM), and domain adaptation techniques (YOLO-DA), to improve model robustness and generalization across soybean images taken in outdoor fields. Testing on soybean images from the outdoor field, we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.13 for pod counting and 10.05 for seed counting. For the indoor setting, we utilized Mask-RCNN supplemented with a Swin Transformer module (Mask-RCNN-Swin), models were trained exclusively on synthetic training images generated from a small set of labeled data. This approach resulted in near-perfect accuracy, with an MAE of 1.07 for pod counting and 1.33 for seed counting across actual laboratory images from two distinct studies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsettling the Hegemony of Intention: Agonistic Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15242v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current image generation paradigms prioritize actualizing user intention - "see what you intend" - but often neglect the sociopolitical dimensions of this process. However, it is increasingly evident that image generation is political, contributing to broader social struggles over visual meaning. This sociopolitical aspect was highlighted by the March 2024 Gemini controversy, where Gemini faced criticism for inappropriately injecting demographic diversity into user prompts. Although the developers sought to redress image generation's sociopolitical dimension by introducing diversity "corrections," their opaque imposition of a standard for "diversity" ultimately proved counterproductive. In this paper, we present an alternative approach: an image generation interface designed to embrace open negotiation along the sociopolitical dimensions of image creation. Grounded in the principles of agonistic pluralism (from the Greek agon, meaning struggle), our interface actively engages users with competing visual interpretations of their prompts. Through a lab study with 29 participants, we evaluate our agonistic interface on its ability to facilitate reflection - engagement with other perspectives and challenging dominant assumptions - a core principle that underpins agonistic contestation. We compare it to three existing paradigms: a standard interface, a Gemini-style interface that produces "diverse" images, and an intention-centric interface suggesting prompt refinements. Our findings demonstrate that the agonistic interface enhances reflection across multiple measures, but also that reflection depends on users perceiving the interface as both appropriate and empowering; introducing diversity without grounding it in relevant political contexts was perceived as inauthentic. Our results suggest that diversity and user intention should not be treated as opposing values to be balanced.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FlipConcept: Tuning-Free Multi-Concept Personalization for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15203v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, methods that integrate multiple personalized concepts into a single image have garnered significant attention in the field of text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods experience performance degradation in complex scenes with multiple objects due to distortions in non-personalized regions. To address this issue, we propose FlipConcept, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates multiple personalized concepts into a single image without requiring additional tuning. We introduce guided appearance attention to accurately mimic the appearance of a personalized concept as intended. Additionally, we introduce mask-guided noise mixing to protect non-personalized regions during editing. Lastly, we apply background dilution to minimize attribute leakage, which is the undesired blending of personalized concept attributes with other objects in the image. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method, despite not requiring tuning, outperforms existing models in both single and multiple personalized concept inference.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Methods and Trends in Detecting Generated Images: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15176v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), has enabled the synthesis of high-quality multimedia data. However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have primarily focused on deepfake detection and often lack coverage of recent advancements in synthetic image detection, particularly methods leveraging multimodal frameworks for improved forensic analysis. To address this gap, the present survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. This review systematically examines core detection methodologies, identifies commonalities among approaches, and categorizes them into meaningful taxonomies. Furthermore, given the crucial role of large-scale datasets in this field, we present an overview of publicly available datasets that facilitate further research and benchmarking in synthetic data detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 4 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Generative Modeling of Individual Behavior at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14998v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in using AI to model human behavior, particularly in domains where humans interact with this technology. While most existing work models human behavior at an aggregate level, our goal is to model behavior at the individual level. Recent approaches to behavioral stylometry -- or the task of identifying a person from their actions alone -- have shown promise in domains like chess, but these approaches are either not scalable (e.g., fine-tune a separate model for each person) or not generative, in that they cannot generate actions. We address these limitations by framing behavioral stylometry as a multi-task learning problem -- where each task represents a distinct person -- and use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to learn an explicit style vector for each person. Style vectors are generative: they selectively activate shared "skill" parameters to generate actions in the style of each person. They also induce a latent space that we can interpret and manipulate algorithmically. In particular, we develop a general technique for style steering that allows us to steer a player's style vector towards a desired property. We apply our approach to two very different games, at unprecedented scales: chess (47,864 players) and Rocket League (2,000 players). We also show generality beyond gaming by applying our method to image generation, where we learn style vectors for 10,177 celebrities and use these vectors to steer their images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving the Diffusability of Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14831v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for generating high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[DC-ControlNet: Decoupling Inter- and Intra-Element Conditions in Image Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14779v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce DC (Decouple)-ControlNet, a highly flexible and precisely controllable framework for multi-condition image generation. The core idea behind DC-ControlNet is to decouple control conditions, transforming global control into a hierarchical system that integrates distinct elements, contents, and layouts. This enables users to mix these individual conditions with greater flexibility, leading to more efficient and accurate image generation control. Previous ControlNet-based models rely solely on global conditions, which affect the entire image and lack the ability of element- or region-specific control. This limitation reduces flexibility and can cause condition misunderstandings in multi-conditional image generation. To address these challenges, we propose both intra-element and Inter-element Controllers in DC-ControlNet. The Intra-Element Controller handles different types of control signals within individual elements, accurately describing the content and layout characteristics of the object. For interactions between elements, we introduce the Inter-Element Controller, which accurately handles multi-element interactions and occlusion based on user-defined relationships. Extensive evaluations show that DC-ControlNet significantly outperforms existing ControlNet models and Layout-to-Image generative models in terms of control flexibility and precision in multi-condition control.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AIdeation: Designing a Human-AI Collaborative Ideation System for Concept Designers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14747v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept designers in the entertainment industry create highly detailed, often imaginary environments for movies, games, and TV shows. Their early ideation phase requires intensive research, brainstorming, visual exploration, and combination of various design elements to form cohesive designs. However, existing AI tools focus on image generation from user specifications, lacking support for the unique needs and complexity of concept designers' workflows. Through a formative study with 12 professional designers, we captured their workflows and identified key requirements for AI-assisted ideation tools. Leveraging these insights, we developed AIdeation to support early ideation by brainstorming design concepts with flexible searching and recombination of reference images. A user study with 16 professional designers showed that AIdeation significantly enhanced creativity, ideation efficiency, and satisfaction (all p<.01) compared to current tools and workflows. A field study with 4 studios for 1 week provided insights into AIdeation's benefits and limitations in real-world projects. After the completion of the field study, two studios, covering films, television, and games, have continued to use AIdeation in their commercial projects to date, further validating AIdeation's improvement in ideation quality and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '25)</p></details> | None |
| **[FlexControl: Computation-Aware ControlNet with Differentiable Router for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10451v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ControlNet offers a powerful way to guide diffusion-based generative models, yet most implementations rely on ad-hoc heuristics to choose which network blocks to control-an approach that varies unpredictably with different tasks. To address this gap, we propose FlexControl, a novel framework that copies all diffusion blocks during training and employs a trainable gating mechanism to dynamically select which blocks to activate at each denoising step. With introducing a computation-aware loss, we can encourage control blocks only to activate when it benefit the generation quality. By eliminating manual block selection, FlexControl enhances adaptability across diverse tasks and streamlines the design pipeline, with computation-aware training loss in an end-to-end training manner. Through comprehensive experiments on both UNet (e.g., SD1.5) and DiT (e.g., SD3.0), we show that our method outperforms existing ControlNet variants in certain key aspects of interest. As evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, FlexControl preserves or enhances image fidelity while also reducing computational overhead by selectively activating the most relevant blocks. These results underscore the potential of a flexible, data-driven approach for controlled diffusion and open new avenues for efficient generative model design. The code will soon be available at https://github.com/Anonymousuuser/FlexControl.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Anonymousuuser/FlexControl) |
| **[PFDiff: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models Combining Past and Future Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08822v3)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown remarkable potential in image generation, but their sampling efficiency is hindered by the need for numerous denoising steps. Most existing solutions accelerate the sampling process by proposing fast ODE solvers. However, the inevitable discretization errors of the ODE solvers are significantly magnified when the number of function evaluations (NFE) is fewer. In this work, we propose PFDiff, a novel training-free and orthogonal timestep-skipping strategy, which enables existing fast ODE solvers to operate with fewer NFE. Specifically, PFDiff initially utilizes score replacement from past time steps to predict a ``springboard". Subsequently, it employs this ``springboard" along with foresight updates inspired by Nesterov momentum to rapidly update current intermediate states. This approach effectively reduces unnecessary NFE while correcting for discretization errors inherent in first-order ODE solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that PFDiff exhibits flexible applicability across various pre-trained DPMs, particularly excelling in conditional DPMs and surpassing previous state-of-the-art training-free methods. For instance, using DDIM as a baseline, we achieved 16.46 FID (4 NFE) compared to 138.81 FID with DDIM on ImageNet 64x64 with classifier guidance, and 13.06 FID (10 NFE) on Stable Diffusion with 7.5 guidance scale.

| **[T2ISafety: Benchmark for Assessing Fairness, Toxicity, and Privacy in Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12612v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have rapidly advanced, enabling the generation of high-quality images from text prompts across various domains. However, these models present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating harmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety remains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing. Data and evaluator are released under https://github.com/adwardlee/t2i_safety.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/adwardlee/t2i_safety) |
| **[Pandora3D: A Comprehensive Framework for High-Quality 3D Shape and Texture Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14247v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report presents a comprehensive framework for generating high-quality 3D shapes and textures from diverse input prompts, including single images, multi-view images, and text descriptions. The framework consists of 3D shape generation and texture generation. (1). The 3D shape generation pipeline employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode implicit 3D geometries into a latent space and a diffusion network to generate latents conditioned on input prompts, with modifications to enhance model capacity. An alternative Artist-Created Mesh (AM) generation approach is also explored, yielding promising results for simpler geometries. (2). Texture generation involves a multi-stage process starting with frontal images generation followed by multi-view images generation, RGB-to-PBR texture conversion, and high-resolution multi-view texture refinement. A consistency scheduler is plugged into every stage, to enforce pixel-wise consistency among multi-view textures during inference, ensuring seamless integration. The pipeline demonstrates effective handling of diverse input formats, leveraging advanced neural architectures and novel methodologies to produce high-quality 3D content. This report details the system architecture, experimental results, and potential future directions to improve and expand the framework. The source code and pretrained weights are released at: \url{https://github.com/Tencent/Tencent-XR-3DGen}.</p></details> | Tencent XR 3D Gen | [Code Link](https://github.com/Tencent/Tencent-XR-3DGen) |
| **[Robust Concept Erasure Using Task Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03631v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of text-to-image models, a variety of techniques have been suggested to prevent undesirable image generations. Yet, these methods often only protect against specific user prompts and have been shown to allow unsafe generations with other inputs. Here we focus on unconditionally erasing a concept from a text-to-image model rather than conditioning the erasure on the user's prompt. We first show that compared to input-dependent erasure methods, concept erasure that uses Task Vectors (TV) is more robust to unexpected user inputs, not seen during training. However, TV-based erasure can also affect the core performance of the edited model, particularly when the required edit strength is unknown. To this end, we propose a method called Diverse Inversion, which we use to estimate the required strength of the TV edit. Diverse Inversion finds within the model input space a large set of word embeddings, each of which induces the generation of the target concept. We find that encouraging diversity in the set makes our estimation more robust to unexpected prompts. Finally, we show that Diverse Inversion enables us to apply a TV edit only to a subset of the model weights, enhancing the erasure capabilities while better maintaining the core functionality of the model.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FlexTok: Resampling Images into 1D Token Sequences of Flexible Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13967v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image tokenization has enabled major advances in autoregressive image generation by providing compressed, discrete representations that are more efficient to process than raw pixels. While traditional approaches use 2D grid tokenization, recent methods like TiTok have shown that 1D tokenization can achieve high generation quality by eliminating grid redundancies. However, these methods typically use a fixed number of tokens and thus cannot adapt to an image's inherent complexity. We introduce FlexTok, a tokenizer that projects 2D images into variable-length, ordered 1D token sequences. For example, a 256x256 image can be resampled into anywhere from 1 to 256 discrete tokens, hierarchically and semantically compressing its information. By training a rectified flow model as the decoder and using nested dropout, FlexTok produces plausible reconstructions regardless of the chosen token sequence length. We evaluate our approach in an autoregressive generation setting using a simple GPT-style Transformer. On ImageNet, this approach achieves an FID<2 across 8 to 128 tokens, outperforming TiTok and matching state-of-the-art methods with far fewer tokens. We further extend the model to support to text-conditioned image generation and examine how FlexTok relates to traditional 2D tokenization. A key finding is that FlexTok enables next-token prediction to describe images in a coarse-to-fine "visual vocabulary", and that the number of tokens to generate depends on the complexity of the generation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://flextok.epfl.ch/</p></details> | None |
| **[IP-Composer: Semantic Composition of Visual Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13951v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content creators often draw inspiration from multiple visual sources, combining distinct elements to craft new compositions. Modern computational approaches now aim to emulate this fundamental creative process. Although recent diffusion models excel at text-guided compositional synthesis, text as a medium often lacks precise control over visual details. Image-based composition approaches can capture more nuanced features, but existing methods are typically limited in the range of concepts they can capture, and require expensive training procedures or specialized data. We present IP-Composer, a novel training-free approach for compositional image generation that leverages multiple image references simultaneously, while using natural language to describe the concept to be extracted from each image. Our method builds on IP-Adapter, which synthesizes novel images conditioned on an input image's CLIP embedding. We extend this approach to multiple visual inputs by crafting composite embeddings, stitched from the projections of multiple input images onto concept-specific CLIP-subspaces identified through text. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach enables more precise control over a larger range of visual concept compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ip-composer.github.io/IP-Composer/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ip-composer.github.io/IP-Composer) |

While scaling these models up to billions of parameters shows promise, the effectiveness of scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational heterogeneity of image generations, we develop a new family of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (EC-DIT) for diffusion transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns to adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the input texts and generate the respective image patches, enabling heterogeneous computation aligned with varying text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters and achieving significant improvements in training convergence, text-to-image alignment, and overall generation quality over dense models and conventional MoE models. Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates superior scalability and adaptive compute allocation by recognizing varying textual importance through end-to-end training. Notably, in text-to-image alignment evaluation, our largest models achieve a state-of-the-art GenEval score of 71.68% and still maintain competitive inference speed with intuitive interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |

While text-to-image generation has made strides in photorealistic imagery, creating accurate geometric diagrams remains a challenge due to the need for precise spatial relationships and the scarcity of geometry-specific datasets. This paper presents MagicGeo, a training-free framework for generating geometric diagrams from textual descriptions. MagicGeo formulates the diagram generation process as a coordinate optimization problem, ensuring geometric correctness through a formal language solver, and then employs coordinate-aware generation. The framework leverages the strong language translation capability of large language models, while formal mathematical solving ensures geometric correctness. We further introduce MagicGeoBench, a benchmark dataset of 220 geometric diagram descriptions, and demonstrate that MagicGeo outperforms current methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. This work provides a scalable, accurate solution for automated diagram generation, with significant implications for educational and academic applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PoGDiff: Product-of-Gaussians Diffusion Models for Imbalanced Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08106v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Are generative models fair? A study of racial bias in dermatological image generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11752v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Racial bias in medicine, such as in dermatology, presents significant ethical and clinical challenges. This is likely to happen because there is a significant underrepresentation of darker skin tones in training datasets for machine learning models. While efforts to address bias in dermatology have focused on improving dataset diversity and mitigating disparities in discriminative models, the impact of racial bias on generative models remains underexplored. Generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), are increasingly used in healthcare applications, yet their fairness across diverse skin tones is currently not well understood. In this study, we evaluate the fairness of generative models in clinical dermatology with respect to racial bias. For this purpose, we first train a VAE with a perceptual loss to generate and reconstruct high-quality skin images across different skin tones. We utilize the Fitzpatrick17k dataset to examine how racial bias influences the representation and performance of these models. Our findings indicate that VAE performance is, as expected, influenced by representation, i.e. increased skin tone representation comes with increased performance on the given skin tone. However, we also observe, even independently of representation, that the VAE performs better for lighter skin tones. Additionally, the uncertainty estimates produced by the VAE are ineffective in assessing the model's fairness. These results highlight the need for more representative dermatological datasets, but also a need for better understanding the sources of bias in such model, as well as improved uncertainty quantification mechanisms to detect and address racial bias in generative models for trustworthy healthcare technologies.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Generating high-quality realistic images from user-specified rough hand-drawn sketches is one such task that aims to impose a structural constraint on the conditional generation process. While the premise is intriguing for numerous use cases of content creation and academic research, the problem becomes fundamentally challenging due to substantial ambiguities in freehand sketches. Furthermore, balancing the trade-off between shape consistency and realistic generation contributes to additional complexity in the process. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generally utilize conditional GANs or GAN inversions, often requiring application-specific data and optimization objectives. The recent introduction of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieves a generational leap for low-level visual attributes in general image synthesis. However, directly retraining a large-scale diffusion model on a domain-specific subtask is often extremely difficult due to demanding computation costs and insufficient data. In this paper, we introduce a technique for sketch-to-image translation by exploiting the feature generalization capabilities of a large-scale diffusion model without retraining. In particular, we use a learnable lightweight mapping network to achieve latent feature translation from source to target domain.

However, current methods struggle to simultaneously maintain the fidelity of human identity and ensure the consistency of textual prompts, often resulting in suboptimal outcomes. This shortcoming is primarily due to the lack of effective constraints during the simultaneous integration of visual and textual prompts, leading to unhealthy mutual interference that compromises the full expression of both types of input. Building on prior research that suggests visual and textual conditions influence different regions of an image in distinct ways, we introduce a novel Dual-Pathway Adapter (DP-Adapter) to enhance both high-fidelity identity preservation and textual consistency in personalized human image generation. Our approach begins by decoupling the target human image into visually sensitive and text-sensitive regions. For visually sensitive regions, DP-Adapter employs an Identity-Enhancing Adapter (IEA) to preserve detailed identity features. For text-sensitive regions, we introduce a Textual-Consistency Adapter (TCA) to minimize visual interference and ensure the consistency of textual semantics. To seamlessly integrate these pathways, we develop a Fine-Grained Feature-Level Blending (FFB) module that efficiently combines hierarchical semantic features from both pathways, resulting in more natural and coherent synthesis outcomes. Additionally, DP-Adapter supports various innovative applications, including controllable headshot-to-full-body portrait generation, age editing, old-photo to reality, and expression editing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SigStyle: Signature Style Transfer via Personalized Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13997v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Style transfer enables the seamless integration of artistic styles from a style image into a content image, resulting in visually striking and aesthetically enriched outputs. Despite numerous advances in this field, existing methods did not explicitly focus on the signature style, which represents the distinct and recognizable visual traits of the image such as geometric and structural patterns, color palettes and brush strokes etc. In this paper, we introduce SigStyle, a framework that leverages the semantic priors that embedded in a personalized text-to-image diffusion model to capture the signature style representation. This style capture process is powered by a hypernetwork that efficiently fine-tunes the diffusion model for any given single style image. Style transfer then is conceptualized as the reconstruction process of content image through learned style tokens from the personalized diffusion model. Additionally, to ensure the content consistency throughout the style transfer process, we introduce a time-aware attention swapping technique that incorporates content information from the original image into the early denoising steps of target image generation. Beyond enabling high-quality signature style transfer across a wide range of styles, SigStyle supports multiple interesting applications, such as local style transfer, texture transfer, style fusion and style-guided text-to-image generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate our approach outperforms existing style transfer methods for recognizing and transferring the signature styles.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike VAR, which is constrained to class-conditioned synthesis for images up to 256$\times$256, STAR enables text-driven image generation up to 1024$\times$1024 through three key designs. First, we introduce a pre-trained text encoder to extract and adopt representations for textual constraints, enhancing details and generalizability. Second, given the inherent structural correlation across different scales, we leverage 2D Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) and tweak it into a normalized version, ensuring consistent interpretation of relative positions across token maps and stabilizing the training process. Third, we observe that simultaneously sampling all tokens within a single scale can disrupt inter-token relationships, leading to structural instability, particularly in high-resolution generation. To address this, we propose a novel stable sampling method that incorporates causal relationships into the sampling process, ensuring both rich details and stable structures. Compared to previous diffusion models and auto-regressive models, STAR surpasses existing benchmarks in fidelity, text-image consistency, and aesthetic quality, requiring just 2.21s for 1024$\times$1024 images on A100. This highlights the potential of auto-regressive methods in high-quality image synthesis, offering new directions for the text-to-image generation.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

Flow-based generative models provide a powerful framework for capturing complex probability distributions, offering exact likelihood estimation, efficient sampling, and deterministic transformations between distributions. These models leverage invertible mappings governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), enabling precise density estimation and likelihood evaluation. This tutorial presents an intuitive mathematical framework for flow-based generative models, formulating them as neural network-based representations of continuous probability densities.

Machine unlearning has emerged as a viable solution, aiming to remove specific training data, e.g., containing private information and bias, from models. In this paper, we study the machine unlearning problem in Image-to-Image (I2I) generative models. Previous studies mainly treat it as a single objective optimization problem, offering a solitary solution, thereby neglecting the varied user expectations towards the trade-off between complete unlearning and model utility. To address this issue, we propose a controllable unlearning framework that uses a control coefficient $\varepsilon$ to control the trade-off. We reformulate the I2I generative model unlearning problem into a $\varepsilon$-constrained optimization problem and solve it with a gradient-based method to find optimal solutions for unlearning boundaries. These boundaries define the valid range for the control coefficient. Within this range, every yielded solution is theoretically guaranteed with Pareto optimality. We also analyze the convergence rate of our framework under various control functions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across three mainstream I2I models demonstrate the effectiveness of our controllable unlearning framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

BCIs, particularly those leveraging Electroencephalography (EEG), provide a non-invasive means of translating neural activity into meaningful outputs. Recent advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly improved EEG-based generation of images, text, and speech. This paper provides a literature review of the state-of-the-art in EEG-based multimodal generation, focusing on (i) EEG-to-image generation through GANs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models, and (ii) EEG-to-text generation leveraging Transformer based language models and contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we discuss the emerging domain of EEG-to-speech synthesis, an evolving multimodal frontier. We highlight key datasets, use cases, challenges, and EEG feature encoding methods that underpin generative approaches.

| **[Breaking the bonds of generative artificial intelligence by minimizing the maximum entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13287v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), comprising large language models, text-to-image generators, and AI algorithms for medical drug and material design, had a transformative impact on society. However, despite an initial exponential growth surpassing Moore's law, progress is now plateauing, suggesting we are approaching the limits of current technology. Indeed, these models are notoriously data-hungry, prone to overfitting, and challenging to direct during the generative process, hampering their effective professional employment. To cope with these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift in GenAI by introducing an ab initio method based on the minimal maximum entropy principle. Our approach does not fit the data. Instead, it compresses information in the training set by finding a latent representation parameterized by arbitrary nonlinear functions, such as neural networks. The result is a general physics-driven model, which is data-efficient, resistant to overfitting, and flexible, permitting to control and influence the generative process. Benchmarking shows that our method outperforms variational autoencoders (VAEs) with similar neural architectures, particularly on undersampled datasets. We demonstrate the methods effectiveness in generating images, even with limited training data, and its unprecedented capability to customize the generation process a posteriori without the need of any fine-tuning or retraining.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures | None |

Specifically, we attempt to generate a person image such that the synthesized instance can blend into a complex scene. In our method, the position, scale, and appearance of the generated person are semantically conditioned on the existing persons in the scene. The proposed technique is divided into three sequential steps. At first, we employ a Pix2PixHD model to infer a coarse semantic mask that represents the new person's spatial location, scale, and potential pose. Next, we use a data-centric approach to select the closest representation from a precomputed cluster of fine semantic masks. Finally, we adopt a multi-scale, attention-guided architecture to transfer the appearance attributes from an exemplar image. The proposed strategy enables us to synthesize semantically coherent realistic persons that can blend into an existing scene without altering the global context. We conclude our findings with relevant qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Ctrl-U: Robust Conditional Image Generation via Uncertainty-aware Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11236v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on the task of conditional image generation, where an image is synthesized according to user instructions. The critical challenge underpinning this task is ensuring both the fidelity of the generated images and their semantic alignment with the provided conditions. To tackle this issue, previous studies have employed supervised perceptual losses derived from pre-trained models, i.e., reward models, to enforce alignment between the condition and the generated result. However, we observe one inherent shortcoming: considering the diversity of synthesized images, the reward model usually provides inaccurate feedback when encountering newly generated data, which can undermine the training process. To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware reward modeling, called Ctrl-U, including uncertainty estimation and uncertainty-aware regularization, designed to reduce the adverse effects of imprecise feedback from the reward model. Given the inherent cognitive uncertainty within reward models, even images generated under identical conditions often result in a relatively large discrepancy in reward loss. Inspired by the observation, we explicitly leverage such prediction variance as an uncertainty indicator. Based on the uncertainty estimation, we regularize the model training by adaptively rectifying the reward. In particular, rewards with lower uncertainty receive higher loss weights, while those with higher uncertainty are given reduced weights to allow for larger variability. The proposed uncertainty regularization facilitates reward fine-tuning through consistency construction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our methodology in improving the controllability and generation quality, as well as its scalability across diverse conditional scenarios.

However, this task becomes even more difficult under constrained situations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline to generate and insert contextually relevant person images into an existing scene while preserving the global semantics. More specifically, we aim to insert a person such that the location, pose, and scale of the person being inserted blends in with the existing persons in the scene. Our method uses three individual networks in a sequential pipeline. At first, we predict the potential location and the skeletal structure of the new person by conditioning a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) on the existing human skeletons present in the scene. Next, the predicted skeleton is refined through a shallow linear network to achieve higher structural accuracy in the generated image. Finally, the target image is generated from the refined skeleton using another generative network conditioned on a given image of the target person. In our experiments, we achieve high-resolution photo-realistic generation results while preserving the general context of the scene. We conclude our paper with multiple qualitative and quantitative benchmarks on the results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2022</p></details> | None |

Given a small set of images with user-specific concept, personalized image generation allows to create images that incorporate the specified concept and adhere to provided text descriptions. Due to its wide applications in content creation, significant effort has been devoted to this field in recent years. Nonetheless, the technologies used for personalization have evolved alongside the development of generative models, with their distinct and interrelated components. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of generalized personalized image generation across various generative models, including traditional GANs, contemporary text-to-image diffusion models, and emerging multi-model autoregressive models. We first define a unified framework that standardizes the personalization process across different generative models, encompassing three key components, i.e., inversion spaces, inversion methods, and personalization schemes. This unified framework offers a structured approach to dissecting and comparing personalization techniques across different generative architectures. Building upon this unified framework, we further provide an in-depth analysis of personalization techniques within each generative model, highlighting their unique contributions and innovations. Through comparative analysis, this survey elucidates the current landscape of personalized image generation, identifying commonalities and distinguishing features among existing methods.

Though researchers have recently proposed several methods to achieve this task, most of these techniques derive the target pose directly from the desired target image on a specific dataset, making the underlying process challenging to apply in real-world scenarios as the generation of the target image is the actual aim. In this paper, we first present the shortcomings of current pose transfer algorithms and then propose a novel text-based pose transfer technique to address those issues. We divide the problem into three independent stages: (a) text to pose representation, (b) pose refinement, and (c) pose rendering. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to develop a text-based pose transfer framework where we also introduce a new dataset DF-PASS, by adding descriptive pose annotations for the images of the DeepFashion dataset.

In synthetic brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs), characteristic fissures are often missing, and reconstructed cortical surfaces appear scattered rather than densely convoluted. To address this issue, we introduce Cor2Vox, the first diffusion model-based method that translates continuous cortical shape priors to synthetic brain MRIs. To achieve this, we leverage a Brownian bridge process which allows for direct structured mapping between shape contours and medical images. Specifically, we adapt the concept of the Brownian bridge diffusion model to 3D and extend it to embrace various complementary shape representations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in the geometric accuracy of reconstructed structures compared to previous voxel-based approaches. Moreover, Cor2Vox excels in image quality and diversity, yielding high variation in non-target structures like the skull.

Key components such as the human preference alignment and classifier-free guidance play a crucial role in ensuring generation quality. However, their independent application in current text-to-image models continues to face significant challenges in achieving strong text-image alignment, high generation quality, and consistency with human aesthetic standards. In this work, we for the first time, explore facilitating the collaboration of human performance alignment and test-time sampling to unlock the potential of text-to-image models. Consequently, we introduce CHATS (Combining Human-Aligned optimization and Test-time Sampling), a novel generative framework that separately models the preferred and dispreferred distributions and employs a proxy-prompt-based sampling strategy to utilize the useful information contained in both distributions. We observe that CHATS exhibits exceptional data efficiency, achieving strong performance with only a small, high-quality funetuning dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CHATS surpasses traditional preference alignment methods, setting new state-of-the-art across various standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing work is focused on fully migrating diffusion models to SR tasks. The diffusion model is proposed in the field of image generation, so in order to make the generated results diverse, the diffusion model combines random Gaussian noise and distributed sampling to increase the randomness of the model. However, the essence of super-resolution tasks requires the model to generate high-resolution images with fidelity. Excessive addition of random factors can result in the model generating detailed information that does not belong to the HR image. To address this issue, we propose a new diffusion model called Deltadiff, which uses only residuals between images for diffusion, making the entire diffusion process more stable. The experimental results show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art models and generates results with better fidelity.

To investigate this, we introduce ViLP, a benchmark featuring deliberately out-of-distribution images synthesized via image generation models and out-of-distribution Q&A pairs. Each question in ViLP is coupled with three potential answers and three corresponding images: one that can be resolved by text priors alone and two that demand visual reasoning. Although, humans achieve near-perfect accuracy, modern VLMs falter; for instance, GPT-4 achieves only 66.17% on ViLP. To alleviate this, we propose a self-improving framework in which models generate new VQA data, then apply pixel-level and semantic corruptions to form "good-bad" image pairs for self-training. Our training objectives compel VLMs to focus more on the actual visual inputs, and we demonstrate their effectiveness in boosting the performance of open-source VLMs, including LLaVA-v1.5 and Cambrian.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://huggingface.co/ViLP</p></details> | None |

However, texts and images are usually interconnected, forming a multimodal attributed graph (MMAG). It is underexplored how MLLMs can incorporate the relational information (\textit{i.e.}, graph structure) and semantic information (\textit{i.e.,} texts and images) on such graphs for multimodal comprehension and generation. In this paper, we propose GraphGPT-o, which supports omni-multimodal understanding and creation on MMAGs. We first comprehensively study linearization variants to transform semantic and structural information as input for MLLMs. Then, we propose a hierarchical aligner that enables deep graph encoding, bridging the gap between MMAGs and MLLMs. Finally, we explore the inference choices, adapting MLLM to interleaved text and image generation in graph scenarios. Extensive experiments on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Datasets and codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, model-generated images may exhibit not safe for work (NSFW) content and style copyright infringements. The prompts that result in these problems often do not include explicit unsafe words; instead, they contain obscure and associative terms, which are referred to as implicit unsafe prompts. Existing approaches directly fine-tune models under textual guidance to alter the cognition of the diffusion model, thereby erasing inappropriate concepts. This not only requires concept-specific fine-tuning but may also incur catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we explore the representation of inappropriate concepts in the image space and guide them towards more suitable ones by injecting growth inhibitors, which are tailored based on the identified features related to inappropriate concepts during the diffusion process. Additionally, due to the varying degrees and scopes of inappropriate concepts, we train an adapter to infer the corresponding suppression scale during the injection process. Our method effectively captures the manifestation of subtle words at the image level, enabling direct and efficient erasure of target concepts without the need for fine-tuning. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior erasure results with little effect on other concepts while preserving image quality and semantics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it remains challenging to control the generation process with desired properties (e.g., aesthetic quality, user intention), which can be expressed as black-box reward functions. In this paper, we focus on prompt adaptation, which refines the original prompt into model-preferred prompts to generate desired images. While prior work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize prompts, we observe that applying RL often results in generating similar postfixes and deterministic behaviors. To this end, we introduce \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}daptation with \textbf{G}FlowNets (\textbf{PAG}), a novel approach that frames prompt adaptation as a probabilistic inference problem. Our key insight is that leveraging Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) allows us to shift from reward maximization to sampling from an unnormalized density function, enabling both high-quality and diverse prompt generation. However, we identify that a naive application of GFlowNets suffers from mode collapse and uncovers a previously overlooked phenomenon: the progressive loss of neural plasticity in the model, which is compounded by inefficient credit assignment in sequential prompt generation. To address this critical challenge, we develop a systematic approach in PAG with flow reactivation, reward-prioritized sampling, and reward decomposition for prompt adaptation. Extensive experiments validate that PAG successfully learns to sample effective and diverse prompts for text-to-image generation. We also show that PAG exhibits strong robustness across various reward functions and transferability to different text-to-image models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average.

These systems must navigate a variety of unexpected scenarios on the road, and their complexity poses substantial difficulties for thorough testing. Conventional testing methodologies face critical limitations, including the oracle problem determining whether the systems behavior is correct and the inability to exhaustively recreate a range of situations a self-driving car may encounter. While Metamorphic Testing (MT) offers a partial solution to these challenges, its application is often limited by simplistic modifications to test scenarios. In this position paper, we propose enhancing MT by integrating AI-driven image generation tools, such as Stable Diffusion, to improve testing methodologies. These tools can generate nuanced variations of driving scenarios within the operational design domain (ODD)for example, altering weather conditions, modifying environmental elements, or adjusting lane markings while preserving the critical features necessary for system evaluation. This approach enables reproducible testing, efficient reuse of test criteria, and comprehensive evaluation of a self-driving systems performance across diverse scenarios, thereby addressing key gaps in current testing practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to 1st International Workshop on Software Engineering for Autonomous Driving Systems (SE4ADS 2025) in 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[How to Backdoor Consistency Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19785v3)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency models are a new class of models that generate images by directly mapping noise to data, allowing for one-step generation and significantly accelerating the sampling process. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks has not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we conduct the first study on the vulnerability of consistency models to backdoor attacks. While previous research has explored backdoor attacks on diffusion models, those studies have primarily focused on conventional diffusion models, employing a customized backdoor training process and objective, whereas consistency models have distinct training processes and objectives. Our proposed framework demonstrates the vulnerability of consistency models to backdoor attacks. During image generation, poisoned consistency models produce images with a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) comparable to that of a clean model when sampling from Gaussian noise. However, once the trigger is activated, they generate backdoor target images. We explore various trigger and target configurations to evaluate the vulnerability of consistency models, including the use of random noise as a trigger. This novel trigger is visually inconspicuous, more challenging to detect, and aligns well with the sampling process of consistency models. Across all configurations, our framework successfully compromises the consistency models while maintaining high utility and specificity. We also examine the stealthiness of our proposed attack, which is attributed to the unique properties of consistency models and the elusive nature of the Gaussian noise trigger.

We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI driven content generation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Intent Understanding for Ambiguous Prompts through Human-Machine Co-Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15167v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's image generation systems are capable of producing realistic and high-quality images. However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset. Our annotation tools and several examples of our dataset are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14876029 for easier review.

However, the current ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still suffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function evaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a novel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality generation. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous steps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from the previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to approximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor expansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial interpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could approximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that the flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation speed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom, LSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency of the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from 13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and LSUN-Church, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Not limited to text and images, generative models can generate industrial time series data, addressing challenges such as the difficulty of data collection and data annotation. Due to their outstanding generation ability, they have been widely used in Internet of Things, metaverse, and cyber-physical-social systems to enhance the efficiency of industrial production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of generative models for industrial time series from deep generative models (DGMs) to large generative models (LGMs). First, a DGM-based AIGC framework is proposed for industrial time series generation. Within this framework, we survey advanced industrial DGMs and present a multi-perspective categorization. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the critical technologies required to construct industrial LGMs from four aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex industrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time series, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks.

This paper explores the significant technological shifts since our previous review in 2022, highlighting how these developments have expanded creative opportunities and efficiency. These technological advancements have enhanced the capabilities of text-to-image, text-to-video, and multimodal generation technologies. In particular, key breakthroughs in LLMs have established new benchmarks in conversational AI, while advancements in image generators have revolutionized content creation. We also discuss AI integration into post-production workflows, which has significantly accelerated and refined traditional processes. Despite these innovations, challenges remain, particularly for the media industry, due to the demands on communication traffic from creative content. We therefore include data compression and quality assessment in this paper. Furthermore, we highlight the trend toward unified AI frameworks capable of addressing multiple creative tasks and underscore the importance of human oversight to mitigate AI-generated inaccuracies.

However, text-to-image generation - where images are produced from typed prompts - can be less engaging in public settings since the act of typing tends to limit interactive audience participation, thereby reducing its suitability for designing dynamic public installations. In this article, we explore body prompting as input modality for image generation in the context of installations at public event settings. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform existing artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our semi-structured interviews with a sample of visitors (N = 79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience to the installation's visitors. We present insights into participants' experience of body prompting and AI co-creation and identify three distinct strategies of embodied interaction focused on re-creating, reimagining, or casual interaction. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and public event spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Inversion-based methods rely on time-consuming optimization to preserve the features of the initial images, which results in low efficiency due to the requirement for extensive network inference. Conversely, inversion-free methods lack theoretical support for background similarity, as they circumvent the issue of maintaining initial features to achieve efficiency. As a consequence, none of these methods can achieve both high efficiency and background consistency. To tackle the challenges and the aforementioned disadvantages, we introduce PostEdit, a method that incorporates a posterior scheme to govern the diffusion sampling process. Specifically, a corresponding measurement term related to both the initial features and Langevin dynamics is introduced to optimize the estimated image generated by the given target prompt. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed PostEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance while accurately preserving unedited regions. Furthermore, the method is both inversion- and training-free, necessitating approximately 1.5 seconds and 18 GB of GPU memory to generate high-quality results.</p></details> | 31 pages | None |

While emerging approaches for controlling diffusion models have enabled users to specify the desired spatial layouts of the generated content, they cannot predict or control where viewers will pay more attention due to the complexity of human vision. Recognizing the significance of attention-controllable image generation in practical applications, we present a saliency-guided framework to incorporate the data priors of human visual attention mechanisms into the generation process. Given a user-specified viewer attention distribution, our control module conditions a diffusion model to generate images that attract viewers' attention toward the desired regions. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we performed an eye-tracked user study and a large-scale model-based saliency analysis. The results evidence that both the cross-user eye gaze distributions and the saliency models' predictions align with the desired attention distributions. Lastly, we outline several applications, including interactive design of saliency guidance, attention suppression in unwanted regions, and adaptive generation for varied display/viewing conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Applied Perception (ACM Symposium on Applied Perception 2024)</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we establish convergence guarantees for a general class of SGMs in 2-Wasserstein distance, assuming accurate score estimates and smooth log-concave data distribution. We specialize our result to several concrete SGMs with specific choices of forward processes modelled by stochastic differential equations, and obtain an upper bound on the iteration complexity for each model, which demonstrates the impacts of different choices of the forward processes. We also provide a lower bound when the data distribution is Gaussian. Numerically, we experiment SGMs with different forward processes, some of which are newly proposed in this paper, for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10. We find that the experimental results are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions on the iteration complexity, and the models with our newly proposed forward processes can outperform existing models.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite significant improvements in visual attractiveness for the beautified codes, their scannabilities are usually sacrificed and thus hinder their practical uses in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel training-free Diffusion-based QR Code generator (DiffQRCoder) to effectively craft both scannable and visually pleasing QR codes. The proposed approach introduces Scanning-Robust Perceptual Guidance (SRPG), a new diffusion guidance for Diffusion Models to guarantee the generated aesthetic codes to obey the ground-truth QR codes while maintaining their attractiveness during the denoising process. Additionally, we present another post-processing technique, Scanning Robust Manifold Projected Gradient Descent (SR-MPGD), to further enhance their scanning robustness through iterative latent space optimization. With extensive experiments, the results demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms other compared methods in Scanning Success Rate (SSR) with better or comparable CLIP aesthetic score (CLIP-aes.) but also significantly improves the SSR of the ControlNet-only approach from 60% to 99%. The subjective evaluation indicates that our approach achieves promising visual attractiveness to users as well. Finally, even with different scanning angles and the most rigorous error tolerance settings, our approach robustly achieves over 95% SSR, demonstrating its capability for real-world applications.

There exists a diverse range of deepfake generation techniques, which makes it challenging to develop an accurate universal detection mechanism. The 2025 Signal Processing Cup (DFWild-Cup competition) provided a diverse dataset of deepfake images, which are generated from multiple deepfake image generators, for training machine learning model(s) to emphasize the generalization of deepfake detection. To this end, we proposed an ensemble-based approach that employs three different neural network architectures: a ResNet-34-based architecture, a data-efficient image transformer (DeiT), and an XceptionNet with Wavelet Transform to capture both local and global features of deepfakes. We visualize the specific regions that these models focus for classification using Grad-CAM, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in grouping real and fake images into cohesive clusters using t-SNE plots. Individually, the ResNet-34 architecture has achieved 88.9% accuracy, whereas the Xception network and the DeiT architecture have achieved 87.76% and 89.32% accuracy, respectively. With these networks, our weighted ensemble model achieves an excellent accuracy of 93.23% on the validation dataset of the SP Cup 2025 competition. Finally, the confusion matrix and an Area Under the ROC curve of 97.44% further confirm the stability of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in Elsevier Image and Vision Computing</p></details> | None |

However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect demanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual relationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but overlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for downstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address this gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses realism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes, unusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho score of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility in ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like image captioning, classification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that high-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image classification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to 4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions, providing insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this advancement raises significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and the potential misuse of generated content. Current watermarking techniques employed in LDMs often embed constant signals to the generated images that compromise their stealthiness, making them vulnerable to detection by malicious attackers. In this paper, we introduce SWA-LDM, a novel approach that enhances watermarking by randomizing the embedding process, effectively eliminating detectable patterns while preserving image quality and robustness. Our proposed watermark presence attack reveals the inherent vulnerabilities of existing latent-based watermarking methods, demonstrating how easily these can be exposed. Through comprehensive experiments, we validate that SWA-LDM not only fortifies watermark stealthiness but also maintains competitive performance in watermark robustness and visual fidelity. This work represents a pivotal step towards securing LDM-generated images against unauthorized use, ensuring both copyright protection and content integrity in an era where digital image authenticity is paramount.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures | None |

To address this, researchers have sought improved goal representations derived from natural language. In this paper, we highlight 3D flow - representing the motion trend of 3D particles within a scene - as an effective bridge between language-based future image generation and fine-grained action prediction. To this end, we develop ManiTrend, a unified framework that models the dynamics of 3D particles, vision observations and manipulation actions with a causal transformer. Within this framework, features for 3D flow prediction serve as additional conditions for future image generation and action prediction, alleviating the complexity of pixel-wise spatiotemporal modeling and providing seamless action guidance. Furthermore, 3D flow can substitute missing or heterogeneous action labels during large-scale pretraining on cross-embodiment demonstrations.

With a small set of user-provided examples, PCS aims to customize the subject of interest to specific user-defined prompts. Over the past two years, more than 150 methods have been proposed. However, existing surveys mainly focus on text-to-image generation, with few providing up-to-date summaries on PCS. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of PCS, with a particular focus on the diffusion models. Specifically, we introduce the generic frameworks of PCS research, which can be broadly classified into optimization-based and learning-based approaches. We further categorize and analyze these methodologies, discussing their strengths, limitations, and key techniques. Additionally, we delve into specialized tasks within the field, such as personalized object generation, face synthesis, and style personalization, highlighting their unique challenges and innovations. Despite encouraging progress, we also present an analysis of the challenges such as overfitting and the trade-off between subject fidelity and text alignment.

We introduce CellFlow, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlow models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlow generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlow enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics.

However, current methods transform a general unimodal noise distribution to a specific mode of the target data distribution. As such, every point in the initial source distribution can be mapped to every point in the target distribution, resulting in long average paths. To this end, in this work, we tap into a non-utilized property of conditional flow-based models: the ability to design a non-trivial prior distribution. Given an input condition, such as a text prompt, we first map it to a point lying in data space, representing an ``average" data point with the minimal average distance to all data points of the same conditional mode (e.g., class). We then utilize the flow matching formulation to map samples from a parametric distribution centered around this point to the conditional target distribution. Experimentally, our method significantly improves training times and generation efficiency (FID, KID and CLIP alignment scores) compared to baselines, producing high quality samples using fewer sampling steps.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Redistribute Ensemble Training for Mitigating Memorization in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09434v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, known for their tremendous ability to generate high-quality samples, have recently raised concerns due to their data memorization behavior, which poses privacy risks. Recent methods for memory mitigation have primarily addressed the issue within the context of the text modality in cross-modal generation tasks, restricting their applicability to specific conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for diffusion models from the perspective of visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating memorization. Directly exposing visual data to the model increases memorization risk, so we design a framework where models learn through proxy model parameters instead. Specially, the training dataset is divided into multiple shards, with each shard training a proxy model, then aggregated to form the final model. Additionally, practical analysis of training losses illustrates that the losses for easily memorable images tend to be obviously lower. Thus, we skip the samples with abnormally low loss values from the current mini-batch to avoid memorizing. However, balancing the need to skip memorization-prone samples while maintaining sufficient training data for high-quality image generation presents a key challenge. Thus, we propose IET-AGC+, which redistributes highly memorizable samples between shards, to mitigate these samples from over-skipping. Furthermore, we dynamically augment samples based on their loss values to further reduce memorization. Extensive experiments and analysis on four datasets show that our method successfully reduces memory capacity while maintaining performance. Moreover, we fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, and decrease the memorization score by 46.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

However, they struggle to generate rare or unseen concepts. To address this challenge, we explore the usage of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with image generation models. We propose ImageRAG, a method that dynamically retrieves relevant images based on a given text prompt, and uses them as context to guide the generation process. Prior approaches that used retrieved images to improve generation, trained models specifically for retrieval-based generation. In contrast, ImageRAG leverages the capabilities of existing image conditioning models, and does not require RAG-specific training. Our approach is highly adaptable and can be applied across different model types, showing significant improvement in generating rare and fine-grained concepts using different base models.

The rise of web-based apps and mobile devices has provided valuable user data for mobility-related research. However, real-world mobility data is costly and raises privacy concerns. To protect privacy while retaining key features of real-world movement, the demand for synthetic data has steadily increased. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for mobility trajectory generation due to their ability to model randomness and uncertainty. However, existing approaches often directly apply identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise sampling from image generation techniques, which fail to account for the spatiotemporal correlations and social interactions that shape urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose CoDiffMob, a diffusion model for urban mobility generation with collaborative noise priors, we emphasize the critical role of noise in diffusion models for generating mobility data. By leveraging both individual movement characteristics and population-wide dynamics, we construct novel collaborative noise priors that provide richer and more informative guidance throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, with generated data accurately capturing both individual preferences and collective patterns, achieving an improvement of over 32%. Furthermore, it can effectively replace web-derived mobility data to better support downstream applications, while safeguarding user privacy and fostering a more secure and ethical web. This highlights its tremendous potential for applications in sustainable city-related research.

In this paper, we conduct a detailed comparison of the two on a sentence comprehension task using garden-path constructions, which are notoriously challenging for humans. Based on psycholinguistic research, we formulate hypotheses on why garden-path sentences are hard, and test these hypotheses on human participants and a large suite of LLMs using comprehension questions. Our findings reveal that both LLMs and humans struggle with specific syntactic complexities, with some models showing high correlation with human comprehension. To complement our findings, we test LLM comprehension of garden-path constructions with paraphrasing and text-to-image generation tasks, and find that the results mirror the sentence comprehension question results, further validating our findings on LLM understanding of these constructions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sequential Covariance Fitting for InSAR Phase Linking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09248v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Phase-Linking (PL) algorithms are known for their high cost, especially with the huge volume of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images generated by Sentinel-1 SAR missions. Recently, a COvariance Fitting Interferometric Phase Linking (COFI-PL) approach has been proposed, which can be seen as a generic framework for existing PL methods. Although this method is less computationally expensive than traditional PL approaches, COFI-PL exploits the entire covariance matrix, which poses a challenge with the increasing time series of SAR images. However, COFI-PL, like traditional PL approaches, cannot accommodate the efficient inclusion of newly acquired SAR images. This paper overcomes this drawback by introducing a sequential integration of a block of newly acquired SAR images. Specifically, we propose a method for effectively addressing optimization problems associated with phase-only complex vectors on the torus based on the Majorization-Minimization framework.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite these advancements, VLM still faces explainable problems to user in diagnosis due to the inherent complexity of dermatological conditions, existing tools offer relatively limited support for user comprehension. We propose SkinGEN, a diagnosis-to-generation framework that leverages the stable diffusion(SD) model to generate reference demonstrations from diagnosis results provided by VLM, thereby enhancing the visual explainability for users. Through extensive experiments with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we identify optimal strategies for skin condition image generation. We conduct a user study with 32 participants evaluating both the system performance and explainability. Results demonstrate that SkinGEN significantly improves users' comprehension of VLM predictions and fosters increased trust in the diagnostic process. This work paves the way for more transparent and user-centric VLM applications in dermatology and beyond.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Detecting Malicious Concepts Without Image Generation in AIGC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08921v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of text-to-image generation has achieved tremendous success in practice, with emerging concept generation models capable of producing highly personalized and customized content. Fervor for concept generation is increasing rapidly among users, and platforms for concept sharing have sprung up. The concept owners may upload malicious concepts and disguise them with non-malicious text descriptions and example images to deceive users into downloading and generating malicious content. The platform needs a quick method to determine whether a concept is malicious to prevent the spread of malicious concepts. However, simply relying on concept image generation to judge whether a concept is malicious requires time and computational resources. Especially, as the number of concepts uploaded and downloaded on the platform continues to increase, this approach becomes impractical and poses a risk of generating malicious content. In this paper, we propose Concept QuickLook, the first systematic work to incorporate malicious concept detection into research, which performs detection based solely on concept files without generating any images. We define malicious concepts and design two work modes for detection: concept matching and fuzzy detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Concept QuickLook can detect malicious concepts and demonstrate practicality in concept sharing platforms. We also design robustness experiments to further validate the effectiveness of the solution. We hope this work can initiate malicious concept detection tasks and provide some inspiration.</p></details> |  | None |

Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

However, the creation of high-quality annotated datasets for training remains a major challenge. This study introduces a novel single-stage approach (HistoSmith) for generating image-label pairs to augment histology datasets. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with separate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a latent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts, classification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data generation by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types, quantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset and the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and diverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell instance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented cell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Diffusion Models Efficiency by Disentangling Total-Variance and Signal-to-Noise Ratio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08598v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long sampling time of diffusion models remains a significant bottleneck, which can be mitigated by reducing the number of diffusion time steps. However, the quality of samples with fewer steps is highly dependent on the noise schedule, i.e., the specific manner in which noise is introduced and the signal is reduced at each step. Although prior work has improved upon the original variance-preserving and variance-exploding schedules, these approaches $\textit{passively}$ adjust the total variance, without direct control over it. In this work, we propose a novel total-variance/signal-to-noise-ratio disentangled (TV/SNR) framework, where TV and SNR can be controlled independently. Our approach reveals that different existing schedules, where the TV explodes exponentially, can be $\textit{improved}$ by setting a constant TV schedule while preserving the same SNR schedule. Furthermore, generalizing the SNR schedule of the optimal transport flow matching significantly improves the performance in molecular structure generation, achieving few step generation of stable molecules. A similar tendency is observed in image generation, where our approach with a uniform diffusion time grid performs comparably to the highly tailored EDM sampler.</p></details> |  | None |

Image generation has immense potential in medical imaging because open-source medical images are difficult to obtain compared to natural images, especially for rare conditions. The generated images can be used later to train classification and segmentation models. In this paper, we propose simulating realistic ultrasound (US) images by successive fine-tuning of large diffusion models on different publicly available databases. To do so, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, on BUSI (Breast US Images) an ultrasound breast image dataset. We successfully generated high-quality US images of the breast using simple prompts that specify the organ and pathology, which appeared realistic to three experienced US scientists and a US radiologist. Additionally, we provided user control by conditioning the model with segmentations through ControlNet. We will release the source code at http://code.sonography.ai/ to allow fast US image generation to the scientific community.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages conference paper for SPIE medical imaging</p></details> | None |

However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), which uses a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to improve the accuracy of generated black hole images based on seven physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. This approach reduces computational costs and provides a faster, more efficient method for dataset expansion, parameter estimation, and model fitting.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Skrr: Skip and Re-use Text Encoder Layers for Memory Efficient Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08690v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text encoders in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. Unlike denoising modules that rely on multiple iterative steps, text encoders require only a single forward pass to produce text embeddings. However, despite their minimal contribution to total inference time and floating-point operations (FLOPs), text encoders demand significantly higher memory usage, up to eight times more than denoising modules. To address this inefficiency, we propose Skip and Re-use layers (Skrr), a simple yet effective pruning strategy specifically designed for text encoders in T2I diffusion models. Skrr exploits the inherent redundancy in transformer blocks by selectively skipping or reusing certain layers in a manner tailored for T2I tasks, thereby reducing memory consumption without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skrr maintains image quality comparable to the original model even under high sparsity levels, outperforming existing blockwise pruning methods. Furthermore, Skrr achieves state-of-the-art memory efficiency while preserving performance across multiple evaluation metrics, including the FID, CLIP, DreamSim, and GenEval scores.</p></details> |  | None |

The generation of skills is a challenging endeavor, but its successful implementation could greatly facilitate human skill learning and provide more experience for embodied intelligence. Although current video generation models can synthesis simple and atomic human operations, they struggle with human skills due to their complex procedure process. Human skills involve multi-step, long-duration actions and complex scene transitions, so the existing naive auto-regressive methods for synthesizing long videos cannot generate human skills. To address this, we propose a novel task, the Key-step Skill Generation (KS-Gen), aimed at reducing the complexity of generating human skill videos. Given the initial state and a skill description, the task is to generate video clips of key steps to complete the skill, rather than a full-length video. To support this task, we introduce a carefully curated dataset and define multiple evaluation metrics to assess performance. Considering the complexity of KS-Gen, we propose a new framework for this task. First, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) generates descriptions for key steps using retrieval argument. Subsequently, we use a Key-step Image Generator (KIG) to address the discontinuity between key steps in skill videos. Finally, a video generation model uses these descriptions and key-step images to generate video clips of the key steps with high temporal consistency. We offer a detailed analysis of the results, hoping to provide more insights on human skill generation.

Is it possible to automatically generate such images using only basic product information--specifically, a product foreground image, taglines, and a target size? Existing methods mainly focus on parts of the problem and fail to provide a comprehensive solution. To address this gap, we propose a novel multistage framework called Product-Centric Advertising Image Design (PAID). It consists of four sequential stages to highlight product foregrounds and taglines while achieving overall image aesthetics: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Different expert models are designed and trained for the first three stages: First, we use a visual language model (VLM) to generate background prompts that match the products. Next, a VLM-based layout generation model arranges the placement of product foregrounds, graphic elements (taglines and decorative underlays), and various nongraphic elements (objects from the background prompt). Following this, we train an SDXL-based image generation model that can simultaneously accept prompts, layouts, and foreground controls. To support the PAID framework, we create corresponding datasets with over 50,000 labeled images. Extensive experimental results and online A/B tests demonstrate that PAID can produce more visually appealing advertising images.</p></details> |  | None |

Although several anti-personalization techniques have been developed, these methods typically assume that defenders can afford to design a privacy cloak corresponding to each specific image. However, due to extensive personal images shared online, image-specific methods are limited by real-world practical applications. To address this issue, we are the first to investigate the creation of identity-specific cloaks (ID-Cloak) that safeguard all images belong to a specific identity. Specifically, we first model an identity subspace that preserves personal commonalities and learns diverse contexts to capture the image distribution to be protected. Then, we craft identity-specific cloaks with the proposed novel objective that encourages the cloak to guide the model away from its normal output within the subspace. Extensive experiments show that the generated universal cloak can effectively protect the images. We believe our method, along with the proposed identity-specific cloak setting, marks a notable advance in realistic privacy protection.</p></details> |  | None |

In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as a valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 15 figures.

Our method, Direct Ascent Synthesis (DAS), reveals these latent capabilities through multi-resolution optimization of CLIP model representations. While traditional inversion attempts produce adversarial patterns, DAS achieves high-quality image synthesis by decomposing optimization across multiple spatial scales (1x1 to 224x224), requiring no additional training. This approach not only enables diverse applications -- from text-to-image generation to style transfer -- but maintains natural image statistics ($1/f^2$ spectrum) and guides the generation away from non-robust adversarial patterns. Our results demonstrate that standard discriminative models encode substantially richer generative knowledge than previously recognized, providing new perspectives on model interpretability and the relationship between adversarial examples and natural image synthesis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures | None |

Existing methods for such integration have limited performance, with structural similarity often below 60\%, We attribute this limitation to the failure to consider causal relationships between genes. We present CausalGeD, which combines diffusion and autoregressive processes to leverage these relationships. By generalizing the Causal Attention Transformer from image generation to gene expression data, our model captures regulatory mechanisms without predefined relationships. Across 10 tissue datasets, CausalGeD outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 5- 32\% in key metrics, including Pearson's correlation and structural similarity, advancing both technical and biological insights.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Not All Prompts Are Made Equal: Prompt-based Pruning of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12042v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive image generation capabilities. Still, their computational intensity prohibits resource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning them on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential solution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning methods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the varying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses this issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents batch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive Prompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed for T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model, which learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the prompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train the prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring that similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal transport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one. We demonstrate APTP's effectiveness by pruning Stable Diffusion (SD) V2.1 using CC3M and COCO as target datasets. APTP outperforms the single-model pruning baselines in terms of FID, CLIP, and CMMD scores. Our analysis of the clusters learned by APTP reveals they are semantically meaningful. We also show that APTP can automatically discover previously empirically found challenging prompts for SD, e.g. prompts for generating text images, assigning them to higher capacity codes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Image-to-Image Diffusion Classifier for Adversarial Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08502v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated great potential in the field of adversarial robustness, where DM-based defense methods can achieve superior defense capability without adversarial training. However, they all require huge computational costs due to the usage of large-scale pre-trained DMs, making it difficult to conduct full evaluation under strong attacks and compare with traditional CNN-based methods. Simply reducing the network size and timesteps in DMs could significantly harm the image generation quality, which invalidates previous frameworks. To alleviate this issue, we redesign the diffusion framework from generating high-quality images to predicting distinguishable image labels. Specifically, we employ an image translation framework to learn many-to-one mapping from input samples to designed orthogonal image labels. Based on this framework, we introduce an efficient Image-to-Image diffusion classifier with a pruned U-Net structure and reduced diffusion timesteps. Besides the framework, we redesign the optimization objective of DMs to fit the target of image classification, where a new classification loss is incorporated in the DM-based image translation framework to distinguish the generated label from those of other classes. We conduct sufficient evaluations of the proposed classifier under various attacks on popular benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better adversarial robustness with fewer computational costs than DM-based and CNN-based methods.

Efforts have been devoted to improving model controls with prompt tuning and spatial conditioning. However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users' rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.</p></details> | conference: CHI2025 | None |

We hypothesize that this memorization stems from the overparameterization of deep models and propose that regularizing model capacity during fine-tuning can mitigate this issue. Firstly, we empirically show that regulating the model capacity via Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mitigates memorization to some extent, however, it further requires the identification of the exact parameter subsets to be fine-tuned for high-quality generation. To identify these subsets, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework, MemControl, that automates parameter selection using memorization and generation quality metrics as rewards during fine-tuning. The parameter subsets discovered through MemControl achieve a superior tradeoff between generation quality and memorization. For the task of medical image generation, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art memorization mitigation strategies by fine-tuning as few as 0.019% of model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the discovered parameter subsets are transferable to non-medical domains. Our framework is scalable to large datasets, agnostic to reward functions, and can be integrated with existing approaches for further memorization mitigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically evaluate memorization in medical images and propose a targeted yet universal mitigation strategy.

In response, several protection tools against style mimicry have been developed that incorporate small adversarial perturbations into artworks published online. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of popular protections -- with millions of downloads -- and show they only provide a false sense of security. We find that low-effort and "off-the-shelf" techniques, such as image upscaling, are sufficient to create robust mimicry methods that significantly degrade existing protections. Through a user study, we demonstrate that all existing protections can be easily bypassed, leaving artists vulnerable to style mimicry. We caution that tools based on adversarial perturbations cannot reliably protect artists from the misuse of generative AI, and urge the development of alternative non-technological solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these advances are hindered by two main challenges: firstly, the need to accurately maintain the details of each referenced subject in accordance with the textual descriptions; and secondly, the difficulty in achieving a cohesive representation of multiple subjects in a single image without introducing inconsistencies. To address these concerns, our research introduces the MS-Diffusion framework for layout-guided zero-shot image personalization with multi-subjects. This innovative approach integrates grounding tokens with the feature resampler to maintain detail fidelity among subjects. With the layout guidance, MS-Diffusion further improves the cross-attention to adapt to the multi-subject inputs, ensuring that each subject condition acts on specific areas. The proposed multi-subject cross-attention orchestrates harmonious inter-subject compositions while preserving the control of texts. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm that this method surpasses existing models in both image and text fidelity, promoting the development of personalized text-to-image generation.

Existing methods either require identical head counts or introduce projectors to bridge dimensional gaps, limiting flexibility and efficiency. We propose Squeezing-Heads Distillation (SHD), a novel approach that enables seamless knowledge transfer between models with varying head counts by compressing multi-head attention maps via efficient linear approximation. Unlike prior work, SHD eliminates alignment barriers without additional parameters or architectural modifications. Our method dynamically approximates the combined effect of multiple teacher heads into fewer student heads, preserving fine-grained attention patterns while reducing redundancy. Experiments across language (LLaMA, GPT) and vision (DiT, MDT) generative and vision (DeiT) discriminative tasks demonstrate SHD's effectiveness: it outperforms logit-based and feature-alignment KD baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in image classification, image generation language fine-tuning, and language pre-training. The key innovations of flexible head compression, projector-free design, and linear-time complexity make SHD a versatile and scalable solution for distilling modern transformers.

In recent years, the availability of customer-level 360 cameras has made omnidirectional vision more popular, and the advance of deep learning (DL) has significantly sparked its research and applications. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review and analysis of the recent progress of DL for omnidirectional vision. It delineates the distinct challenges and complexities encountered in applying DL to omnidirectional images as opposed to traditional perspective imagery. Our work covers four main contents: (i) A thorough introduction to the principles of omnidirectional imaging and commonly explored projections of ODI; (ii) A methodical review of varied representation learning approaches tailored for ODI; (iii) An in-depth investigation of optimization strategies specific to omnidirectional vision; (iv) A structural and hierarchical taxonomy of the DL methods for the representative omnidirectional vision tasks, from visual enhancement (e.g., image generation and super-resolution) to 3D geometry and motion estimation (e.g., depth and optical flow estimation), alongside the discussions on emergent research directions; (v) An overview of cutting-edge applications (e.g., autonomous driving and virtual reality), coupled with a critical discussion on prevailing challenges and open questions, to trigger more research in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 24 figures, accepted by IJCV</p></details> | None |
| **[Denoising Task Difficulty-based Curriculum for Training Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10348v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools in the realm of generative modeling. Despite extensive research on denoising across various timesteps and noise levels, a conflict persists regarding the relative difficulties of the denoising tasks. While various studies argue that lower timesteps present more challenging tasks, others contend that higher timesteps are more difficult. To address this conflict, our study undertakes a comprehensive examination of task difficulties, focusing on convergence behavior and changes in relative entropy between consecutive probability distributions across timesteps. Our observational study reveals that denoising at earlier timesteps poses challenges characterized by slower convergence and higher relative entropy, indicating increased task difficulty at these lower timesteps. Building on these observations, we introduce an easy-to-hard learning scheme, drawing from curriculum learning, to enhance the training process of diffusion models. By organizing timesteps or noise levels into clusters and training models with ascending orders of difficulty, we facilitate an order-aware training regime, progressing from easier to harder denoising tasks, thereby deviating from the conventional approach of training diffusion models simultaneously across all timesteps. Our approach leads to improved performance and faster convergence by leveraging benefits of curriculum learning, while maintaining orthogonality with existing improvements in diffusion training techniques. We validate these advantages through comprehensive experiments in image generation tasks, including unconditional, class-conditional, and text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day video diffusion to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current video diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. We show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predict 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 16 pages</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a method to automatically and actively select the small amount of additional data required for the continuous training of deepfake detection models in situations where deepfake detection models are regularly updated. The proposed method automatically selects new training data from a \textit{redundant} pool set containing a large number of images generated by new deepfake methods and real images, using the confidence score of the deepfake detection model as a metric. Experimental results show that the deepfake detection model, continuously trained with a small amount of additional data automatically selected and added to the original training set, significantly and efficiently improved the detection performance, achieving an EER of 2.5% with only 15% of the amount of data in the pool set.</p></details> |  | None |

Current research usually focuses on single species and small datasets due to limitations in phenotypic data collection, especially for traits that require visual assessments or physical measurements. Deciphering complex and composite phenotypes, such as morphology, from genetic data at scale remains an open question. To break through traditional generic models that rely on simplified assumptions, this paper introduces G2PDiffusion, the first-of-its-kind diffusion model designed for genotype-to-phenotype generation across multiple species. Specifically, we use images to represent morphological phenotypes across species and redefine phenotype prediction as conditional image generation. To this end, this paper introduces an environment-enhanced DNA sequence conditioner and trains a stable diffusion model with a novel alignment method to improve genotype-to-phenotype consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances phenotype prediction accuracy across species, capturing subtle genetic variations that contribute to observable traits.</p></details> |  | None |

Although integrating diffusion models with preference alignment strategies poses significant challenges for novices at this intersection, comprehensive and systematic reviews of this subject are still notably lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper extensively surveys preference alignment with diffusion models in image generation and editing. First, we systematically review cutting-edge optimization techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), and others, highlighting their pivotal role in aligning preferences with DMs. Then, we thoroughly explore the applications of aligning preferences with DMs in autonomous driving, medical imaging, robotics, and more. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the challenges of preference alignment with DMs. To our knowledge, this is the first survey centered on preference alignment with DMs, providing insights to drive future innovation in this dynamic area.</p></details> |  | None |

However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. The synthetic images are validated by expert clinicians for alignment with their corresponding text prompts. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the synthetic images against the real images confirms that our model synthesizes novel images and, crucially, may preserve patient privacy. Finally, classifiers trained on a mixture of synthetic and real data achieve similar performance to those trained on twice the amount of real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential for generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p></details> |  | None |

This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Outsourced diffusion sampling: Efficient posterior inference in latent spaces of generative models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06999v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any well-behaved generative model over a variable $\mathbf{x}$ can be expressed as a deterministic transformation of an exogenous ('outsourced') Gaussian noise variable $\mathbf{z}$: $\mathbf{x}=f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$. In such a model (e.g., a VAE, GAN, or continuous-time flow-based model), sampling of the target variable $\mathbf{x} \sim p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is straightforward, but sampling from a posterior distribution of the form $p(\mathbf{x}\mid\mathbf{y}) \propto p_\theta(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where $r$ is a constraint function depending on an auxiliary variable $\mathbf{y}$, is generally intractable. We propose to amortize the cost of sampling from such posterior distributions with diffusion models that sample a distribution in the noise space ($\mathbf{z}$). These diffusion samplers are trained by reinforcement learning algorithms to enforce that the transformed samples $f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$ are distributed according to the posterior in the data space ($\mathbf{x}$). For many models and constraints of interest, the posterior in the noise space is smoother than the posterior in the data space, making it more amenable to such amortized inference. Our method enables conditional sampling under unconditional GAN, (H)VAE, and flow-based priors, comparing favorably both with current amortized and non-amortized inference methods. We demonstrate the proposed outsourced diffusion sampling in several experiments with large pretrained prior models: conditional image generation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and protein structure generation.</p></details> |  | None |

A common approach involves jointly generating a series of overlapped image patches and obtaining large images by merging adjacent patches. However, results from existing methods often exhibit noticeable artifacts, e.g., seams and inconsistent objects and styles. To address the issues, we proposed Guided Fusion (GF), which mitigates the negative impact from distant image regions by applying a weighted average to the overlapping regions. Moreover, we proposed Variance-Corrected Fusion (VCF), which corrects data variance at post-averaging, generating more accurate fusion for the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Furthermore, we proposed a one-shot Style Alignment (SA), which generates a coherent style for large images by adjusting the initial input noise without adding extra computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed fusion methods improved the quality of the generated image significantly. The proposed method can be widely applied as a plug-and-play module to enhance other fusion-based methods for large image generation.

Several layout-to-image models have been developed to control the generation process by utilizing a wide range of layouts, such as segmentation maps, edges, and human keypoints. In this work, we propose ObjectDiffusion, a model that conditions T2I diffusion models on semantic and spatial grounding information, enabling the precise rendering and placement of desired objects in specific locations defined by bounding boxes. To achieve this, we make substantial modifications to the network architecture introduced in ControlNet to integrate it with the grounding method proposed in GLIGEN. We fine-tune ObjectDiffusion on the COCO2017 training dataset and evaluate it on the COCO2017 validation dataset. Our model improves the precision and quality of controllable image generation, achieving an AP$_{\text{50}}$ of 46.6, an AR of 44.5, and an FID of 19.8, outperforming the current SOTA model trained on open-source datasets across all three metrics. ObjectDiffusion demonstrates a distinctive capability in synthesizing diverse, high-quality, high-fidelity images that seamlessly conform to the semantic and spatial control layout. Evaluated in qualitative and quantitative tests, ObjectDiffusion exhibits remarkable grounding capabilities in closed-set and open-set vocabulary settings across a wide variety of contexts. The qualitative assessment verifies the ability of ObjectDiffusion to generate multiple detailed objects in varying sizes, forms, and locations.</p></details> |  | None |

Current datasets for training and evaluating these methods are limited in scale and diversity. To address this, we propose a methodology for creating high-quality inpainting datasets and apply it to create DiQuID, comprising over 95,000 inpainted images generated from 78,000 original images sourced from MS-COCO, RAISE, and OpenImages. Our methodology consists of three components: (1) Semantically Aligned Object Replacement (SAOR) that identifies suitable objects through instance segmentation and generates contextually appropriate prompts, (2) Multiple Model Image Inpainting (MMII) that employs various state-of-the-art inpainting pipelines primarily based on diffusion models to create diverse manipulations, and (3) Uncertainty-Guided Deceptiveness Assessment (UGDA) that evaluates image realism through comparative analysis with originals. The resulting dataset surpasses existing ones in diversity, aesthetic quality, and technical quality. We provide comprehensive benchmarking results using state-of-the-art forgery detection methods, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in evaluating and improving detection algorithms. Through a human study with 42 participants on 1,000 images, we show that while humans struggle with images classified as deceiving by our methodology, models trained on our dataset maintain high performance on these challenging cases.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we focus on the problem of image hallucination, where images created by generation models fail to faithfully depict factual content. To address this, we introduce I-HallA (Image Hallucination evaluation with Question Answering), a novel automated evaluation metric that measures the factuality of generated images through visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce I-HallA v1.0, a curated benchmark dataset for this purpose. As part of this process, we develop a pipeline that generates high-quality question-answer pairs using multiple GPT-4 Omni-based agents, with human judgments to ensure accuracy. Our evaluation protocols measure image hallucination by testing if images from existing TTI models can correctly respond to these questions. The I-HallA v1.0 dataset comprises 1.2K diverse image-text pairs across nine categories with 1,000 rigorously curated questions covering various compositional challenges. We evaluate five TTI models using I-HallA and reveal that these state-of-the-art models often fail to accurately convey factual information. Moreover, we validate the reliability of our metric by demonstrating a strong Spearman correlation ($\rho$=0.95) with human judgments. We believe our benchmark dataset and metric can serve as a foundation for developing factually accurate TTI generation models.

However, our understanding of cross-attention layers remains somewhat limited. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic interpretability approach for diffusion models by constructing Head Relevance Vectors (HRVs) that align with human-specified visual concepts. An HRV for a given visual concept has a length equal to the total number of cross-attention heads, with each element representing the importance of the corresponding head for the given visual concept. To validate HRVs as interpretable features, we develop an ordered weakening analysis that demonstrates their effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose concept strengthening and concept adjusting methods and apply them to enhance three visual generative tasks. Our results show that HRVs can reduce misinterpretations of polysemous words in image generation, successfully modify five challenging attributes in image editing, and mitigate catastrophic neglect in multi-concept generation.

VAR represents a big step toward generating images using a novel, scalable, coarse-to-fine ``next-scale prediction'' framework. These models set a new quality bar, outperforming all previous methods, including Diffusion Transformers, while having state-of-the-art performance for image synthesis tasks. Our primary contributions establish that, for single-head VAR transformers with a single self-attention layer and single interpolation layer, the VAR Transformer is universal. From the statistical perspective, we prove that such simple VAR transformers are universal approximators for any image-to-image Lipschitz functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that flow-based autoregressive transformers inherit similar approximation capabilities. Our results provide important design principles for effective and computationally efficient VAR Transformer strategies that can be used to extend their utility to more sophisticated VAR models in image generation and other related areas.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding.

However, fine-tuning continuous flow-based generative models to align with arbitrary user-defined reward functions remains challenging, particularly due to issues such as policy collapse from overoptimization and the prohibitively high computational cost of likelihoods in continuous-time flows. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use and theoretically sound RL fine-tuning method, which we term Online Reward-Weighted Conditional Flow Matching with Wasserstein-2 Regularization (ORW-CFM-W2). Our method integrates RL into the flow matching framework to fine-tune generative models with arbitrary reward functions, without relying on gradients of rewards or filtered datasets. By introducing an online reward-weighting mechanism, our approach guides the model to prioritize high-reward regions in the data manifold. To prevent policy collapse and maintain diversity, we incorporate Wasserstein-2 (W2) distance regularization into our method and derive a tractable upper bound for it in flow matching, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation of policy optimization. We provide theoretical analyses to demonstrate the convergence properties and induced data distributions of our method, establishing connections with traditional RL algorithms featuring Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and learning behavior of our approach. Extensive experiments on tasks including target image generation, image compression, and text-image alignment demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where our method achieves optimal policy convergence while allowing controllable trade-offs between reward maximization and diversity preservation.</p></details> | 61 pages | None |

This success extends to food imagery, where various conditional inputs like cooking styles, ingredients, and recipes are utilized. However, a yet-unexplored challenge is generating a sequence of procedural images based on cooking steps from a recipe. This could enhance the cooking experience with visual guidance and possibly lead to an intelligent cooking simulation system. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel task called \textbf{cooking procedural image generation}. This task is inherently demanding, as it strives to create photo-realistic images that align with cooking steps while preserving sequential consistency. To collectively tackle these challenges, we present \textbf{CookingDiffusion}, a novel approach that leverages Stable Diffusion and three innovative Memory Nets to model procedural prompts. These prompts encompass text prompts (representing cooking steps), image prompts (corresponding to cooking images), and multi-modal prompts (mixing cooking steps and images), ensuring the consistent generation of cooking procedural images. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we preprocess the YouCookII dataset, establishing a new benchmark. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model excels at generating high-quality cooking procedural images with remarkable consistency across sequential cooking steps, as measured by both the FID and the proposed Average Procedure Consistency metrics.

Balancing the fidelity of the learned concept with its ability for generation in various contexts presents a significant challenge.

We also provide a tokenizer pre-trained on large-scale data, significantly outperforming Cosmos on zero-shot benchmarks (1.93 vs. 0.78 rFID on ImageNet original resolution). Furthermore, we explore its application in plain auto-regressive models to validate scalability properties, producing a family of auto-regressive image generation models ranging from 300M to 1.5B. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce ``next sub-token prediction'' to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. We release all models and codes to foster innovation and creativity in the field of auto-regressive visual generation.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we develop a mathematical framework based on a low-dimensional data model and posterior estimation, revealing a fundamental trade-off between generation and representation quality near the final stage of image generation. Our analysis explains the unimodal representation dynamics across noise scales, mainly driven by the interplay between data denoising and class specification. Building on these insights, we propose an ensemble method that aggregates features across noise levels, significantly improving both clean performance and robustness under label noise. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> | None |

However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation process, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. To overcome this, we introduce a data-free guided distillation method that enables the efficient distillation of pretrained Stable Diffusion models without access to the real training data, often restricted due to legal, privacy, or cost concerns. This method enhances Score identity Distillation (SiD) with Long and Short Classifier-Free Guidance (LSG), an innovative strategy that applies Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) not only to the evaluation of the pretrained diffusion model but also to the training and evaluation of the fake score network. We optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss using a score-identity-based approximation alongside our proposed guidance strategies for practical computation. By exclusively training with synthetic images generated by its one-step generator, our data-free distillation method rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Notably, the one-step distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves an FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, a record low value under the data-free setting.

AiM employs Mamba, a novel state-space model characterized by its exceptional performance for long-sequence modeling with linear time complexity, to supplant the commonly utilized Transformers in AR image generation models, aiming to achieve both superior generation quality and enhanced inference speed. Unlike existing methods that adapt Mamba to handle two-dimensional signals via multi-directional scan, AiM directly utilizes the next-token prediction paradigm for autoregressive image generation. This approach circumvents the need for extensive modifications to enable Mamba to learn 2D spatial representations. By implementing straightforward yet strategically targeted modifications for visual generative tasks, we preserve Mamba's core structure, fully exploiting its efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities and scalability. We provide AiM models in various scales, with parameter counts ranging from 148M to 1.3B. On the ImageNet1K 256*256 benchmark, our best AiM model achieves a FID of 2.21, surpassing all existing AR models of comparable parameter counts and demonstrating significant competitiveness against diffusion models, with 2 to 10 times faster inference speed.

Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

The inference of Show-o involves progressively denoising image tokens and autoregressively decoding text tokens, and hence, unfortunately, suffers from inefficiency issues from both sides. This paper introduces Show-o Turbo to bridge the gap. We first identify a unified denoising perspective for the generation of images and text in Show-o based on the parallel decoding of text tokens. We then propose to extend consistency distillation (CD), a qualified approach for shortening the denoising process of diffusion models, to the multimodal denoising trajectories of Show-o. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy and a curriculum learning procedure to improve the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation, Show-o Turbo displays a GenEval score of 0.625 at 4 sampling steps without using classifier-free guidance (CFG), outperforming that of the original Show-o with 8 steps and CFG; in image-to-text generation, Show-o Turbo exhibits a 1.5x speedup without significantly sacrificing performance.

Initially, 52 sets of bubbly flow experiments under varying conditions are conducted to collect 140,000 bubbly flow images with physical labels of jg and jf for training data. A multi-scale loss function is then developed, incorporating mismatch loss and pixel loss to enhance the generative performance of BF-GAN further. Regarding evaluative metrics of generative AI, the BF-GAN has surpassed conventional GAN. Physically, key parameters of bubbly flow generated by BF-GAN are extracted and compared with measurement values and empirical correlations, validating BF-GAN's generative performance. The comparative analysis demonstrate that the BF-GAN can generate realistic and high-quality bubbly flow images with any given jg and jf within the research scope. BF-GAN offers a generative AI solution for two-phase flow research, substantially lowering the time and cost required to obtain high-quality data. In addition, it can function as a benchmark dataset generator for bubbly flow detection and segmentation algorithms, enhancing overall productivity in this research domain.

However, recent Consistency Models (CMs), which offer fewer function evaluations, rely on distilling CFG knowledge from pretrained DMs to achieve guidance, making them costly and inflexible. In this work, we propose invertible Guided Consistency Training (iGCT), a novel training framework for guided CMs that is entirely data-driven. iGCT, as a pioneering work, contributes to fast and guided image generation and editing without requiring the training and distillation of DMs, greatly reducing the overall compute requirements. iGCT addresses the saturation artifacts seen in CFG under high guidance scales. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet64 show that iGCT significantly improves FID and precision compared to CFG. At a guidance of 13, iGCT improves precision to 0.8, while DM's drops to 0.47. Our work takes the first step toward enabling guidance and inversion for CMs without relying on DMs.</p></details> |  | None |

QLIP trains a binary-spherical-quantization-based autoencoder with reconstruction and language-image alignment objectives. We are the first to show that the two objectives do not need to be at odds. We balance the two loss terms dynamically during training and show that a two-stage training pipeline effectively mixes the large-batch requirements of image-language pre-training with the memory bottleneck imposed by the reconstruction objective. We validate the effectiveness of QLIP for multimodal understanding and text-conditioned image generation with a single model. Specifically, QLIP serves as a drop-in replacement for the visual encoder for LLaVA and the image tokenizer for LlamaGen with comparable or even better performance. Finally, we demonstrate that QLIP enables a unified mixed-modality auto-regressive model for understanding and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report.

To address this, we introduce Hummingbird, the first diffusion-based image generator which, given a multimodal context, generates highly diverse images w.r.t. the reference image while ensuring high fidelity by accurately preserving scene attributes, such as object interactions and spatial relationships from the text guidance. Hummingbird employs a novel Multimodal Context Evaluator that simultaneously optimizes our formulated Global Semantic and Fine-grained Consistency Rewards to ensure generated images preserve the scene attributes of reference images in relation to the text guidance while maintaining diversity. As the first model to address the task of maintaining both diversity and fidelity given a multimodal context, we introduce a new benchmark formulation incorporating MME Perception and Bongard HOI datasets. Benchmark experiments show Hummingbird outperforms all existing methods by achieving superior fidelity while maintaining diversity, validating Hummingbird's potential as a robust multimodal context-aligned image generator in complex visual tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p></details> |  | None |

Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current approaches face significant challenges when composing these LoRAs for multi-concept image generation, resulting in diminished generated image quality. In this paper, we initially investigate the role of LoRAs in the denoising process through the lens of the Fourier frequency domain. Based on the hypothesis that applying multiple LoRAs could lead to "semantic conflicts", we find that certain LoRAs amplify high-frequency features such as edges and textures, whereas others mainly focus on low-frequency elements, including the overall structure and smooth color gradients. Building on these insights, we devise a frequency domain based sequencing strategy to determine the optimal order in which LoRAs should be integrated during inference. This strategy offers a methodical and generalizable solution compared to the naive integration commonly found in existing LoRA fusion techniques. To fully leverage our proposed LoRA order sequence determination method in multi-LoRA composition tasks, we introduce a novel, training-free framework, Cached Multi-LoRA (CMLoRA), designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while maintaining cohesive image generation. With its flexible backbone for multi-LoRA fusion and a non-uniform caching strategy tailored to individual LoRAs, CMLoRA has the potential to reduce semantic conflicts in LoRA composition and improve computational efficiency. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art training-free LoRA fusion methods by a significant margin -- it achieves an average improvement of $2.19\%$ in CLIPScore, and $11.25\%$ in MLLM win rate compared to LoraHub, LoRA Composite, and LoRA Switch.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs.

To serve as effective training data, generated images must be highly realistic while also sufficiently diverse within the support of the target data distribution. Yet, state-of-the-art conditional image generation models have been primarily optimized for creative applications, prioritizing image realism and prompt adherence over conditional diversity. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the diversity of generated images with the goal of increasing their effectiveness to train downstream image classification models, without fine-tuning the image generation model. We find that conditioning the generation process on an augmented real image and text prompt produces generations that serve as effective synthetic datasets for downstream training. Conditioning on real training images contextualizes the generation process to produce images that are in-domain with the real image distribution, while data augmentations introduce visual diversity that improves the performance of the downstream classifier. We validate augmentation-conditioning on a total of five established long-tail and few-shot image classification benchmarks and show that leveraging augmentations to condition the generation process results in consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on the long-tailed benchmark and remarkable gains in extreme few-shot regimes of the remaining four benchmarks. These results constitute an important step towards effectively leveraging synthetic data for downstream training.</p></details> |  | None |

Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks.

However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model) considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\epsilon, \delta)$-unlearning guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of our approach. To show comparable performance with retrained model, we also show the comparison of a simple AutoEncoder on various baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we comprehensively evaluate a range of text-to-image models on numerical reasoning tasks of varying difficulty, and show that even the most advanced models have only rudimentary numerical skills. Specifically, their ability to correctly generate an exact number of objects in an image is limited to small numbers, it is highly dependent on the context the number term appears in, and it deteriorates quickly with each successive number. We also demonstrate that models have poor understanding of linguistic quantifiers (such as "a few" or "as many as"), the concept of zero, and struggle with more advanced concepts such as partial quantities and fractional representations. We bundle prompts, generated images and human annotations into GeckoNum, a novel benchmark for evaluation of numerical reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

These models exhibit a remarkable ability to generate highly artistic and intricately detailed images based on textual prompts. However, obtaining desired generation outcomes often necessitates repetitive trials of manipulating text prompts just like casting spells on a magic mirror, and the reason behind that is the limited capability of semantic understanding inherent in current image generation models. Specifically, existing diffusion models encode the text prompt input with a pre-trained encoder structure, which is usually trained on a limited number of image-caption pairs. The state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) based on the decoder-only structure have shown a powerful semantic understanding capability as their architectures are more suitable for training on very large-scale unlabeled data. In this work, we propose to enhance text-to-image diffusion models by borrowing the strength of semantic understanding from large language models, and devise a simple yet effective adapter to allow the diffusion models to be compatible with the decoder-only structure. Meanwhile, we also provide a supporting theoretical analysis with various architectures (e.g., encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only), and conduct extensive empirical evaluations to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the enhanced models with our adapter module are superior to the stat-of-the-art models in terms of text-to-image generation quality and reliability.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite these technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these models' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal biases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is included in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes in the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel framework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social biases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an LLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in generated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module that fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate identified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and datasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining high-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and quantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space, building upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our results show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the diversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate, using the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are challenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond occupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.</p></details> |  | None |

The pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) models are helpful for image deblurring by providing clear image priors. However, directly using a blurry image or pre-deblurred one as a conditional control for SD will either hinder accurate structure extraction or make the results overly dependent on the deblurring network. In this work, we propose a Latent Kernel Prediction Network (LKPN) to achieve robust real-world image deblurring. Specifically, we co-train the LKPN in latent space with conditional diffusion. The LKPN learns a spatially variant kernel to guide the restoration of sharp images in the latent space. By applying element-wise adaptive convolution (EAC), the learned kernel is utilized to adaptively process the input feature, effectively preserving the structural information of the input. This process thereby more effectively guides the generative process of Stable Diffusion (SD), enhancing both the deblurring efficacy and the quality of detail reconstruction. Moreover, the results at each diffusion step are utilized to iteratively estimate the kernels in LKPN to better restore the sharp latent by EAC. This iterative refinement enhances the accuracy and robustness of the deblurring process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on both benchmark and real-world images.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

To address this, various safety mechanisms and red teaming attack methods are proposed to enhance or expose the T2I model's capability to generate unsuitable content. However, many red teaming attack methods assume knowledge of the text encoders, limiting their practical usage. In this work, we rethink the case of \textit{purely black-box} attacks without prior knowledge of the T2l model. To overcome the unavailability of gradients and the inability to optimize attacks within a discrete prompt space, we propose DiffZOO which applies Zeroth Order Optimization to procure gradient approximations and harnesses both C-PRV and D-PRV to enhance attack prompts within the discrete prompt domain. We evaluated our method across multiple safety mechanisms of the T2I diffusion model and online servers. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art safety mechanisms show that DiffZOO attains an 8.5% higher average attack success rate than previous works, hence its promise as a practical red teaming tool for T2l models.</p></details> |  | None |

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a popular and effective technique for improving text-image alignment in the generative process. However, using CFG introduces significant computational overhead and deviates from the established theoretical foundations of diffusion models. In this paper, we present DIstilling CFG by enhancing text Embeddings (DICE), a novel approach that removes the reliance on CFG in the generative process while maintaining the benefits it provides. DICE distills a CFG-based text-to-image diffusion model into a CFG-free version by refining text embeddings to replicate CFG-based directions. In this way, we avoid the computational and theoretical drawbacks of CFG, enabling high-quality, well-aligned image generation at a fast sampling speed. Extensive experiments on multiple Stable Diffusion v1.5 variants, SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, DICE supports negative prompts for image editing to improve image quality further. Code will be available soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Fair and Robust Face Parsing for Generative AI: A Multi-Objective Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04391v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face parsing is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling applications such as identity verification, facial editing, and controllable image synthesis. However, existing face parsing models often lack fairness and robustness, leading to biased segmentation across demographic groups and errors under occlusions, noise, and domain shifts. These limitations affect downstream face synthesis, where segmentation biases can degrade generative model outputs. We propose a multi-objective learning framework that optimizes accuracy, fairness, and robustness in face parsing. Our approach introduces a homotopy-based loss function that dynamically adjusts the importance of these objectives during training. To evaluate its impact, we compare multi-objective and single-objective U-Net models in a GAN-based face synthesis pipeline (Pix2PixHD). Our results show that fairness-aware and robust segmentation improves photorealism and consistency in face generation. Additionally, we conduct preliminary experiments using ControlNet, a structured conditioning model for diffusion-based synthesis, to explore how segmentation quality influences guided image generation. Our findings demonstrate that multi-objective face parsing improves demographic consistency and robustness, leading to higher-quality GAN-based synthesis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Conditional Diffusion Models are Medical Image Classifiers that Provide Explainability and Uncertainty for Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03687v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

| **[On Fairness of Unified Multimodal Large Language Model for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03429v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal large language models (U-MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in visual understanding and generation in an end-to-end pipeline. Compared with generation-only models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), U-MLLMs may raise new questions about bias in their outputs, which can be affected by their unified capabilities. This gap is particularly concerning given the under-explored risk of propagating harmful stereotypes. In this paper, we benchmark the latest U-MLLMs and find that most exhibit significant demographic biases, such as gender and race bias. To better understand and mitigate this issue, we propose a locate-then-fix strategy, where we audit and show how the individual model component is affected by bias. Our analysis shows that bias originates primarily from the language model. More interestingly, we observe a "partial alignment" phenomenon in U-MLLMs, where understanding bias appears minimal, but generation bias remains substantial. Thus, we propose a novel balanced preference model to balance the demographic distribution with synthetic data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces demographic bias while preserving semantic fidelity. We hope our findings underscore the need for more holistic interpretation and debiasing strategies of U-MLLMs in the future.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TruePose: Human-Parsing-guided Attention Diffusion for Full-ID Preserving Pose Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03426v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates images that maintain a subject's identity from a source image while adopting a specified target pose (e.g., skeleton). While diffusion-based PGPIS methods effectively preserve facial features during pose transformation, they often struggle to accurately maintain clothing details from the source image throughout the diffusion process. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when there is a substantial difference between the source and target poses, significantly impacting PGPIS applications in the fashion industry where clothing style preservation is crucial for copyright protection. Our analysis reveals that this limitation primarily stems from the conditional diffusion model's attention modules failing to adequately capture and preserve clothing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose human-parsing-guided attention diffusion, a novel approach that effectively preserves both facial and clothing appearance while generating high-quality results. We propose a human-parsing-aware Siamese network that consists of three key components: dual identical UNets (TargetNet for diffusion denoising and SourceNet for source image embedding extraction), a human-parsing-guided fusion attention (HPFA), and a CLIP-guided attention alignment (CAA). The HPFA and CAA modules can embed the face and clothes patterns into the target image generation adaptively and effectively. Extensive experiments on both the in-shop clothes retrieval benchmark and the latest in-the-wild human editing dataset demonstrate our method's significant advantages over 13 baseline approaches for preserving both facial and clothes appearance in the source image.</p></details> |  | None |

A Comparative Study on Synthetic Portrait Generation and Age Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03420v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable progress in producing diverse and photorealistic outputs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness in creating synthetic portraits that accurately represent various demographic attributes, with a special focus on age, nationality, and gender. Our evaluation employs prompts specifying detailed profiles (e.g., Photorealistic selfie photo of a 32-year-old Canadian male), covering a broad spectrum of 212 nationalities, 30 distinct ages from 10 to 78, and balanced gender representation. We compare the generated images against ground truth age estimates from two established age estimation models to assess how faithfully age is depicted. Our findings reveal that although text-to-image models can consistently generate faces reflecting different identities, the accuracy with which they capture specific ages and do so across diverse demographic backgrounds remains highly variable. These results suggest that current synthetic data may be insufficiently reliable for high-stakes age-related tasks requiring robust precision, unless practitioners are prepared to invest in significant filtering and curation. Nevertheless, they may still be useful in less sensitive or exploratory applications, where absolute age precision is not critical.</p></details> |  | None |

Generative approaches are particularly effective in modeling the statistical properties of segmentation masks that are closely related to the respective structures. In this work we introduce FlowSDF, an image-guided conditional flow matching framework, designed to represent the signed distance function (SDF), and, in turn, to represent an implicit distribution of segmentation masks. The advantage of leveraging the SDF is a more natural distortion when compared to that of binary masks. Through the learning of a vector field associated with the probability path of conditional SDF distributions, our framework enables accurate sampling of segmentation masks and the computation of relevant statistical measures. This probabilistic approach also facilitates the generation of uncertainty maps represented by the variance, thereby supporting enhanced robustness in prediction and further analysis. We qualitatively and quantitatively illustrate competitive performance of the proposed method on a public nuclei and gland segmentation data set, highlighting its utility in medical image segmentation applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[PSC: Posterior Sampling-Based Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09896v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have transformed the landscape of image generation and now show remarkable potential for image compression. Most of the recent diffusion-based compression methods require training and are tailored for a specific bit-rate. In this work, we propose Posterior Sampling-based Compression (PSC) - a zero-shot compression method that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model as its sole neural network component, thus enabling the use of diverse, publicly available models without additional training. Our approach is inspired by transform coding methods, which encode the image in some pre-chosen transform domain. However, PSC constructs a transform that is adaptive to the image. This is done by employing a zero-shot diffusion-based posterior sampler so as to progressively construct the rows of the transform matrix. Each new chunk of rows is chosen to reduce the uncertainty about the image given the quantized measurements collected thus far. Importantly, the same adaptive scheme can be replicated at the decoder, thus avoiding the need to encode the transform itself. We demonstrate that even with basic quantization and entropy coding, PSC's performance is comparable to established training-based methods in terms of rate, distortion, and perceptual quality. This is while providing greater flexibility, allowing to choose at inference time any desired rate or distortion.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods typically exhibit distinct strengths for compositional generation, with some excelling in handling attribute binding and others in spatial relationships. This disparity highlights the need for an approach that can leverage the complementary strengths of various models to comprehensively improve the composition capability. To this end, we introduce IterComp, a novel framework that aggregates composition-aware model preferences from multiple models and employs an iterative feedback learning approach to enhance compositional generation. Specifically, we curate a gallery of six powerful open-source diffusion models and evaluate their three key compositional metrics: attribute binding, spatial relationships, and non-spatial relationships. Based on these metrics, we develop a composition-aware model preference dataset comprising numerous image-rank pairs to train composition-aware reward models. Then, we propose an iterative feedback learning method to enhance compositionality in a closed-loop manner, enabling the progressive self-refinement of both the base diffusion model and reward models over multiple iterations. Theoretical proof demonstrates the effectiveness and extensive experiments show our significant superiority over previous SOTA methods (e.g., Omost and FLUX), particularly in multi-category object composition and complex semantic alignment. IterComp opens new research avenues in reward feedback learning for diffusion models and compositional generation.

However, customizing these models with new classes often leads to unintended consequences that compromise their reliability. We introduce the concept of open-world forgetting to characterize the vast scope of these unintended alterations. Our work presents the first systematic investigation into open-world forgetting in diffusion models, focusing on semantic and appearance drift of representations. Using zero-shot classification, we demonstrate that even minor model adaptations can lead to significant semantic drift affecting areas far beyond newly introduced concepts, with accuracy drops of up to 60% on previously learned concepts. Our analysis of appearance drift reveals substantial changes in texture and color distributions of generated content. To address these issues, we propose a functional regularization strategy that effectively preserves original capabilities while accommodating new concepts. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both semantic and appearance drift. Our study highlights the importance of considering open-world forgetting in future research on model customization and finetuning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update: Added feedback; Project page: https://hecoding.github.io/open-world-forgetting/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://hecoding.github.io/open-world-forgetting) |

However, they struggle to support the consistent generation of identity-preserving requirements for storytelling. Existing approaches to this problem typically require extensive training in large datasets or additional modifications to the original model architectures. This limits their applicability across different domains and diverse diffusion model configurations. In this paper, we first observe the inherent capability of language models, coined context consistency, to comprehend identity through context with a single prompt. Drawing inspiration from the inherent context consistency, we propose a novel training-free method for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation, termed "One-Prompt-One-Story" (1Prompt1Story). Our approach 1Prompt1Story concatenates all prompts into a single input for T2I diffusion models, initially preserving character identities. We then refine the generation process using two novel techniques: Singular-Value Reweighting and Identity-Preserving Cross-Attention, ensuring better alignment with the input description for each frame. In our experiments, we compare our method against various existing consistent T2I generation approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.

Most existing methods generate background for products primarily focus on the aesthetic quality, which may fail to achieve satisfactory online performance. To address this limitation, we explore the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for generating advertising images by optimizing for Click-Through Rate (CTR) as the primary objective. Firstly, we build targeted pre-training tasks, and leverage a large-scale e-commerce multimodal dataset to equip MLLMs with initial capabilities for advertising image generation tasks. To further improve the CTR of generated images, we propose a novel reward model to fine-tune pre-trained MLLMs through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which can jointly utilize multimodal features and accurately reflect user click preferences. Meanwhile, a product-centric preference optimization strategy is developed to ensure that the generated background content aligns with the product characteristics after fine-tuning, enhancing the overall relevance and effectiveness of the advertising images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both online and offline metrics.

Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.72 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.80 through inference scaling, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible.</p></details> |  | None |

Generating procedural tutorials with AI is a longstanding but challenging goal, facing three key obstacles: (1) scarcity of multi-task procedural datasets, (2) maintaining logical continuity and visual consistency between steps, and (3) generalizing across multiple domains. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-domain dataset covering 21 tasks with over 24,000 procedural sequences. Building upon this foundation, we introduce MakeAnything, a framework based on the diffusion transformer (DIT), which leverages fine-tuning to activate the in-context capabilities of DIT for generating consistent procedural sequences. We introduce asymmetric low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for image generation, which balances generalization capabilities and task-specific performance by freezing encoder parameters while adaptively tuning decoder layers. Additionally, our ReCraft model enables image-to-process generation through spatiotemporal consistency constraints, allowing static images to be decomposed into plausible creation sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MakeAnything surpasses existing methods, setting new performance benchmarks for procedural generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite advances in CD methods, their practical application in real-world contexts remains limited due to the diverse input data and the applicational context. For example, the collected RSIs can be time-series observations, and more informative results are required to indicate the time of change or the specific change category. Moreover, training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) requires a massive amount of training samples, whereas in many cases these samples are difficult to collect. To address these challenges, various specific CD methods have been developed considering different application scenarios and training resources. Additionally, recent advancements in image generation, self-supervision, and visual foundation models (VFMs) have opened up new approaches to address the 'data-hungry' issue of DL-based CD. The development of these methods in broader application scenarios requires further investigation and discussion. Therefore, this article summarizes the literature methods for different CD tasks and the available strategies and techniques to train and deploy DL-based CD methods in sample-limited scenarios. We expect that this survey can provide new insights and inspiration for researchers in this field to develop more effective CD methods that can be applied in a wider range of contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE GRSM</p></details> | None |

LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Name ...</summary><p>Name change: LlamaFusion to LMFusion</p></details> | None |

A Study with Sparse-view CT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02771v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on image generation, and are gaining traction for sparse medical image reconstruction tasks. However, compared to classical reconstruction algorithms relying on simple analytical priors, diffusion models have the dangerous property of producing realistic looking results \emph{even when incorrect}, particularly with few observations. We investigate the utility of diffusion models as priors for image reconstruction by varying the number of observations and comparing their performance to classical priors (sparse and Tikhonov regularization) using pixel-based, structural, and downstream metrics. We make comparisons on low-dose chest wall computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification. First, we find that classical priors are superior to diffusion priors when the number of projections is ``sufficient''. Second, we find that diffusion priors can capture a large amount of detail with very few observations, significantly outperforming classical priors. However, they fall short of capturing all details, even with many observations. Finally, we find that the performance of diffusion priors plateau after extremely few ($\approx$10-15) projections. Ultimately, our work highlights potential issues with diffusion-based sparse reconstruction and underscores the importance of further investigation, particularly in high-stakes clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ISBI 2025, 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

Specifically, Lavender aligns the text-vision attention in the VLM transformer with the equivalent used by Stable Diffusion during SFT, instead of adapting separate encoders. This alignment enriches the model's visual understanding and significantly boosts performance across in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Lavender requires just 0.13 million training examples, 2.5% of typical large-scale SFT datasets, and fine-tunes on standard hardware (8 GPUs) in a single day. It consistently improves state-of-the-art open-source multimodal LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2-11B, MiniCPM-Llama3-v2.5), achieving up to 30% gains and a 68% boost on challenging out-of-distribution medical QA tasks.

When such base models are deprecated and replaced, all associated LoRA modules must be retrained, requiring access to either the original training data or a substantial amount of synthetic data that mirrors the original distribution. However, the original data is often inaccessible due to privacy or licensing issues, and generating synthetic data may be impractical and insufficiently representative. These factors complicate the fine-tuning process considerably. To address this challenge, we introduce a new adapter, Cross-Model Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-X), which enables the training-free transfer of LoRA parameters across source and target models, eliminating the need for original or synthetic training data. Our approach imposes the adapter to operate within the subspace of the source base model. This constraint is necessary because our prior knowledge of the target model is limited to its weights, and the criteria for ensuring the adapter's transferability are restricted to the target base model's weights and subspace. To facilitate the transfer of LoRA parameters of the source model to a target model, we employ the adapter only in the layers of the target model that exhibit an acceptable level of subspace similarity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-X for text-to-image generation, including Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |

We first speculate multiple images of a video are differentiable with respect to time in some latent space. Based on this conjecture, we introduce the HiPPO framework to approximate the optimal projection for polynomials to generate the probability path. Our approach gains the theoretical benefits of the bounded universal approximation error and timescale robustness. Moreover, VLFM processes the interpolation and extrapolation abilities for video generation with arbitrary frame rates. We conduct experiments on several text-to-video datasets to showcase the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 39 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[On the Guidance of Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02150v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has shown state-of-the-art performance in various generative tasks, ranging from image generation to decision-making, where guided generation is pivotal. However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/flow_guidance.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/flow_guidance) |

To obtain this schedule, we measure the probability-distributional change of diffused data by simulating the forward process and use it to determine the noise schedule before training diffusion models. The functional form of the noise schedule is automatically determined and tailored to each dataset and type of diffusion model, such as pixel space or latent space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our noise schedule on unconditional and class-conditional image generation tasks using the LSUN (Bedroom, Church, Cat, Horse), ImageNet, and FFHQ datasets. Through extensive experiments, we confirmed that our noise schedule broadly improves the performance of the pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models regardless of the dataset, sampler, and number of function evaluations.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |

Conversely, diffusion models have demonstrated significant efficacy in modeling arbitrary probability distributions. In this paper, we introduce Denoising with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (D-JEPA), pioneering the integration of JEPA within generative modeling. By recognizing JEPA as a form of masked image modeling, we reinterpret it as a generalized next-token prediction strategy, facilitating data generation in an auto-regressive manner. Furthermore, we incorporate diffusion loss to model the per-token probability distribution, enabling data generation in a continuous space. We also adapt flow matching loss as an alternative to diffusion loss, thereby enhancing the flexibility of D-JEPA. Empirically, with increased GFLOPs, D-JEPA consistently achieves lower FID scores with fewer training epochs, indicating its good scalability. Our base, large, and huge models outperform all previous generative models across all scales on ImageNet conditional generation benchmarks. Beyond image generation, D-JEPA is well-suited for other continuous data modeling, including video and audio.</p></details> | 38 pages | None |

Unlike multi-image finetuning approaches such as DreamBooth, these zero-shot methods leverage powerful facial encoders to extract identity information from a single portrait photo, enabling efficient identity-preserving generation through a single inference pass. However, this convenience introduces new threats to the facial identity protection. This paper aims to safeguard portrait photos from unauthorized encoder-based customization. We introduce IDProtector, an adversarial noise encoder that applies imperceptible adversarial noise to portrait photos in a single forward pass. Our approach offers universal protection for portraits against multiple state-of-the-art encoder-based methods, including InstantID, IP-Adapter, and PhotoMaker, while ensuring robustness to common image transformations such as JPEG compression, resizing, and affine transformations. Experiments across diverse portrait datasets and generative models reveal that IDProtector generalizes effectively to unseen data and even closed-source proprietary models.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite research efforts to decrease the acquisition time, and designing efficient acquisition sequences, motion artifacts are still a persistent problem, pushing toward the need for the development of automatic motion artifact correction techniques. Recently, diffusion models have been proposed as a solution for the task at hand. While diffusion models can produce high-quality reconstructions, they are also susceptible to hallucination, which poses risks in diagnostic applications. In this study, we critically evaluate the use of diffusion models for correcting motion artifacts in 2D brain MRI scans. Using a popular benchmark dataset, we compare a diffusion model-based approach with state-of-the-art methods consisting of Unets trained in a supervised fashion on motion-affected images to reconstruct ground truth motion-free images. Our findings reveal mixed results: diffusion models can produce accurate predictions or generate harmful hallucinations in this context, depending on data heterogeneity and the acquisition planes considered as input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Symposium for Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2025</p></details> | None |

Suppose that $n$ represents the height and width of the last VQ code map generated by $\mathsf{VAR}$ models, the state-of-the-art algorithm in [Tian, Jiang, Yuan, Peng and Wang, NeurIPS 2024] takes $O(n^{4+o(1)})$ time, which is computationally inefficient. In this work, we analyze the computational limits and efficiency criteria of $\mathsf{VAR}$ Models through a fine-grained complexity lens. Our key contribution is identifying the conditions under which $\mathsf{VAR}$ computations can achieve sub-quadratic time complexity. We have proved that assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$) from fine-grained complexity theory, a sub-quartic time algorithm for $\mathsf{VAR}$ models is impossible. To substantiate our theoretical findings, we present efficient constructions leveraging low-rank approximations that align with the derived criteria. This work initiates the study of the computational efficiency of the $\mathsf{VAR}$ model from a theoretical perspective. Our technique will shed light on advancing scalable and efficient image generation in $\mathsf{VAR}$ frameworks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RealRAG: Retrieval-augmented Realistic Image Generation via Self-reflective Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00848v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion V3 and Flux, have achieved notable progress. However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach introduces a new dynamic KL-weighting strategy to optimize the diffusion process, along with incorporating semantic understanding from pre-trained LLMs to guide the generation process. The proposed method significantly improves both the visual quality and alignment of generated images with text descriptions, addressing challenges such as computational inefficiency, instability in training, and robustness to textual variability. We evaluate our method on the COCO dataset and demonstrate its superior performance over traditional GAN-based models, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and human evaluations, confirm that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of image realism, relevance to the input text, and overall aesthetic quality. Our approach also shows promise in scalability to other multimodal tasks, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of generative applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Your Image is Secretly the Last Frame of a Pseudo Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20158v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, which can be viewed as a special case of hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), have shown profound success in generating photo-realistic images. In contrast, standard HVAEs often produce images of inferior quality compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the success of diffusion models can be partly attributed to the additional self-supervision information for their intermediate latent states provided by corrupted images, which along with the original image form a pseudo video. Based on this hypothesis, we explore the possibility of improving other types of generative models with such pseudo videos. Specifically, we first extend a given image generative model to their video generative model counterpart, and then train the video generative model on pseudo videos constructed by applying data augmentation to the original images. Furthermore, we analyze the potential issues of first-order Markov data augmentation methods, which are typically used in diffusion models, and propose to use more expressive data augmentation to construct more useful information in pseudo videos. Our empirical results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets demonstrate that improved image generation quality can be achieved with additional self-supervised information from pseudo videos.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, AI-generated Images (AIGIs) may not satisfy human preferences due to their unique distortions, which highlights the necessity to understand and evaluate human preferences for AIGIs. To this end, in this paper, we first establish a novel Image Quality Assessment (IQA) database for AIGIs, termed AIGCIQA2023+, which provides human visual preference scores and detailed preference explanations from three perspectives including quality, authenticity, and correspondence. Then, based on the constructed AIGCIQA2023+ database, this paper presents a MINT-IQA model to evaluate and explain human preferences for AIGIs from Multi-perspectives with INstruction Tuning. Specifically, the MINT-IQA model first learn and evaluate human preferences for AI-generated Images from multi-perspectives, then via the vision-language instruction tuning strategy, MINT-IQA attains powerful understanding and explanation ability for human visual preference on AIGIs, which can be used for feedback to further improve the assessment capabilities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MINT-IQA model achieves state-of-the-art performance in understanding and evaluating human visual preferences for AIGIs, and the proposed model also achieves competing results on traditional IQA tasks compared with state-of-the-art IQA models.

However, these systems merely filter existing content and are constrained by its limited diversity, making it difficult to meet users' varied content needs. To address this limitation, personalized content generation has emerged as a promising direction with broad applications. Nevertheless, most existing research focuses on personalized text generation, with relatively little attention given to personalized image generation. The limited work in personalized image generation faces challenges in accurately capturing users' visual preferences and needs from noisy user-interacted images and complex multimodal instructions. Worse still, there is a lack of supervised data for training personalized image generation models. To overcome the challenges, we propose a Personalized Image Generation Framework named Pigeon, which adopts exceptional large multimodal models with three dedicated modules to capture users' visual preferences and needs from noisy user history and multimodal instructions. To alleviate the data scarcity, we introduce a two-stage preference alignment scheme, comprising masked preference reconstruction and pairwise preference alignment, to align Pigeon with the personalized image generation task. We apply Pigeon to personalized sticker and movie poster generation, where extensive quantitative results and human evaluation highlight its superiority over various generative baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in WWW'25</p></details> | None |
| **[Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653v3)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques. In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, using masked images diversifies perceptual inputs, potentially offering significant advantages in concept learning with large-scale Transformer models. To this end, we propose Multi-layer Concept Map (MCM), the first work to devise an efficient concept learning method based on masked images. In particular, we introduce an asymmetric concept learning architecture by establishing correlations between different encoder and decoder layers, updating concept tokens using backward gradients from reconstruction tasks. The learned concept tokens at various levels of granularity help either reconstruct the masked image patches by filling in gaps or guide the reconstruction results in a direction that reflects specific concepts. Moreover, we present both quantitative and qualitative results across a wide range of metrics, demonstrating that MCM significantly reduces computational costs by training on fewer than 75% of the total image patches while enhancing concept prediction performance. Additionally, editing specific concept tokens in the latent space enables targeted image generation from masked images, aligning both the visible contextual patches and the provided concepts. By further adjusting the testing time mask ratio, we could produce a range of reconstructions that blend the visible patches with the provided concepts, proportional to the chosen ratios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $\tau$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $\tau$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $\theta$-trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GPT-2 level text and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints.</p></details> | 38 pages, 7 figures | None |

To address the challenge, we leverage the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to develop a novel data-driven algorithm, called batch ADMM (BADM). The fundamental idea of the proposed algorithm is to split the training data into batches, which is further divided into sub-batches where primal and dual variables are updated to generate global parameters through aggregation. We evaluate the performance of BADM across various deep learning tasks, including graph modelling, computer vision, image generation, and natural language processing. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that BADM achieves faster convergence and superior testing accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art optimizers.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RealCraft: Attention Control as A Tool for Zero-Shot Consistent Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12635v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even though large-scale text-to-image generative models show promising performance in synthesizing high-quality images, applying these models directly to image editing remains a significant challenge. This challenge is further amplified in video editing due to the additional dimension of time. This is especially the case for editing real-world videos as it necessitates maintaining a stable structural layout across frames while executing localized edits without disrupting the existing content. In this paper, we propose RealCraft, an attention-control-based method for zero-shot real-world video editing. By swapping cross-attention for new feature injection and relaxing spatial-temporal attention of the editing object, we achieve localized shape-wise edit along with enhanced temporal consistency. Our model directly uses Stable Diffusion and operates without the need for additional information. We showcase the proposed zero-shot attention-control-based method across a range of videos, demonstrating shape-wise, time-consistent and parameter-free editing in videos of up to 64 frames.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LANTERN: Accelerating Visual Autoregressive Models with Relaxed Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03355v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-Regressive (AR) models have recently gained prominence in image generation, often matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion models. However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature, which processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to models like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently. While speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by generating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in this setting, which we term \textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual AR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering the performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose a relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the interchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the effectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more flexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected. Furthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that these speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality or semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding. In specific, compared to a na\"ive application of the state-of-the-art speculative decoding, LANTERN increases speed-ups by $\mathbf{1.75}\times$ and $\mathbf{1.82}\times$, as compared to greedy decoding and random sampling, respectively, when applied to LlamaGen, a contemporary visual AR model.</p></details> | 30 pages, 13 figures | None |

Stochastic object models (SOMs) that can randomly draw samples from the object distribution can be employed to characterize object variability. To establish realistic SOMs for task-based IQ analysis, it is desirable to employ experimental image data. However, experimental image data acquired from medical imaging systems are subject to measurement noise. Previous work investigated the ability of deep generative models (DGMs) that employ an augmented generative adversarial network (GAN), AmbientGAN, for establishing SOMs from noisy measured image data. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a leading DGM for image synthesis and can produce superior image quality than GANs. However, original DDMs possess a slow image-generation process because of the Gaussian assumption in the denoising steps. More recently, denoising diffusion GAN (DDGAN) was proposed to permit fast image generation while maintain high generated image quality that is comparable to the original DDMs. In this work, we propose an augmented DDGAN architecture, Ambient DDGAN (ADDGAN), for learning SOMs from noisy image data. Numerical studies that consider clinical computed tomography (CT) images and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images are conducted. The ability of the proposed ADDGAN to learn realistic SOMs from noisy image data is demonstrated. It has been shown that the ADDGAN significantly outperforms the advanced AmbientGAN models for synthesizing high resolution medical images with complex textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE ...</summary><p>SPIE Medical Imaging 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lack scalability, and/or compromise generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than current state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures | None |

Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 2.9x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.92% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches, such as prompt filtering or concept unlearning, fail to defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining benign image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Distorting Embedding Space (DES), a text encoder-based defense mechanism that effectively tackles these issues through innovative embedding space control. DES transforms unsafe embeddings, extracted from a text encoder using unsafe prompts, toward carefully calculated safe embedding regions to prevent unsafe contents generation, while reproducing the original safe embeddings. DES also neutralizes the nudity embedding, extracted using prompt ``nudity", by aligning it with neutral embedding to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. These methods ensure both robust defense and high-quality image generation. Additionally, DES can be adopted in a plug-and-play manner and requires zero inference overhead, facilitating its deployment. Extensive experiments on diverse attack types, including black-box and white-box scenarios, demonstrate DES's state-of-the-art performance in both defense capability and benign image generation quality.

Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures | None |

We present a simple diffusion tokenizer (DiTo) that learns compact visual representations for image generation models. Our key insight is that a single learning objective, diffusion L2 loss, can be used for training scalable image tokenizers. Since diffusion is already widely used for image generation, our insight greatly simplifies training such tokenizers. In contrast, current state-of-the-art tokenizers rely on an empirically found combination of heuristics and losses, thus requiring a complex training recipe that relies on non-trivially balancing different losses and pretrained supervised models. We show design decisions, along with theoretical grounding, that enable us to scale DiTo for learning competitive image representations. Our results show that DiTo is a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to the current state-of-the-art image tokenizer which is supervised. DiTo achieves competitive or better quality than state-of-the-art in image reconstruction and downstream image generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yinboc.github.io/dito/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yinboc.github.io/dito) |
| **[More Expressive Attention with Negative Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07176v3)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel attention mechanism, named Cog Attention, that enables attention weights to be negative for enhanced expressiveness, which stems from two key factors: (1) Cog Attention enhances parameter flexibility. For example, unlike traditional softmax attention heads that use a static output-value (OV) matrix to delete or copy inputs that the heads attend to, Cog Attention naturally learns to use the sign of dynamic query-key (QK) inner products to represent these operations. This enables Cog Attention to perform multiple operations simultaneously within a single head. Meanwhile, Cog Attention's OV matrix can focus more on refinement or modification. (2) Cog Attention enhances the model's robustness against representational collapse by preventing the ``over-squashing'' of earlier tokens into later positions. We develop Transformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including decoder-only models at various scales for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion models for image generation. Experiments show that models using Cog Attention exhibit superior performance compared to those employing traditional softmax attention modules. Our approach suggests a promising research direction for rethinking and breaking the entrenched constraints of traditional softmax attention, such as the requirement for non-negative weights.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[High-Accuracy ECG Image Interpretation using Parameter-Efficient LoRA Fine-Tuning with Multimodal LLaMA 3.2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18670v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is a cornerstone of cardiac diagnostics. This paper explores a practical approach to enhance ECG image interpretation using the multimodal LLaMA 3.2 model. We used a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), specifically designed to boost the model's ability to understand ECG images and achieve better outcomes across a wide range of cardiac conditions. Our method is tailored for ECG analysis and leverages ECGInstruct, a large-scale instruction dataset with 1 Million samples. This dataset is a rich collection of synthesized ECG images, generated from raw ECG data from trusted open-source repositories like MIMIC-IV ECG and PTB-XL. Each ECG image in ECGInstruct comes with expert-written questions and detailed answers, covering diverse ECG interpretation scenarios, including complex cardiac conditions like Myocardial Infarction and Conduction Disturbances. Our fine-tuning approach efficiently adapts the LLaMA 3.2 model (built upon LLaMA 3) by integrating low-rank adaptation techniques, focusing on efficiency by updating only a small set of parameters, specifically ignoring the `lm_head` and `embed_tokens` layers. This paper details the model setup, our efficient fine-tuning method, and implementation specifics. We provide a thorough evaluation through extensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method across various ECG interpretation tasks. The results convincingly show that our parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning achieves excellent performance in ECG image interpretation, significantly outperforming baseline models and reaching accuracy comparable to or exceeding traditional CNN-based methods in identifying a wide range of cardiac abnormalities, including over 70 conditions from the PTB-XL dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DreamArtist++: Controllable One-Shot Text-to-Image Generation via Positive-Negative Adapter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11337v4)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-arts text-to-image generation models such as Imagen and Stable Diffusion Model have succeed remarkable progresses in synthesizing high-quality, feature-rich images with high resolution guided by human text prompts. Since certain characteristics of image content \emph{e.g.}, very specific object entities or styles, are very hard to be accurately described by text, some example-based image generation approaches have been proposed, \emph{i.e.} generating new concepts based on absorbing the salient features of a few input references. Despite of acknowledged successes, these methods have struggled on accurately capturing the reference examples' characteristics while keeping diverse and high-quality image generation, particularly in the one-shot scenario (\emph{i.e.} given only one reference). To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet effective framework, namely DreamArtist, which adopts a novel positive-negative prompt-tuning learning strategy on the pre-trained diffusion model, and it has shown to well handle the trade-off between the accurate controllability and fidelity of image generation with only one reference example. Specifically, our proposed framework incorporates both positive and negative embeddings or adapters and optimizes them in a joint manner. The positive part aggressively captures the salient characteristics of the reference image to drive diversified generation and the negative part rectifies inadequacies from the positive part. We have conducted extensive experiments and evaluated the proposed method from image similarity (fidelity) and diversity, generation controllability, and style cloning. And our DreamArtist has achieved a superior generation performance over existing methods. Besides, our additional evaluation on extended tasks, including concept compositions and prompt-guided image editing, demonstrates its effectiveness for more applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[©Plug-in Authorization for Human Content Copyright Protection in Text-to-Image Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11962v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the contentious issue of copyright infringement in images generated by text-to-image models, sparking debates among AI developers, content creators, and legal entities. State-of-the-art models create high-quality content without crediting original creators, causing concern in the artistic community. To mitigate this, we propose the \copyright Plug-in Authorization framework, introducing three operations: addition, extraction, and combination. Addition involves training a \copyright plug-in for specific copyright, facilitating proper credit attribution. Extraction allows creators to reclaim copyright from infringing models, and combination enables users to merge different \copyright plug-ins. These operations act as permits, incentivizing fair use and providing flexibility in authorization. We present innovative approaches,"Reverse LoRA" for extraction and "EasyMerge" for seamless combination. Experiments in artist-style replication and cartoon IP recreation demonstrate \copyright plug-ins' effectiveness, offering a valuable solution for human copyright protection in the age of generative AIs. The code is available at https://github.com/zc1023/-Plug-in-Authorization.git.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/zc1023/-Plug-in-Authorization.git) |
| **[Simulation of microstructures and machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18313v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning offers attractive solutions to challenging image processing tasks. Tedious development and parametrization of algorithmic solutions can be replaced by training a convolutional neural network or a random forest with a high potential to generalize. However, machine learning methods rely on huge amounts of representative image data along with a ground truth, usually obtained by manual annotation. Thus, limited availability of training data is a critical bottleneck. We discuss two use cases: optical quality control in industrial production and segmenting crack structures in 3D images of concrete. For optical quality control, all defect types have to be trained but are typically not evenly represented in the training data. Additionally, manual annotation is costly and often inconsistent. It is nearly impossible in the second case: segmentation of crack systems in 3D images of concrete. Synthetic images, generated based on realizations of stochastic geometry models, offer an elegant way out. A wide variety of structure types can be generated. The within structure variation is naturally captured by the stochastic nature of the models and the ground truth is for free. Many new questions arise. In particular, which characteristics of the real image data have to be met to which degree of fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of: K. Schladitz, C.

| **[EliGen: Entity-Level Controlled Image Generation with Regional Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01097v3)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation, yet global text prompts alone remain insufficient for achieving fine-grained control over individual entities within an image. To address this limitation, we present EliGen, a novel framework for Entity-level controlled image Generation. Firstly, we put forward regional attention, a mechanism for diffusion transformers that requires no additional parameters, seamlessly integrating entity prompts and arbitrary-shaped spatial masks. By contributing a high-quality dataset with fine-grained spatial and semantic entity-level annotations, we train EliGen to achieve robust and accurate entity-level manipulation, surpassing existing methods in both spatial precision and image quality. Additionally, we propose an inpainting fusion pipeline, extending its capabilities to multi-entity image inpainting tasks. We further demonstrate its flexibility by integrating it with other open-source models such as IP-Adapter, In-Context LoRA and MLLM, unlocking new creative possibilities. The source code, model, and dataset are published at https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio.git.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio.git) |

Leveraging their innate ability to perform multi-step reasoning, MILS prompts the LLM to generate candidate outputs, each of which are scored and fed back iteratively, eventually generating a solution to the task. This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer! Finally, being a gradient-free optimization approach, MILS can invert multimodal embeddings into text, enabling applications like cross-modal arithmetic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/MILS</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MILS) |

Advances in techniques such as image-to-image translation, text-to-image generation, domain transfer, and multimodal alignment have broadened the scope of automated visual content creation, supporting a wide spectrum of applications. These advancements are driven by models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), conditional frameworks, and diffusion-based approaches such as Stable Diffusion. This work presents a structured classification of image generation techniques based on the nature of the input, organizing methods by input modalities like noisy vectors, latent representations, and conditional inputs. We explore the principles behind these models, highlight key frameworks including DALL-E, ControlNet, and DeepSeek Janus-Pro, and address challenges such as computational costs, data biases, and output alignment with user intent. By offering this input-centric perspective, this study bridges technical depth with practical insights, providing researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive resource to harness generative AI for real-world applications.</p></details> | 53 pages, 18 figures | None |

| **[Polyp-Gen: Realistic and Diverse Polyp Image Generation for Endoscopic Dataset Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16679v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated diagnostic systems (ADS) have shown significant potential in the early detection of polyps during endoscopic examinations, thereby reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer. However, due to high annotation costs and strict privacy concerns, acquiring high-quality endoscopic images poses a considerable challenge in the development of ADS. Despite recent advancements in generating synthetic images for dataset expansion, existing endoscopic image generation algorithms failed to accurately generate the details of polyp boundary regions and typically required medical priors to specify plausible locations and shapes of polyps, which limited the realism and diversity of the generated images. To address these limitations, we present Polyp-Gen, the first full-automatic diffusion-based endoscopic image generation framework. Specifically, we devise a spatial-aware diffusion training scheme with a lesion-guided loss to enhance the structural context of polyp boundary regions. Moreover, to capture medical priors for the localization of potential polyp areas, we introduce a hierarchical retrieval-based sampling strategy to match similar fine-grained spatial features. In this way, our Polyp-Gen can generate realistic and diverse endoscopic images for building reliable ADS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art generation quality, and the synthetic images can improve the downstream polyp detection task. Additionally, our Polyp-Gen has shown remarkable zero-shot generalizability on other datasets.

| **[A Framework for Generating Realistic Synthetic Tabular Data in a Randomized Controlled Trial Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17719v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generation of realistic synthetic data has garnered considerable attention in recent years, particularly in the health research domain due to its utility in, for instance, sharing data while protecting patient privacy or determining optimal clinical trial design. While much work has been concentrated on synthetic image generation, generation of realistic and complex synthetic tabular data of the type most commonly encountered in classic epidemiological or clinical studies is still lacking, especially with regards to generating data for randomized controlled trials (RTCs). There is no consensus regarding the best way to generate synthetic tabular RCT data such that the underlying multivariate data distribution is preserved. Motivated by an RCT in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, we empirically compared the ability of several strategies and two generation techniques (one machine learning, the other a more classical statistical method) to faithfully reproduce realistic data. Our results suggest that using a sequential generation approach with a R-vine copula model to generate baseline variables, followed by a simple random treatment allocation to mimic the RCT setting, and subsequent regression models for variables post-treatment allocation (such as the trial outcome) is the most effective way to generate synthetic tabular RCT data that capture important and realistic features of the real data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Segmentation-Aware Generative Reinforcement Network (GRN) for Tissue Layer Segmentation in 3-D Ultrasound Images for Chronic Low-back Pain (cLBP) Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17690v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.</p></details> |  | None |
