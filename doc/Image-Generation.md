| **[A Generative Approach to High Fidelity 3D Reconstruction from Text Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03664v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of generative artificial intelligence and advanced computer vision technologies introduces a groundbreaking approach to transforming textual descriptions into three-dimensional representations. This research proposes a fully automated pipeline that seamlessly integrates text-to-image generation, various image processing techniques, and deep learning methods for reflection removal and 3D reconstruction. By leveraging state-of-the-art generative models like Stable Diffusion, the methodology translates natural language inputs into detailed 3D models through a multi-stage workflow. The reconstruction process begins with the generation of high-quality images from textual prompts, followed by enhancement by a reinforcement learning agent and reflection removal using the Stable Delight model. Advanced image upscaling and background removal techniques are then applied to further enhance visual fidelity. These refined two-dimensional representations are subsequently transformed into volumetric 3D models using sophisticated machine learning algorithms, capturing intricate spatial relationships and geometric characteristics. This process achieves a highly structured and detailed output, ensuring that the final 3D models reflect both semantic accuracy and geometric precision. This approach addresses key challenges in generative reconstruction, such as maintaining semantic coherence, managing geometric complexity, and preserving detailed visual information. Comprehensive experimental evaluations will assess reconstruction quality, semantic accuracy, and geometric fidelity across diverse domains and varying levels of complexity. By demonstrating the potential of AI-driven 3D reconstruction techniques, this research offers significant implications for fields such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and digital content creation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Safety Without Semantic Disruptions: Editing-free Safe Image Generation via Context-preserving Dual Latent Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13982v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training multimodal generative models on large, uncurated datasets can result in users being exposed to harmful, unsafe and controversial or culturally-inappropriate outputs. While model editing has been proposed to remove or filter undesirable concepts in embedding and latent spaces, it can inadvertently damage learned manifolds, distorting concepts in close semantic proximity. We identify limitations in current model editing techniques, showing that even benign, proximal concepts may become misaligned. To address the need for safe content generation, we leverage safe embeddings and a modified diffusion process with tunable weighted summation in the latent space to generate safer images. Our method preserves global context without compromising the structural integrity of the learned manifolds. We achieve state-of-the-art results on safe image generation benchmarks and offer intuitive control over the level of model safety. We identify trade-offs between safety and censorship, which presents a necessary perspective in the development of ethical AI models. We will release our code.

| **[Counting Guidance for High Fidelity Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17567v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been significant improvements in the quality and performance of text-to-image generation, largely due to the impressive results attained by diffusion models. However, text-to-image diffusion models sometimes struggle to create high-fidelity content for the given input prompt. One specific issue is their difficulty in generating the precise number of objects specified in the text prompt. For example, when provided with the prompt "five apples and ten lemons on a table," images generated by diffusion models often contain an incorrect number of objects. In this paper, we present a method to improve diffusion models so that they accurately produce the correct object count based on the input prompt. We adopt a counting network that performs reference-less class-agnostic counting for any given image. We calculate the gradients of the counting network and refine the predicted noise for each step. To address the presence of multiple types of objects in the prompt, we utilize novel attention map guidance to obtain high-quality masks for each object. Finally, we guide the denoising process using the calculated gradients for each object. Through extensive experiments and evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the fidelity of diffusion models with respect to object count.

| **[SCott: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Stochastic Consistency Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01505v4)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative sampling procedure employed by diffusion models (DMs) often leads to significant inference latency. To address this, we propose Stochastic Consistency Distillation (SCott) to enable accelerated text-to-image generation, where high-quality and diverse generations can be achieved within just 2-4 sampling steps. In contrast to vanilla consistency distillation (CD) which distills the ordinary differential equation solvers-based sampling process of a pre-trained teacher model into a student, SCott explores the possibility and validates the efficacy of integrating stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers into CD to fully unleash the potential of the teacher. SCott is augmented with elaborate strategies to control the noise strength and sampling process of the SDE solver. An adversarial loss is further incorporated to strengthen the consistency constraints in rare sampling steps. Empirically, on the MSCOCO-2017 5K dataset with a Stable Diffusion-V1.5 teacher, SCott achieves an FID of 21.9 with 2 sampling steps, surpassing that of the 1-step InstaFlow (23.4) and the 4-step UFOGen (22.1). Moreover, SCott can yield more diverse samples than other consistency models for high-resolution image generation, with up to 16% improvement in a qualified metric.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures | None |
| **[Schedule On the Fly: Diffusion Time Prediction for Faster and Better Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01243v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion and flow matching models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation. However, these models typically rely on the predetermined denoising schedules for all prompts. The multi-step reverse diffusion process can be regarded as a kind of chain-of-thought for generating high-quality images step by step. Therefore, diffusion models should reason for each instance to adaptively determine the optimal noise schedule, achieving high generation quality with sampling efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) for this. TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM using reinforcement learning to maximize a reward that encourages high final image quality while penalizing excessive denoising steps. With such an adaptive scheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely with human preferences but also adjusts diffusion time and the number of denoising steps on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. With Stable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of 5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer denoising steps to achieve better performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DP-LDMs: Differentially Private Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15759v6)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are one of the most widely used generative models for producing high quality images. However, a flurry of recent papers points out that DMs are least private forms of image generators, by extracting a significant number of near-identical replicas of training images from DMs. Existing privacy-enhancing techniques for DMs, unfortunately, do not provide a good privacy-utility tradeoff. In this paper, we aim to improve the current state of DMs with differential privacy (DP) by adopting the $\textit{Latent}$ Diffusion Models (LDMs). LDMs are equipped with powerful pre-trained autoencoders that map the high-dimensional pixels into lower-dimensional latent representations, in which DMs are trained, yielding a more efficient and fast training of DMs. Rather than fine-tuning the entire LDMs, we fine-tune only the $\textit{attention}$ modules of LDMs with DP-SGD, reducing the number of trainable parameters by roughly $90\%$ and achieving a better privacy-accuracy trade-off. Our approach allows us to generate realistic, high-dimensional images (256x256) conditioned on text prompts with DP guarantees, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been attempted before. Our approach provides a promising direction for training more powerful, yet training-efficient differentially private DMs, producing high-quality DP images. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DP-LDM-4525.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GenColor: Generative Color-Concept Association in Visual Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03236v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches for color-concept association typically rely on query-based image referencing, and color extraction from image references. However, these approaches are effective only for common concepts, and are vulnerable to unstable image referencing and varying image conditions. Our formative study with designers underscores the need for primary-accent color compositions and context-dependent colors (e.g., 'clear' vs. 'polluted' sky) in design. In response, we introduce a generative approach for mining semantically resonant colors leveraging images generated by text-to-image models. Our insight is that contemporary text-to-image models can resemble visual patterns from large-scale real-world data. The framework comprises three stages: concept instancing produces generative samples using diffusion models, text-guided image segmentation identifies concept-relevant regions within the image, and color association extracts primarily accompanied by accent colors. Quantitative comparisons with expert designs validate our approach's effectiveness, and we demonstrate the applicability through cases in various design scenarios and a gallery.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 16 figures.

| **[An Analytical Theory of Power Law Spectral Bias in the Learning Dynamics of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03206v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We developed an analytical framework for understanding how the learned distribution evolves during diffusion model training. Leveraging the Gaussian equivalence principle, we derived exact solutions for the gradient-flow dynamics of weights in one- or two-layer linear denoiser settings with arbitrary data. Remarkably, these solutions allowed us to derive the generated distribution in closed form and its KL divergence through training. These analytical results expose a pronounced power-law spectral bias, i.e., for weights and distributions, the convergence time of a mode follows an inverse power law of its variance. Empirical experiments on both Gaussian and image datasets demonstrate that the power-law spectral bias remains robust even when using deeper or convolutional architectures. Our results underscore the importance of the data covariance in dictating the order and rate at which diffusion models learn different modes of the data, providing potential explanations for why earlier stopping could lead to incorrect details in image generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Find Matching Faces Based On Face Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03204v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an innovative approach that enables the user to find matching faces based on the user-selected face parameters. Through gradio-based user interface, the users can interactively select the face parameters they want in their desired partner. These user-selected face parameters are transformed into a text prompt which is used by the Text-To-Image generation model to generate a realistic face image. Further, the generated image along with the images downloaded from the Jeevansathi.com are processed through face detection and feature extraction model, which results in high dimensional vector embedding of 512 dimensions. The vector embeddings generated from the downloaded images are stored into vector database. Now, the similarity search is carried out between the vector embedding of generated image and the stored vector embeddings. As a result, it displays the top five similar faces based on the user-selected face parameters. This contribution holds a significant potential to turn into a high-quality personalized face matching tool.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Architectural Sketch to Conceptual Representation: Using Structure-Aware Diffusion Model to Generate Renderings of School Buildings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03090v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, enabling the generation of renderings from architectural sketches. This progress has significantly improved the efficiency of communication and conceptual expression during the early stage of architectural design. However, generated images often lack the structural details from architects' sketches. While sketches typically emphasize the overall structure, crucial components such as windows and doors are often represented by simple lines or omitted entirely. For school buildings, it is essential to control architectural components, such as the shape and proportion of windows, as these factors directly influence the accuracy of the generated images in reflecting the architect's design intentions. To address this issue, we propose a structure-aware diffusion model for architectural image generation to refine expressing design intentions through retrieval augmentation. Our framework utilizes architectural components to enhance the generation process, addressing the details that may be lacking in the sketches. These components provide clear spatial and structural details, improving the model's ability to interpret and generate architectural details. The refined sketches, combined with text prompts, are fed into the proposed structure-aware diffusion model to generate detailed and realistic school building images. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating architectural designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, in Proceedings of CAADRIA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-View Depth Consistent Image Generation Using Generative AI Models: Application on Architectural Design of University Buildings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03068v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the early stages of architectural design, shoebox models are typically used as a simplified representation of building structures but require extensive operations to transform them into detailed designs. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising solution to automate this transformation, but ensuring multi-view consistency remains a significant challenge. To solve this issue, we propose a novel three-stage consistent image generation framework using generative AI models to generate architectural designs from shoebox model representations. The proposed method enhances state-of-the-art image generation diffusion models to generate multi-view consistent architectural images. We employ ControlNet as the backbone and optimize it to accommodate multi-view inputs of architectural shoebox models captured from predefined perspectives. To ensure stylistic and structural consistency across multi-view images, we propose an image space loss module that incorporates style loss, structural loss and angle alignment loss. We then use depth estimation method to extract depth maps from the generated multi-view images. Finally, we use the paired data of the architectural images and depth maps as inputs to improve the multi-view consistency via the depth-aware 3D attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate multi-view architectural images with consistent style and structural coherence from shoebox model inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, in Proceedings of CAADRIA2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Intent Understanding for Ambiguous prompt: A Human-Machine Co-Adaption Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15167v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's image generation systems are capable of producing realistic and high-quality images. However, user prompts often contain ambiguities, making it difficult for these systems to interpret users' actual intentions. Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset. Our annotation tools and several examples of our dataset are available at https://zenodo.org/records/14876029 for easier review. And we will open source our full dataset and code.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust time series generation via Schrödinger Bridge: a comprehensive evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02943v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |
| **[ARINAR: Bi-Level Autoregressive Feature-by-Feature Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02883v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing autoregressive (AR) image generative models use a token-by-token generation schema. That is, they predict a per-token probability distribution and sample the next token from that distribution. The main challenge is how to model the complex distribution of high-dimensional tokens. Previous methods either are too simplistic to fit the distribution or result in slow generation speed. Instead of fitting the distribution of the whole tokens, we explore using a AR model to generate each token in a feature-by-feature way, i.e., taking the generated features as input and generating the next feature. Based on that, we propose ARINAR (AR-in-AR), a bi-level AR model. The outer AR layer take previous tokens as input, predicts a condition vector z for the next token. The inner layer, conditional on z, generates features of the next token autoregressively. In this way, the inner layer only needs to model the distribution of a single feature, for example, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model. On the ImageNet 256x256 image generation task, ARINAR-B with 213M parameters achieves an FID of 2.75, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art MAR-B model (FID=2.31), while five times faster than the latter.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

| **[Feynman-Kac Correctors in Diffusion: Annealing, Guidance, and Product of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02819v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While score-based generative models are the model of choice across diverse domains, there are limited tools available for controlling inference-time behavior in a principled manner, e.g. for composing multiple pretrained models. Existing classifier-free guidance methods use a simple heuristic to mix conditional and unconditional scores to approximately sample from conditional distributions. However, such methods do not approximate the intermediate distributions, necessitating additional 'corrector' steps. In this work, we provide an efficient and principled method for sampling from a sequence of annealed, geometric-averaged, or product distributions derived from pretrained score-based models. We derive a weighted simulation scheme which we call Feynman-Kac Correctors (FKCs) based on the celebrated Feynman-Kac formula by carefully accounting for terms in the appropriate partial differential equations (PDEs). To simulate these PDEs, we propose Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) resampling algorithms that leverage inference-time scaling to improve sampling quality. We empirically demonstrate the utility of our methods by proposing amortized sampling via inference-time temperature annealing, improving multi-objective molecule generation using pretrained models, and improving classifier-free guidance for text-to-image generation.

| **[EC-DIT: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Adaptive Expert-Choice Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02098v5)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers have been widely adopted for text-to-image synthesis. While scaling these models up to billions of parameters shows promise, the effectiveness of scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational heterogeneity of image generations, we develop a new family of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (EC-DIT) for diffusion transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns to adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the input texts and generate the respective image patches, enabling heterogeneous computation aligned with varying text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters and achieving significant improvements in training convergence, text-to-image alignment, and overall generation quality over dense models and conventional MoE models. Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates superior scalability and adaptive compute allocation by recognizing varying textual importance through end-to-end training. Notably, in text-to-image alignment evaluation, our largest models achieve a state-of-the-art GenEval score of 71.68% and still maintain competitive inference speed with intuitive interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Undertrained Image Reconstruction for Realistic Degradation in Blind Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02767v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most super-resolution (SR) models struggle with real-world low-resolution (LR) images. This issue arises because the degradation characteristics in the synthetic datasets differ from those in real-world LR images. Since SR models are trained on pairs of high-resolution (HR) and LR images generated by downsampling, they are optimized for simple degradation. However, real-world LR images contain complex degradation caused by factors such as the imaging process and JPEG compression. Due to these differences in degradation characteristics, most SR models perform poorly on real-world LR images. This study proposes a dataset generation method using undertrained image reconstruction models. These models have the property of reconstructing low-quality images with diverse degradation from input images. By leveraging this property, this study generates LR images with diverse degradation from HR images to construct the datasets. Fine-tuning pre-trained SR models on our generated datasets improves noise removal and blur reduction, enhancing performance on real-world LR images. Furthermore, an analysis of the datasets reveals that degradation diversity contributes to performance improvements, whereas color differences between HR and LR images may degrade performance. 11 pages, (11 figures and 2 tables)</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/vila-u.

| **[Learning Mixtures of Gaussians Using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18869v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give a new algorithm for learning mixtures of $k$ Gaussians (with identity covariance in $\mathbb{R}^n$) to TV error $\varepsilon$, with quasi-polynomial ($O(n^{\text{poly\,log}\left(\frac{n+k}{\varepsilon}\right)})$) time and sample complexity, under a minimum weight assumption. Our results extend to continuous mixtures of Gaussians where the mixing distribution is supported on a union of $k$ balls of constant radius. In particular, this applies to the case of Gaussian convolutions of distributions on low-dimensional manifolds, or more generally sets with small covering number, for which no sub-exponential algorithm was previously known. Unlike previous approaches, most of which are algebraic in nature, our approach is analytic and relies on the framework of diffusion models. Diffusion models are a modern paradigm for generative modeling, which typically rely on learning the score function (gradient log-pdf) along a process transforming a pure noise distribution, in our case a Gaussian, to the data distribution. Despite their dazzling performance in tasks such as image generation, there are few end-to-end theoretical guarantees that they can efficiently learn nontrivial families of distributions; we give some of the first such guarantees. We proceed by deriving higher-order Gaussian noise sensitivity bounds for the score functions for a Gaussian mixture to show that that they can be inductively learned using piecewise polynomial regression (up to poly-logarithmic degree), and combine this with known convergence results for diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generative Modeling of Microweather Wind Velocities for Urban Air Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02690v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the pursuit of safe, reliable, and weather-tolerant urban air mobility (UAM) solutions, this work proposes a generative modeling approach for characterizing microweather wind velocities. Microweather, or the weather conditions in highly localized areas, is particularly complex in urban environments owing to the chaotic and turbulent nature of wind flows. Furthermore, traditional means of assessing local wind fields are not generally viable solutions for UAM applications: 1) field measurements that would rely on permanent wind profiling systems in operational air space are not practical, 2) physics-based models that simulate fluid dynamics at a sufficiently high resolution are not computationally tractable, and 3) data-driven modeling approaches that are largely deterministic ignore the inherent variability in turbulent flows that dictates UAM reliability. Thus, advancements in predictive capabilities are needed to help mitigate the unique operational safety risks that microweather winds pose for smaller, lighter weight UAM aircraft. This work aims to model microweather wind velocities in a manner that is computationally-efficient, captures random variability, and would only require a temporary, rather than permanent, field measurement campaign. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in conditional generative AI such as text-to-image generation, the proposed approach learns a probabilistic macro-to-microweather mapping between regional weather forecasts and measured local wind velocities using generative modeling (denoising diffusion probabilistic models, flow matching, and Gaussian mixture models). A simple proof of concept was implemented using a dataset comprised of local (micro) measurements from a Sonic Detection and Ranging (SoDAR) wind profiler along with (macro) forecast data from a nearby weather station over the same time period.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, published in 2025 IEEE Aerospace Conference proceedings</p></details> | None |

The proposed process aligns well with the noise sensitivity characteristic of molecular structures and uniformly distributes reconstruction effort across the generative process, thus enhancing learning efficiency and efficacy. Consequently, SLDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D molecule generation benchmarks, delivering a 100-fold improvement in sampling efficiency. Furthermore, experiments on toy data and image generation tasks validate the generality and robustness of SLDM, showcasing its potential across diverse generative modeling domains.</p></details> |  | None |

To have negative guidance, Smooth Perturbation Guidance (SPG) builds a weak model by temporally smoothing the motion in the denoising steps. Compared to model-agnostic methods originating from the image generation field, SPG effectively mitigates out-of-distribution issues when perturbing motion diffusion models. In SPG guidance, the nature of motion structure remains intact. This work conducts a comprehensive analysis across distinct model architectures and tasks. Despite its extremely simple implementation and no need for additional training requirements, SPG consistently enhances motion fidelity.

| **[PVTree: Realistic and Controllable Palm Vein Generation for Recognition Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02547v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Palm vein recognition is an emerging biometric technology that offers enhanced security and privacy. However, acquiring sufficient palm vein data for training deep learning-based recognition models is challenging due to the high costs of data collection and privacy protection constraints. This has led to a growing interest in generating pseudo-palm vein data using generative models. Existing methods, however, often produce unrealistic palm vein patterns or struggle with controlling identity and style attributes. To address these issues, we propose a novel palm vein generation framework named PVTree. First, the palm vein identity is defined by a complex and authentic 3D palm vascular tree, created using an improved Constrained Constructive Optimization (CCO) algorithm. Second, palm vein patterns of the same identity are generated by projecting the same 3D vascular tree into 2D images from different views and converting them into realistic images using a generative model. As a result, PVTree satisfies the need for both identity consistency and intra-class diversity. Extensive experiments conducted on several publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed palm vein generation method surpasses existing methods and achieves a higher TAR@FAR=1e-4 under the 1:1 Open-set protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the performance of a recognition model trained on synthetic palm vein data exceeds that of the recognition model trained on real data, which indicates that palm vein image generation research has a promising future.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their performance notably declines when generating images at resolutions higher than those used during the training period. Despite the existence of numerous methods for producing high-resolution images, they either suffer from inefficiency or are hindered by complex operations. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, an efficient and straightforward solution for training-free high-resolution image generation. Specifically, we introduce the noise refresh strategy, which theoretically only requires a few lines of code to unlock the model's high-resolution generation ability and improve efficiency. Additionally, we first observe the phenomenon of energy decay that may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution image generation process. To address this issue, we propose an Energy Rectification strategy, where modifying the hyperparameters of the classifier-free guidance effectively improves the generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and boasts a simple implementation logic. Through extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods, our RectifiedHR demonstrates superior effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zhenyangcs.github.io/RectifiedHR-Diffusion/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zhenyangcs.github.io/RectifiedHR-Diffusion) |

However, the promoting effect of combining the two mechanisms on efficient generation remains under-explored. Through empirical investigation, we find that the combination of quantization and cache mechanisms for DiT is not straightforward, and two key challenges lead to severe catastrophic performance degradation: (i) the sample efficacy of calibration datasets in post-training quantization (PTQ) is significantly eliminated by cache operation; (ii) the combination of the above mechanisms introduces more severe exposure bias within sampling distribution, resulting in amplified error accumulation in the image generation process. In this work, we take advantage of these two acceleration mechanisms and propose a hybrid acceleration method by tackling the above challenges, aiming to further improve the efficiency of DiTs while maintaining excellent generation capability. Concretely, a temporal-aware parallel clustering (TAP) is designed to dynamically improve the sample selection efficacy for the calibration within PTQ for different diffusion steps. A variance compensation (VC) strategy is derived to correct the sampling distribution. It mitigates exposure bias through an adaptive correction factor generation. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has accelerated DiTs by 12.7x while preserving competitive generation capability.

However, their lengthy denoising process and computationally intensive score estimation network impede their scalability in low-latency and resource-constrained scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses and accelerates diffusion models without retraining, but it inevitably introduces additional quantization noise, resulting in mean and variance deviations. In this work, we propose D2-DPM, a dual denoising mechanism aimed at precisely mitigating the adverse effects of quantization noise on the noise estimation network. Specifically, we first unravel the impact of quantization noise on the sampling equation into two components: the mean deviation and the variance deviation. The mean deviation alters the drift coefficient of the sampling equation, influencing the trajectory trend, while the variance deviation magnifies the diffusion coefficient, impacting the convergence of the sampling trajectory. The proposed D2-DPM is thus devised to denoise the quantization noise at each time step, and then denoise the noisy sample through the inverse diffusion iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that D2-DPM achieves superior generation quality, yielding a 1.42 lower FID than the full-precision model while achieving 3.99x compression and 11.67x bit-operation acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, acceptted by AAAI2025, the code is available at https://github.com/taylorjocelyn/d2-dpm</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/taylorjocelyn/d2-dpm) |

However, $\ell_p$ threat models cannot capture all relevant semantics-preserving perturbations, and hence, the scope of robustness evaluations is limited. In this work, we introduce Score-Based Adversarial Generation (ScoreAG), a novel framework that leverages the advancements in score-based generative models to generate unrestricted adversarial examples that overcome the limitations of $\ell_p$-norm constraints. Unlike traditional methods, ScoreAG maintains the core semantics of images while generating adversarial examples, either by transforming existing images or synthesizing new ones entirely from scratch. We further exploit the generative capability of ScoreAG to purify images, empirically enhancing the robustness of classifiers. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that ScoreAG improves upon the majority of state-of-the-art attacks and defenses across multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the importance of investigating adversarial examples bounded by semantics rather than $\ell_p$-norm constraints. ScoreAG represents an important step towards more encompassing robustness assessments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Teaching Metric Distance to Autoregressive Multimodal Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02379v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are pronounced in cases of limited training data, highlighting DIST2Loss's effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these advances are hindered by two main challenges: firstly, the need to accurately maintain the details of each referenced subject in accordance with the textual descriptions; and secondly, the difficulty in achieving a cohesive representation of multiple subjects in a single image without introducing inconsistencies. To address these concerns, our research introduces the MS-Diffusion framework for layout-guided zero-shot image personalization with multi-subjects. This innovative approach integrates grounding tokens with the feature resampler to maintain detail fidelity among subjects. With the layout guidance, MS-Diffusion further improves the cross-attention to adapt to the multi-subject inputs, ensuring that each subject condition acts on specific areas. The proposed multi-subject cross-attention orchestrates harmonious inter-subject compositions while preserving the control of texts. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments affirm that this method surpasses existing models in both image and text fidelity, promoting the development of personalized text-to-image generation.

| **[Accelerating Auto-regressive Text-to-Image Generation with Training-free Speculative Jacobi Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01699v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current large auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, high-resolution images, but these models require hundreds or even thousands of steps of next-token prediction during inference, resulting in substantial time consumption. In existing studies, Jacobi decoding, an iterative parallel decoding algorithm, has been used to accelerate the auto-regressive generation and can be executed without training. However, the Jacobi decoding relies on a deterministic criterion to determine the convergence of iterations. Thus, it works for greedy decoding but is incompatible with sampling-based decoding which is crucial for visual quality and diversity in the current auto-regressive text-to-image generation. In this paper, we propose a training-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm, Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD), to accelerate auto-regressive text-to-image generation. By introducing a probabilistic convergence criterion, our SJD accelerates the inference of auto-regressive text-to-image generation while maintaining the randomness in sampling-based token decoding and allowing the model to generate diverse images. Specifically, SJD facilitates the model to predict multiple tokens at each step and accepts tokens based on the probabilistic criterion, enabling the model to generate images with fewer steps than the conventional next-token-prediction paradigm. We also investigate the token initialization strategies that leverage the spatial locality of visual data to further improve the acceleration ratio under specific scenarios. We conduct experiments for our proposed SJD on multiple auto-regressive text-to-image generation models, showing the effectiveness of model acceleration without sacrificing the visual quality.

| **[Finding Local Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19754v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image generation, Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB)-based methods theoretically enhance the efficiency and quality compared to the diffusion models by finding the least costly path between two distributions. However, they are computationally expensive and time-consuming when applied to complex image data. The reason is that they focus on fitting globally optimal paths in high-dimensional spaces, directly generating images as next step on the path using complex networks through self-supervised training, which typically results in a gap with the global optimum. Meanwhile, most diffusion models are in the same path subspace generated by weights $f_A(t)$ and $f_B(t)$, as they follow the paradigm ($x_t = f_A(t)x_{Img} + f_B(t)\epsilon$). To address the limitations of SB-based methods, this paper proposes for the first time to find local Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridges (LDSB) in the diffusion path subspace, which strengthens the connection between the SB problem and diffusion models. Specifically, our method optimizes the diffusion paths using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which has the advantage of resistance to forgetting and continuous output. The experiment shows that our LDSB significantly improves the quality and efficiency of image generation using the same pre-trained denoising network and the KAN for optimising is only less than 0.1MB. The FID metric is reduced by more than 15\%, especially with a reduction of 48.50\% when NFE of DDIM is $5$ for the CelebA dataset.

| **[Language-Guided Visual Perception Disentanglement for Image Quality Assessment and Conditional Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02206v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated excellent zero-shot capability across semantic recognition tasks, mainly attributed to the training on a large-scale I&1T (one Image with one Text) dataset. This kind of multimodal representations often blend semantic and perceptual elements, placing a particular emphasis on semantics. However, this could be problematic for popular tasks like image quality assessment (IQA) and conditional image generation (CIG), which typically need to have fine control on perceptual and semantic features. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents a new multimodal disentangled representation learning framework, which leverages disentangled text to guide image disentanglement. To this end, we first build an I&2T (one Image with a perceptual Text and a semantic Text) dataset, which consists of disentangled perceptual and semantic text descriptions for an image. Then, the disentangled text descriptions are utilized as supervisory signals to disentangle pure perceptual representations from CLIP's original `coarse' feature space, dubbed DeCLIP. Finally, the decoupled feature representations are used for both image quality assessment (technical quality and aesthetic quality) and conditional image generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method on the two popular tasks. The dataset, code, and model will be available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Modular Conversational Agents for Surveys and Interviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17049v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surveys and interviews are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant public and environmental stakes, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents, underscoring the need for a rigorous, resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resulting parameterized process for designing AI agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultation about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Scalable Topological Regularizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14641v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent space matching, which consists of matching distributions of features in latent space, is a crucial component for tasks such as adversarial attacks and defenses, domain adaptation, and generative modelling. Metrics for probability measures, such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy, are commonly used to quantify the differences between such distributions. However, these are often costly to compute, or do not appropriately take the geometric and topological features of the distributions into consideration. Persistent homology is a tool from topological data analysis which quantifies the multi-scale topological structure of point clouds, and has recently been used as a topological regularizer in learning tasks. However, computation costs preclude larger scale computations, and discontinuities in the gradient lead to unstable training behavior such as in adversarial tasks. We propose the use of principal persistence measures, based on computing the persistent homology of a large number of small subsamples, as a topological regularizer. We provide a parallelized GPU implementation of this regularizer, and prove that gradients are continuous for smooth densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this regularizer on shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning tasks, opening the door towards a scalable regularizer for topological features.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, ICLR 2025 camera-ready version</p></details> | None |

To enable the diffusion model to learn spatial information to improve the quality of the hands generated, we propose HanDrawer, a module to condition the hand generation process. Specifically, we apply graph convolutional layers to extract the endogenous spatial structure and physical constraints implicit in MANO hand mesh vertices. We then align and fuse these spatial features with other modalities via cross-attention. The spatially fused features are used to guide a single stage diffusion model denoising process for high quality generation of the hand region. To improve the accuracy of spatial feature fusion, we propose a Position-Preserving Zero Padding (PPZP) fusion strategy, which ensures that the features extracted by HanDrawer are fused into the region of interest in the relevant layers of the diffusion model. HanDrawer learns the entire image features while paying special attention to the hand region thanks to an additional hand reconstruction loss combined with the denoising loss. To accurately train and evaluate our approach, we perform careful cleansing and relabeling of the widely used HaGRID hand gesture dataset and obtain high quality multimodal data. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on the HaGRID dataset through multiple evaluation metrics. Source code and our enhanced dataset will be released publicly if the paper is accepted.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

Although diffusion models have demonstrated superior performance in robot learning due to their task scalability and multi-modal flexibility, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) they often produce non-smooth, jerky motions due to their inability to capture temporally consistent movement dynamics, and (2) their iterative sampling process incurs prohibitive latency for many robotic tasks. Inspired by classic robot motion generation methods such as DMPs and ProMPs, which capture temporally and spatially consistent dynamic of trajectories using low-dimensional vectors -- and by recent advances in diffusion-based image generation that use consistency models with probability flow ODEs to accelerate the denoising process, we propose Fast Robot Motion Diffusion (FRMD). FRMD uniquely integrates Movement Primitives (MPs) with Consistency Models to enable efficient, single-step trajectory generation. By leveraging probabilistic flow ODEs and consistency distillation, our method models trajectory distributions while learning a compact, time-continuous motion representation within an encoder-decoder architecture. This unified approach eliminates the slow, multi-step denoising process of conventional diffusion models, enabling efficient one-step inference and smooth robot motion generation. We extensively evaluated our FRMD on the well-recognized Meta-World and ManiSkills Benchmarks, ranging from simple to more complex manipulation tasks, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that FRMD generates significantly faster, smoother trajectories while achieving higher success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.01586 by other authors</p></details> | None |

Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods do not incorporate tactile information, leading to designs that lack the expected tactile properties. We present TactStyle, a system that allows creators to stylize 3D models with images while incorporating the expected tactile properties. TactStyle accomplishes this using a modified image-generation model fine-tuned to generate heightfields for given surface textures. By optimizing 3D model surfaces to embody a generated texture, TactStyle creates models that match the desired style and replicate the tactile experience. We utilize a large-scale dataset of textures to train our texture generation model. In a psychophysical experiment, we evaluate the tactile qualities of a set of 3D-printed original textures and TactStyle's generated textures. Our results show that TactStyle successfully generates a wide range of tactile features from a single image input, enabling a novel approach to haptic design.</p></details> |  | None |

These models follow a one-stage framework: Encouraging the model to focus the attention map of each concept on its corresponding region by defining attention map-based losses. However, these models still struggle to accurately follow layouts with significant overlap, often leading to issues like attribute leakage and missing entities. In this paper, we propose ToLo, a two-stage, training-free layout-to-image generation framework for high-overlap layouts. Our framework consists of two stages: the aggregation stage and the separation stage, each with its own loss function based on the attention map. To provide a more effective evaluation, we partition the HRS dataset based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the input layouts, creating a new dataset for layout-to-image generation with varying levels of overlap. Through extensive experiments on this dataset, we demonstrate that ToLo significantly enhances the performance of existing methods when dealing with high-overlap layouts.

To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end, one-stage diffusion-based framework that avoids intricate components like position and layout modeling. Specifically, the proposed framework directly synthesizes textual and visual design elements from user prompts. It utilizes a distinctive character embedding derived from the visual text to enhance the input prompt, along with a character localization loss for enhanced supervision during text generation.

To further equip these T2I models with fine-grained spatial control, approaches like ControlNet introduce an extra network that learns to follow a condition image. However, for every single condition type, ControlNet requires independent training on millions of data pairs with hundreds of GPU hours, which is quite expensive and makes it challenging for ordinary users to explore and develop new types of conditions. To address this problem, we propose the CtrLoRA framework, which trains a Base ControlNet to learn the common knowledge of image-to-image generation from multiple base conditions, along with condition-specific LoRAs to capture distinct characteristics of each condition. Utilizing our pretrained Base ControlNet, users can easily adapt it to new conditions, requiring as few as 1,000 data pairs and less than one hour of single-GPU training to obtain satisfactory results in most scenarios. Moreover, our CtrLoRA reduces the learnable parameters by 90% compared to ControlNet, significantly lowering the threshold to distribute and deploy the model weights.

Existing methods typically treat them separately, struggling with limited high-quality data and poor generalization. However, both tasks require capturing complex visual variations while maintaining consistency between inputs and outputs. Therefore, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that standardizes task representations using multimodal instructions. It treats subject-driven generation as creation on a blank canvas and instruction-based editing as modification of an existing image, establishing a shared input-output formulation. MIGE introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps free-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space, integrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism. This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: By leveraging shared visual and semantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and visual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing. (2) Generalization: Learning in a unified format facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel compositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing. Experiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing while setting a state-of-the-art in the new task of instruction-based subject-driven editing.

However, they tend to underperform when generating intricate images with various interwoven conditions, which is hard to solely rely on straightforward text-to-image generation. In response to this challenge, we introduce MINT, an innovative unified generative model, empowered with native multimodal chain of thought (MCoT) for enhanced image generation for the first time. Firstly, we design Mixture of Transformer Experts (MTXpert), an expert-parallel structure that effectively supports both natural language generation (NLG) and visual capabilities, while avoiding potential modality conflicts that could hinder the full potential of each modality. Building on this, we propose an innovative MCoT training paradigm, a step-by-step approach to multimodal thinking, reasoning, and reflection specifically designed to enhance image generation. This paradigm equips MINT with nuanced, element-wise decoupled alignment and a comprehensive understanding of textual and visual components. Furthermore, it fosters advanced multimodal reasoning and self-reflection, enabling the construction of images that are firmly grounded in the logical relationships between these elements. Notably, MINT has been validated to exhibit superior performance across multiple benchmarks for text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-text (I2T) tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-Grained Controllable Apparel Showcase Image Generation via Garment-Centric Outpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01294v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel garment-centric outpainting (GCO) framework based on the latent diffusion model (LDM) for fine-grained controllable apparel showcase image generation. The proposed framework aims at customizing a fashion model wearing a given garment via text prompts and facial images. Different from existing methods, our framework takes a garment image segmented from a dressed mannequin or a person as the input, eliminating the need for learning cloth deformation and ensuring faithful preservation of garment details. The proposed framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a garment-adaptive pose prediction model that generates diverse poses given the garment. Then, in the next stage, we generate apparel showcase images, conditioned on the garment and the predicted poses, along with specified text prompts and facial images. Notably, a multi-scale appearance customization module (MS-ACM) is designed to allow both overall and fine-grained text-based control over the generated model's appearance. Moreover, we leverage a lightweight feature fusion operation without introducing any extra encoders or modules to integrate multiple conditions, which is more efficient. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Improved Text-Aligned Codebook Learning: Multi-Hierarchical Codebook-Text Alignment with Long Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01261v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quantization is a crucial technique in image generation, aimed at learning a codebook that encodes an image into a discrete token sequence. Recent advancements have seen researchers exploring learning multi-modal codebook (i.e., text-aligned codebook) by utilizing image caption semantics, aiming to enhance codebook performance in cross-modal tasks. However, existing image-text paired datasets exhibit a notable flaw in that the text descriptions tend to be overly concise, failing to adequately describe the images and provide sufficient semantic knowledge, resulting in limited alignment of text and codebook at a fine-grained level. In this paper, we propose a novel Text-Augmented Codebook Learning framework, named TA-VQ, which generates longer text for each image using the visual-language model for improved text-aligned codebook learning. However, the long text presents two key challenges: how to encode text and how to align codebook and text. To tackle two challenges, we propose to split the long text into multiple granularities for encoding, i.e., word, phrase, and sentence, so that the long text can be fully encoded without losing any key semantic knowledge. Following this, a hierarchical encoder and novel sampling-based alignment strategy are designed to achieve fine-grained codebook-text alignment. Additionally, our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing VQ models. Extensive experiments in reconstruction and various downstream tasks demonstrate its effectiveness compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Low-Biased General Annotated Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10831v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training backbone networks on a general annotated dataset (e.g., ImageNet) that comprises numerous manually collected images with category annotations has proven to be indispensable for enhancing the generalization capacity of downstream visual tasks. However, those manually collected images often exhibit bias, which is non-transferable across either categories or domains, thus causing the model's generalization capacity degeneration. To mitigate this problem, we present an low-biased general annotated dataset generation framework (lbGen). Instead of expensive manual collection, we aim at directly generating low-biased images with category annotations. To achieve this goal, we propose to leverage the advantage of a multimodal foundation model (e.g., CLIP), in terms of aligning images in an low-biased semantic space defined by language. Specifically, we develop a bi-level semantic alignment loss, which not only forces all generated images to be consistent with the semantic distribution of all categories belonging to the target dataset in an adversarial learning manner, but also requires each generated image to match the semantic description of its category name. In addition, we further cast an existing image quality scoring model into a quality assurance loss to preserve the quality of the generated image. By leveraging these two loss functions, we can obtain an low-biased image generation model by simply fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model using only all category names in the target dataset as input. Experimental results confirm that, compared with the manually labeled dataset or other synthetic datasets, the utilization of our generated low-biased datasets leads to stable generalization capacity enhancement of different backbone networks across various tasks, especially in tasks where the manually labeled samples are scarce.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

To address this, we propose Retinal Layout-Aware Diffusion (RLAD), a novel diffusion-based framework for generating controllable layout-aware images. RLAD conditions image generation on multiple key layout components extracted from real images, ensuring high structural fidelity while enabling diversity in other components. Applied to retinal fundus imaging, we augmented the training datasets by synthesizing paired retinal images and vessel segmentations conditioned on extracted blood vessels from real images, while varying other layout components such as lesions and the optic disc. Experiments demonstrated that RLAD-generated data improved generalization in retinal vessel segmentation by up to 8.1%. Furthermore, we present REYIA, a comprehensive dataset comprising 586 manually segmented retinal images. To foster reproducibility and drive innovation, both our code and dataset will be made publicly accessible.</p></details> |  | None |

With advances in multimodal generative models, a natural solution is to generate synthetic samples with subtle variations for training VLMs. However, generating and training on synthetic samples with subtle variations presents two challenges: difficulty in accurately creating precise variations and inconsistency in cross-modal alignment quality. To address these challenges, we propose SVD-GT (Subtle Variation Data Generation and Training), which integrates image feature injection into a text-to-image generative model to enhance the quality of synthetic variations and employs an adaptive margin loss to differentiate samples using adaptive margins, which help filter out potentially incorrect synthetic samples and focus the learning on informative hard samples. Evaluations on four compositional understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SVD-GT significantly improves the compositionality of VLMs, boosting the average accuracy of CLIP by over 8% across all benchmarks and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2% on three benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tuning Timestep-Distilled Diffusion Model Using Pairwise Sample Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03190v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in timestep-distilled diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation that rivals non-distilled multi-step models, but with significantly fewer inference steps. While such models are attractive for applications due to the low inference cost and latency, fine-tuning them with a naive diffusion objective would result in degraded and blurry outputs. An intuitive alternative is to repeat the diffusion distillation process with a fine-tuned teacher model, which produces good results but is cumbersome and computationally intensive; the distillation training usually requires magnitude higher of training compute compared to fine-tuning for specific image styles. In this paper, we present an algorithm named pairwise sample optimization (PSO), which enables the direct fine-tuning of an arbitrary timestep-distilled diffusion model. PSO introduces additional reference images sampled from the current time-step distilled model, and increases the relative likelihood margin between the training images and reference images. This enables the model to retain its few-step generation ability, while allowing for fine-tuning of its output distribution. We also demonstrate that PSO is a generalized formulation which can be flexibly extended to both offline-sampled and online-sampled pairwise data, covering various popular objectives for diffusion model preference optimization. We evaluate PSO in both preference optimization and other fine-tuning tasks, including style transfer and concept customization. We show that PSO can directly adapt distilled models to human-preferred generation with both offline and online-generated pairwise preference image data. PSO also demonstrates effectiveness in style transfer and concept customization by directly tuning timestep-distilled diffusion models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a key challenge in image personalization is the issue of conceptual coupling, where the limited number of reference images leads the model to form unwanted associations between the personalization target and other concepts. Current methods attempt to tackle this issue indirectly, leading to a suboptimal balance between text control and personalization fidelity. In this paper, we take a direct approach to the concept coupling problem through statistical analysis, revealing that it stems from two distinct sources of dependence discrepancies. We therefore propose two complementary plug-and-play loss functions: Denoising Decouple Loss and Prior Decouple loss, each designed to minimize one type of dependence discrepancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior trade-off between text control and personalization fidelity.</p></details> |  | None |

However, learning the underlying SDE from data is a challenging task, especially if individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution lacks any generalized rotational symmetries. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that APPEX iteratively decreases Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true solution, and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</p></details> |  | None |

This gap hinders the model's ability to synthesize coherent and novel visual representations from textual prompts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multi-modal learning. In this work, we propose MedUnifier, a unified VLP framework tailored for medical data. MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. MedUnifier also offers a highly adaptable tool for a wide range of language and vision tasks in healthcare, marking advancement toward the development of a generalizable AI model for medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be pubilshed in CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, they suffer from various shortcomings, like a bias towards specific generators and datasets. To address this problem, we propose the Fr\'echet Wavelet Distance (FWD) as a domain-agnostic metric based on the Wavelet Packet Transform ($W_p$). FWD provides a sight across a broad spectrum of frequencies in images with a high resolution, preserving both spatial and textural aspects. Specifically, we use $W_p$ to project generated and real images to the packet coefficient space. We then compute the Fr\'echet distance with the resultant coefficients to evaluate the quality of a generator. This metric is general-purpose and dataset-domain agnostic, as it does not rely on any pre-trained network, while being more interpretable due to its ability to compute Fr\'echet distance per packet, enhancing transparency. We conclude with an extensive evaluation of a wide variety of generators across various datasets that the proposed FWD can generalize and improve robustness to domain shifts and various corruptions compared to other metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Using Synthetic Images to Augment Small Medical Image Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00962v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing academic and industrial interest in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging. To perform well, DL models require very large labeled datasets. However, most medical imaging datasets are small, with a limited number of annotated samples. The reason they are small is usually because delineating medical images is time-consuming and demanding for oncologists. There are various techniques that can be used to augment a dataset, for example, to apply affine transformations or elastic transformations to available images, or to add synthetic images generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In this work, we have developed a novel conditional variant of a current GAN method, the StyleGAN2, to generate multi-modal high-resolution medical images with the purpose to augment small medical imaging datasets with these synthetic images. We use the synthetic and real images from six datasets to train models for the downstream task of semantic segmentation. The quality of the generated medical images and the effect of this augmentation on the segmentation performance were evaluated afterward. Finally, the results indicate that the downstream segmentation models did not benefit from the generated images. Further work and analyses are required to establish how this augmentation affects the segmentation performance.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360{\deg} panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://stochsync.github.io/ (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

Typically, these prompts are extended to a fixed length by adding padding tokens before text encoding. Despite being a default practice, the influence of padding tokens on the image generation process has not been investigated. In this work, we conduct the first in-depth analysis of the role padding tokens play in T2I models. We develop two causal techniques to analyze how information is encoded in the representation of tokens across different components of the T2I pipeline. Using these techniques, we investigate when and how padding tokens impact the image generation process. Our findings reveal three distinct scenarios: padding tokens may affect the model's output during text encoding, during the diffusion process, or be effectively ignored. Moreover, we identify key relationships between these scenarios and the model's architecture (cross or self-attention) and its training process (frozen or trained text encoder). These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of padding tokens, potentially informing future model design and training practices in T2I systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: NAACL 2025.

However, the application of next-token prediction to high-resolution text-to-image generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{D-JEPA$\cdot$T2I}, an autoregressive model based on continuous tokens that incorporates innovations in both architecture and training strategy to generate high-quality, photorealistic images at arbitrary resolutions, up to 4K. Architecturally, we adopt the denoising joint embedding predictive architecture (D-JEPA) while leveraging a multimodal visual transformer to effectively integrate textual and visual features. Additionally, we introduce flow matching loss alongside the proposed Visual Rotary Positional Embedding (VoPE) to enable continuous resolution learning. In terms of training strategy, we propose a data feedback mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sampling procedure based on statistical analysis and an online learning critic model. This encourages the model to move beyond its comfort zone, reducing redundant training on well-mastered scenarios and compelling it to address more challenging cases with suboptimal generation quality. For the first time, we achieve state-of-the-art high-resolution image synthesis via next-token prediction.</p></details> | 31 pages | None |

Initially, we equivalently decompose the weights of LoRA into two subspaces, and find that simply mixing them can enhance performance. To study such a phenomenon, we revisit it through a fine-grained subspace lens, showing that such modification is equivalent to employing a fixed mixer to fuse the subspaces. To be more flexible, we jointly learn the mixer with the original LoRA weights, and term the method Mixture-of-Subspaces LoRA (MoSLoRA).

We propose to reformulate the video generation problem as a non-quantized autoregressive modeling of temporal frame-by-frame prediction and spatial set-by-set prediction. Unlike raster-scan prediction in prior autoregressive models or joint distribution modeling of fixed-length tokens in diffusion models, our approach maintains the causal property of GPT-style models for flexible in-context capabilities, while leveraging bidirectional modeling within individual frames for efficiency. With the proposed approach, we train a novel video autoregressive model without vector quantization, termed NOVA. Our results demonstrate that NOVA surpasses prior autoregressive video models in data efficiency, inference speed, visual fidelity, and video fluency, even with a much smaller model capacity, i.e., 0.6B parameters. NOVA also outperforms state-of-the-art image diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks, with a significantly lower training cost.

In this work, we focus on bridging this gap through integrating two enhanced features: (1) comprehending images of arbitrary sizes and ratios, and (2) enabling multi-granularity image generation. We present a unified and versatile foundation model, namely, SEED-X, which is able to model multi-granularity visual semantics for comprehension and generation tasks.

However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature, which processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to models like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently. While speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by generating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in this setting, which we term \textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual AR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering the performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose a relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the interchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the effectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more flexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected. Furthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that these speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality or semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding. In specific, compared to a na\"ive application of the state-of-the-art speculative decoding, LANTERN increases speed-ups by $\mathbf{1.75}\times$ and $\mathbf{1.82}\times$, as compared to greedy decoding and random sampling, respectively, when applied to LlamaGen, a contemporary visual AR model.

This stochastic process traces a path in probability space, evolving from the original data distribution (considered as a Gaussian with near-zero variance) to an isotropic Gaussian. The denoiser then learns to reverse this process, generating high-quality samples from random Gaussian noise. However, standard diffusion models, such as the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), do not ensure a geodesic (i.e., shortest) path in probability space. This inefficiency necessitates the use of many intermediate time steps, leading to high computational costs in training and sampling. To address this limitation, we propose the Geodesic Diffusion Model (GDM), which defines a geodesic path under the Fisher-Rao metric with a variance-exploding noise scheduler. This formulation transforms the data distribution into a Gaussian prior with minimal energy, significantly improving the efficiency of diffusion models. We trained GDM by continuously sampling time steps from 0 to 1 and using as few as 15 evenly spaced time steps for model sampling. We evaluated GDM on two medical image-to-image generation tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by a 50-fold compared to DDPM and 10-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, with 66 times faster sampling than DDPM and a similar sampling speed to Fast-DDPM. These efficiency gains enable rapid model exploration and real-time clinical applications.

However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p></details> |  | None |

Methods A modified CycleGAN architecture was trained on paired DRR-FPD image data obtained from patients with lung tumors. The training dataset consisted of over 400 DRR-FPD image pairs, and the final model was evaluated on an independent set of 100 FPD images. Mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) were used to quantify the similarity between synthetic and ground-truth FPD images. Computation time for generating synthetic images was also measured. Results Despite some positional mismatches in the DRR-FPD pairs, the synthetic FPD images closely resembled the ground-truth FPD images. The proposed DNN achieved notable improvements over both input DRR images and a U-Net-based method in terms of MAE, PSNR, SSIM, and KID. The average image generation time was on the order of milliseconds per image, indicating its potential for real-time application. Qualitative evaluations showed that the DNN successfully reproduced image noise patterns akin to real FPD images, reducing the need for manual noise adjustments. Conclusions The proposed DNN effectively converted DRR images into realistic FPD images for thoracic cases, offering a fast and practical method that could streamline patient setup verification and enhance overall clinical workflow. Future work should validate the model across different imaging systems and address remaining challenges in marker visualization, thereby fostering broader clinical adoption.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it is increasingly evident that image generation is political, contributing to broader social struggles over visual meaning. This sociopolitical aspect was highlighted by the March 2024 Gemini controversy, where Gemini faced criticism for inappropriately injecting demographic diversity into user prompts. Although the developers sought to redress image generation's sociopolitical dimension by introducing diversity "corrections," their opaque imposition of a standard for "diversity" ultimately proved counterproductive. In this paper, we present an alternative approach: an image generation interface designed to embrace open negotiation along the sociopolitical dimensions of image creation. Grounded in the principles of agonistic pluralism (from the Greek agon, meaning struggle), our interface actively engages users with competing visual interpretations of their prompts. Through a lab study with 29 participants, we evaluate our agonistic interface on its ability to facilitate reflection - engagement with other perspectives and challenging dominant assumptions - a core principle that underpins agonistic contestation. We compare it to three existing paradigms: a standard interface, a Gemini-style interface that produces "diverse" images, and an intention-centric interface suggesting prompt refinements. Our findings demonstrate that the agonistic interface enhances reflection across multiple measures, but also that reflection depends on users perceiving the interface as both appropriate and empowering; introducing diversity without grounding it in relevant political contexts was perceived as inauthentic. Our results suggest that diversity and user intention should not be treated as opposing values to be balanced.</p></details> |  | None |

This enhances the alignment of our model with the objects in the input image without using external supervision. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in object discovery and image generation tasks across multiple datasets, including those with real images.

However, when tasked with multi-concept generation creating images that contain multiple characters or objects, existing methods often suffer from semantic entanglement, including concept entanglement and improper attribute binding, leading to significant text-image inconsistency. We identify that semantic entanglement arises when certain regions of the latent features attend to incorrect concept and attribute tokens. In this work, we propose the Semantic Protection Diffusion Model (SPDiffusion) to address both concept entanglement and improper attribute binding using only a text prompt as input. The SPDiffusion framework introduces a novel concept region extraction method SP-Extraction to resolve region entanglement in cross-attention, along with SP-Attn, which protects concept regions from the influence of irrelevant attributes and concepts. To evaluate our method, we test it on existing benchmarks, where SPDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692v4)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion-model to address the specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

However, their success depends on large, high-quality datasets that are challenging to obtain due to privacy concerns and costly annotation. Generative models, such as diffusion models, offer a potential solution by synthesizing medical images, but their practical adoption is hindered by long inference times. In this paper, we propose the use of an optimal transport flow matching approach to accelerate image generation. By introducing a straighter mapping between the source and target distribution, our method significantly reduces inference time while preserving and further enhancing the quality of the outputs. Furthermore, this approach is highly adaptable, supporting various medical imaging modalities, conditioning mechanisms (such as class labels and masks), and different spatial dimensions, including 2D and 3D. Beyond image generation, it can also be applied to related tasks such as image enhancement. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of this framework, making it a promising advancement for medical imaging applications.

Addressing these challenges requires architectures robust to the unique complexities posed by medical imaging data. The rapid advancements in vision-language foundation models within the natural image domain prompt the question of how they can be adapted for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we present PRISM, a framework that leverages foundation models to generate high-resolution, language-guided medical image counterfactuals using Stable Diffusion. Our approach demonstrates unprecedented precision in selectively modifying spurious correlations (the medical devices) and disease features, enabling the removal and addition of specific attributes while preserving other image characteristics.

We challenge this established paradigm by demonstrating that strategic data augmentation of small, well-curated datasets can match or outperform models trained on massive web-scraped collections. Using only ImageNet enhanced with well-designed text and image augmentations, we achieve a +2 overall score over SD-XL on GenEval and +5 on DPGBench while using just 1/10th the parameters and 1/1000th the training images. Our results suggest that strategic data augmentation, rather than massive datasets, could offer a more sustainable path forward for T2I generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the current AI painting ecosystem predominantly relies on text-driven diffusion models (T2I), which pose challenges in accurately capturing user requirements. Furthermore, achieving compatibility with other modalities incurs substantial training costs. To this end, we introduce DiffBrush, which is compatible with T2I models and allows users to draw and edit images. By manipulating and adapting the internal representation of the diffusion model, DiffBrush guides the model-generated images to converge towards the user's hand-drawn sketches for user's specific needs without additional training. DiffBrush achieves control over the color, semantic, and instance of objects in images by continuously guiding the latent and instance-level attention map during the denoising process of the diffusion model. Besides, we propose a latent regeneration, which refines the randomly sampled noise in the diffusion model, obtaining a better image generation layout. Finally, users only need to roughly draw the mask of the instance (acceptable colors) on the canvas, DiffBrush can naturally generate the corresponding instance at the corresponding location.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[New Dataset and Methods for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension via Specialist-MLLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20104v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. To advance this field, we introduce a new REC dataset with two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject non-existent targets, an often-overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. To address fine-grained compositional REC, we propose novel methods based on a Specialist-MLLM collaboration framework, leveraging the complementary strengths of them: Specialist Models handle simpler tasks efficiently, while MLLMs are better suited for complex reasoning. Based on this synergy, we introduce two collaborative strategies. The first, Slow-Fast Adaptation (SFA), employs a routing mechanism to adaptively delegate simple tasks to Specialist Models and complex tasks to MLLMs. Additionally, common error patterns in both models are mitigated through a target-refocus strategy. The second, Candidate Region Selection (CRS), generates multiple bounding box candidates based on Specialist Model and uses the advanced reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to identify the correct target. Extensive experiments on our dataset and other challenging compositional benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The SFA strategy achieves a trade-off between localization accuracy and efficiency, and the CRS strategy greatly boosts the performance of both Specialist Models and MLLMs. We aim for this work to offer valuable insights into solving complex real-world tasks by strategically combining existing tools for maximum effectiveness, rather than reinventing them.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Preconditioned Score-based Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06504v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models. However, a fundamental limitation is that their sampling process is slow due to a need for many (e.g., 2000) iterations of sequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the sampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We assault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and reverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a novel preconditioned diffusion sampling (PDS) method that leverages matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS alters the sampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation cost and without model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves the output distribution of the SGM, with no risk of inducing systematical bias to the original sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation between the parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations, easing the parameter estimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various image datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our PDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the synthesis quality. In particular, PDS can accelerate by up to 28x on more challenging high-resolution (1024x1024) image generation. Compared with the latest generative models (e.g., CLD-SGM and Analytic-DDIM), PDS can achieve the best sampling quality on CIFAR-10 at an FID score of 1.99.

These models can serve as strong priors for image restoration. Existing methods often utilize techniques like ControlNet to sample high quality images with low quality images from these priors. However, ControlNet typically involves copying a large part of the original network, resulting in a significantly large number of parameters as the prior scales up. In this paper, we propose a relatively lightweight Adapter that leverages the powerful generative capabilities of pretrained priors to achieve photo-realistic image restoration. The Adapters can be adapt to both denoising UNet and DiT, and performs excellent.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</p></details> |  | None |

However, according to current research, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to control the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such as a specific patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well equipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger inversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input spaces and triggers defined by low-dimensional features. To bridge these gaps, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables attackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through hidden style triggers within input images. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the first time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image2image tasks by utilizing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term-Timesteps-Retention (STTR) of DMs. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method can easily bypass existing defense methods. Among existing DM main backdoor defense frameworks, our approach achieves a 0\% backdoor detection rate (BDR).

Alignment methods aim to modify these models to ensure they generate only non-harmful images, even when exposed to unsafe prompts. A typical text-to-image model comprises two main components: 1) a text encoder and 2) a diffusion module. Existing alignment methods mainly focus on modifying the diffusion module to prevent harmful image generation. However, this often significantly impacts the model's behavior for safe prompts, causing substantial quality degradation of generated images. In this work, we propose SafeText, a novel alignment method that fine-tunes the text encoder rather than the diffusion module. By adjusting the text encoder, SafeText significantly alters the embedding vectors for unsafe prompts, while minimally affecting those for safe prompts. As a result, the diffusion module generates non-harmful images for unsafe prompts while preserving the quality of images for safe prompts. We evaluate SafeText on multiple datasets of safe and unsafe prompts, including those generated through jailbreak attacks. Our results show that SafeText effectively prevents harmful image generation with minor impact on the images for safe prompts, and SafeText outperforms six existing alignment methods. We will publish our code and data after paper acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

FlexVAR facilitates autoregressive learning with ground-truth prediction, enabling each step to independently produce plausible images. This simple, intuitive approach swiftly learns visual distributions and makes the generation process more flexible and adaptable. Trained solely on low-resolution images ($\leq$ 256px), FlexVAR can: (1) Generate images of various resolutions and aspect ratios, even exceeding the resolution of the training images. (2) Support various image-to-image tasks, including image refinement, in/out-painting, and image expansion. (3) Adapt to various autoregressive steps, allowing for faster inference with fewer steps or enhancing image quality with more steps. Our 1.0B model outperforms its VAR counterpart on the ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark. Moreover, when zero-shot transfer the image generation process with 13 steps, the performance further improves to 2.08 FID, outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive models AiM/VAR by 0.25/0.28 FID and popular diffusion models LDM/DiT by 1.52/0.19 FID, respectively. When transferring our 1.0B model to the ImageNet 512$\times$512 benchmark in a zero-shot manner, FlexVAR achieves competitive results compared to the VAR 2.3B model, which is a fully supervised model trained at 512$\times$512 resolution.</p></details> |  | None |

Although there have been efforts to control output images with additional conditions, like canny and depth map, a comprehensive framework for arbitrary text-image interleaved control is still lacking. This gap is especially evident when attempting to merge concepts or visual elements from multiple images in the generation process. To mitigate the gap, we conducted preliminary experiments showing that large multimodal models (LMMs) offer an effective shared representation space, where image and text can be well-aligned to serve as a condition for external diffusion models. Based on this discovery, we propose Dream Engine, an efficient and unified framework designed for arbitrary text-image interleaved control in image generation models. Building on powerful text-to-image models like SD3.5, we replace the original text-only encoders by incorporating versatile multimodal information encoders such as QwenVL. Our approach utilizes a two-stage training paradigm, consisting of joint text-image alignment and multimodal interleaved instruction tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that this training method is effective, achieving a 0.69 overall score on the GenEval benchmark, and matching the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like SD3.5 and FLUX.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, codebase in https://github.com/chenllliang/DreamEngine</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/chenllliang/DreamEngine) |

In this work, we revisit the conventional static paradigm that allocates a fixed compute budget per denoising iteration and propose a dynamic strategy instead. Our simple and sample-efficient framework enables pre-trained DiT models to be converted into \emph{flexible} ones -- dubbed FlexiDiT -- allowing them to process inputs at varying compute budgets. We demonstrate how a single \emph{flexible} model can generate images without any drop in quality, while reducing the required FLOPs by more than $40$\% compared to their static counterparts, for both class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation. Our method is general and agnostic to input and conditioning modalities. We show how our approach can be readily extended for video generation, where FlexiDiT models generate samples with up to $75$\% less compute without compromising performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods for aligning diffusion models either require retraining or are limited to differentiable reward functions. To address these limitations, we propose a stochastic optimization approach, dubbed Demon, to guide the denoising process at inference time without backpropagation through reward functions or model retraining. Our approach works by controlling noise distribution in denoising steps to concentrate density on regions corresponding to high rewards through stochastic optimization. We provide comprehensive theoretical and empirical evidence to support and validate our approach, including experiments that use non-differentiable sources of rewards such as Visual-Language Model (VLM) APIs and human judgements. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first inference-time, backpropagation-free preference alignment method for diffusion models. Our method can be easily integrated with existing diffusion models without further training. Our experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves the average aesthetics scores for text-to-image generation.

In this paper, we observe that diffusion models struggle to accurately reconstruct mid-band frequency information in real images, suggesting the limitation could serve as a cue for detecting diffusion model generated images. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel method called Frequency-guided Reconstruction Error (FIRE), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the influence of frequency decomposition on reconstruction error. FIRE assesses the variation in reconstruction error before and after the frequency decomposition, offering a robust method for identifying diffusion model generated images. Extensive experiments show that FIRE generalizes effectively to unseen diffusion models and maintains robustness against diverse perturbations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures | None |

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of CLIP's performance limitations in multi-object contexts through controlled experiments. We introduce two custom datasets, SimCO and CompCO, to evaluate CLIP's image and text encoders in various multi-object configurations. Our findings reveal significant biases in both encoders: the image encoder favors larger objects, while the text encoder prioritizes objects mentioned first in descriptions. We hypothesize these biases originate from CLIP's training process and provide evidence through analyses of the COCO dataset and CLIP's training progression. Additionally, we extend our investigation to Stable Diffusion models, revealing that biases in the CLIP text encoder significantly impact text-to-image generation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate how these biases affect CLIP's performance in image-caption matching and generation tasks, particularly when manipulating object sizes and their order in captions.

Current methods typically perform the entire sampling process at full resolution and process all frequency components simultaneously, contradicting with the inherent coarse-to-fine nature of latent diffusion models and wasting computations on processing premature high-frequency details at early diffusion stages. To address this issue, we introduce an efficient $\textbf{Fre}$quency-aware $\textbf{Ca}$scaded $\textbf{S}$ampling framework, $\textbf{FreCaS}$ in short, for higher-resolution image generation. FreCaS decomposes the sampling process into cascaded stages with gradually increased resolutions, progressively expanding frequency bands and refining the corresponding details. We propose an innovative frequency-aware classifier-free guidance (FA-CFG) strategy to assign different guidance strengths for different frequency components, directing the diffusion model to add new details in the expanded frequency domain of each stage. Additionally, we fuse the cross-attention maps of previous and current stages to avoid synthesizing unfaithful layouts. Experiments demonstrate that FreCaS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and generation speed. In particular, FreCaS is about 2.86$\times$ and 6.07$\times$ faster than ScaleCrafter and DemoFusion in generating a 2048$\times$2048 image using a pre-trained SDXL model and achieves an FID$_b$ improvement of 11.6 and 3.7, respectively. FreCaS can be easily extended to more complex models such as SD3.

| **[MFSR: Multi-fractal Feature for Super-resolution Reconstruction with Fine Details Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19797v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the process of performing image super-resolution processing, the processing of complex localized information can have a significant impact on the quality of the image generated. Fractal features can capture the rich details of both micro and macro texture structures in an image. Therefore, we propose a diffusion model-based super-resolution method incorporating fractal features of low-resolution images, named MFSR. MFSR leverages these fractal features as reinforcement conditions in the denoising process of the diffusion model to ensure accurate recovery of texture information. MFSR employs convolution as a soft assignment to approximate the fractal features of low-resolution images. This approach is also used to approximate the density feature maps of these images. By using soft assignment, the spatial layout of the image is described hierarchically, encoding the self-similarity properties of the image at different scales. Different processing methods are applied to various types of features to enrich the information acquired by the model. In addition, a sub-denoiser is integrated in the denoising U-Net to reduce the noise in the feature maps during the up-sampling process in order to improve the quality of the generated images. Experiments conducted on various face and natural image datasets demonstrate that MFSR can generate higher quality images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[The erasure of intensive livestock farming in text-to-image generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19771v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) is increasingly integrated into people's daily lives. While it is known that AI perpetuates biases against marginalized human groups, their impact on non-human animals remains understudied. We found that ChatGPT's text-to-image model (DALL-E 3) introduces a strong bias toward romanticizing livestock farming as dairy cows on pasture and pigs rooting in mud. This bias remained when we requested realistic depictions and was only mitigated when the automatic prompt revision was inhibited. Most farmed animal in industrialized countries are reared indoors with limited space per animal, which fail to resonate with societal values. Inhibiting prompt revision resulted in images that more closely reflected modern farming practices; for example, cows housed indoors accessing feed through metal headlocks, and pigs behind metal railings on concrete floors in indoor facilities. While OpenAI introduced prompt revision to mitigate bias, in the case of farmed animal production systems, it paradoxically introduces a strong bias towards unrealistic farming practices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Nephrographic Image Synthesis in CT Urography with the Diffusion Model and Swin Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19623v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: This study aims to develop and validate a method for synthesizing 3D nephrographic phase images in CT urography (CTU) examinations using a diffusion model integrated with a Swin Transformer-based deep learning approach. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. A dataset comprising 327 patients who underwent three-phase CTU (mean $\pm$ SD age, 63 $\pm$ 15 years; 174 males, 153 females) was curated for deep learning model development. The three phases for each patient were aligned with an affine registration algorithm. A custom deep learning model coined dsSNICT (diffusion model with a Swin transformer for synthetic nephrographic phase images in CT) was developed and implemented to synthesize the nephrographic images. Performance was assessed using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Fr\'{e}chet Video Distance (FVD). Qualitative evaluation by two fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists was performed. Results: The synthetic nephrographic images generated by our proposed approach achieved high PSNR (26.3 $\pm$ 4.4 dB), SSIM (0.84 $\pm$ 0.069), MAE (12.74 $\pm$ 5.22 HU), and FVD (1323). Two radiologists provided average scores of 3.5 for real images and 3.4 for synthetic images (P-value = 0.5) on a Likert scale of 1-5, indicating that our synthetic images closely resemble real images. Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively synthesizes high-quality 3D nephrographic phase images. This model can be used to reduce radiation dose in CTU by 33.3\% without compromising image quality, which thereby enhances the safety and diagnostic utility of CT urography.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Graph-Based Captioning: Enhancing Visual Descriptions by Interconnecting Region Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06723v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans describe complex scenes with compositionality, using simple text descriptions enriched with links and relationships. While vision-language research has aimed to develop models with compositional understanding capabilities, this is not reflected yet in existing datasets which, for the most part, still use plain text to describe images. In this work, we propose a new annotation strategy, graph-based captioning (GBC) that describes an image using a labeled graph structure, with nodes of various types. The nodes in GBC are created through a two-stage process: first, identifying and describing entity nodes; second, linking these nodes by highlighting \textit{compositions} and \textit{relations} among them. Since \textit{all} GBC nodes hold plain text descriptions, GBC retains the flexibility found in natural language, but can also encode hierarchical information in its edges. We demonstrate that GBC can be produced automatically, using off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs and object detection models, by building a new dataset GBC10M that gathers GBC annotations for about 10M images of the CC12M dataset. Through CLIP training on GBC10M, we show that leveraging GBC nodes' annotations -- particularly those in composition and relation nodes -- significantly boosts the model's performance across various benchmarks compared to when other annotations are used. To further explore the opportunities provided by GBC, we also investigate the use of GBC as middleware for text-to-image generation, and show the extra benefits of incorporating the graph structure in this task. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/apple/ml-gbc and https://huggingface.co/graph-based-captions.</p></details> | 59 pages, 42 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/apple/ml-gbc) |
| **[Improved YOLOv12 with LLM-Generated Synthetic Data for Enhanced Apple Detection and Benchmarking Against YOLOv11 and YOLOv10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00057v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluated the performance of the YOLOv12 object detection model, and compared against YOLOv11 and YOLOv10 for apple detection in commercial orchards using synthetic images generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The YOLOv12n configuration excelled, achieving the highest precision at 0.916, the highest recall at 0.969, and the highest mean Average Precision (mAP@50) at 0.978. In comparison, the YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which recorded the highest precision at 0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and YOLOv10l tied for the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving the highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. The study also highlighted efficiency in processing speeds, where YOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's 5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new in more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, the YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO algorithm among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on high-quality LLM-generated datasets, not only surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics but also offered a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Simple Guidance Mechanisms for Discrete Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10193v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models for continuous data gained widespread adoption owing to their high quality generation and control mechanisms. However, controllable diffusion on discrete data faces challenges given that continuous guidance methods do not directly apply to discrete diffusion. Here, we provide a straightforward derivation of classifier-free and classifier-based guidance for discrete diffusion, as well as a new class of diffusion models that leverage uniform noise and that are more guidable because they can continuously edit their outputs. We improve the quality of these models with a novel continuous-time variational lower bound that yields state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings involving guidance or fast generation. Empirically, we demonstrate that our guidance mechanisms combined with uniform noise diffusion improve controllable generation relative to autoregressive and diffusion baselines on several discrete data domains, including genomic sequences, small molecule design, and discretized image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Code to reproduce our experiments is available here: https://github.com/kuleshov-group/discrete-diffusion-guidance</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/kuleshov-group/discrete-diffusion-guidance) |
| **[Aligned Datasets Improve Detection of Latent Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11835v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As latent diffusion models (LDMs) democratize image generation capabilities, there is a growing need to detect fake images. A good detector should focus on the generative models fingerprints while ignoring image properties such as semantic content, resolution, file format, etc. Fake image detectors are usually built in a data driven way, where a model is trained to separate real from fake images. Existing works primarily investigate network architecture choices and training recipes. In this work, we argue that in addition to these algorithmic choices, we also require a well aligned dataset of real/fake images to train a robust detector. For the family of LDMs, we propose a very simple way to achieve this: we reconstruct all the real images using the LDMs autoencoder, without any denoising operation. We then train a model to separate these real images from their reconstructions. The fakes created this way are extremely similar to the real ones in almost every aspect (e.g., size, aspect ratio, semantic content), which forces the model to look for the LDM decoders artifacts. We empirically show that this way of creating aligned real/fake datasets, which also sidesteps the computationally expensive denoising process, helps in building a detector that focuses less on spurious correlations, something that a very popular existing method is susceptible to. Finally, to demonstrate just how effective the alignment in a dataset can be, we build a detector using images that are not natural objects, and present promising results. Overall, our work identifies the subtle but significant issues that arise when training a fake image detector and proposes a simple and inexpensive solution to address these problems.</p></details> |  | None |
