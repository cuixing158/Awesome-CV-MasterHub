| **[CLIMB-3D: Continual Learning for Imbalanced 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17429v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D instance segmentation has made significant progress, current methods struggle to address realistic scenarios where new categories emerge over time with natural class imbalance. This limitation stems from existing datasets, which typically feature few well-balanced classes. Although few datasets include unbalanced class annotations, they lack the diverse incremental scenarios necessary for evaluating methods under incremental settings. Addressing these challenges requires frameworks that handle both incremental learning and class imbalance. However, existing methods for 3D incremental segmentation rely heavily on large exemplar replay, focusing only on incremental learning while neglecting class imbalance. Moreover, frequency-based tuning for balanced learning is impractical in these setups due to the lack of prior class statistics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework to tackle both \textbf{C}ontinual \textbf{L}earning and class \textbf{Imb}alance for \textbf{3D} instance segmentation (\textbf{CLIMB-3D}). Our proposed approach combines Exemplar Replay (ER), Knowledge Distillation (KD), and a novel Imbalance Correction (IC) module. Unlike prior methods, our framework minimizes ER usage, with KD preventing forgetting and supporting the IC module in compiling past class statistics to balance learning of rare classes during incremental updates. To evaluate our framework, we design three incremental scenarios based on class frequency, semantic similarity, and random grouping that aim to mirror real-world dynamics in 3D environments. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an increase of up to 16.76\% in mAP compared to the baseline.

| **[OpenVox: Real-time Instance-level Open-vocabulary Probabilistic Voxel Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16528v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced open-vocabulary mapping, enabling mobile robots to simultaneously achieve environmental reconstruction and high-level semantic understanding. While integrated object cognition helps mitigate semantic ambiguity in point-wise feature maps, efficiently obtaining rich semantic understanding and robust incremental reconstruction at the instance-level remains challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce OpenVox, a real-time incremental open-vocabulary probabilistic instance voxel representation. In the front-end, we design an efficient instance segmentation and comprehension pipeline that enhances language reasoning through encoding captions. In the back-end, we implement probabilistic instance voxels and formulate the cross-frame incremental fusion process into two subtasks: instance association and live map evolution, ensuring robustness to sensor and segmentation noise. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that OpenVox achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and open-vocabulary retrieval. Furthermore, real-world robotics experiments validate OpenVox's capability for stable, real-time operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://open-vox.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[Prompt-Driven Building Footprint Extraction in Aerial Images with Offset-Building Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16717v4)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>More accurate extraction of invisible building footprints from very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images relies on roof segmentation and roof-to-footprint offset extraction. Existing methods based on instance segmentation suffer from poor generalization when extended to large-scale data production and fail to achieve low-cost human interaction. This prompt paradigm inspires us to design a promptable framework for roof and offset extraction, and transforms end-to-end algorithms into promptable methods. Within this framework, we propose a novel Offset-Building Model (OBM). Based on prompt prediction, we first discover a common pattern of predicting offsets and tailored Distance-NMS (DNMS) algorithms for offset optimization. To rigorously evaluate the algorithm's capabilities, we introduce a prompt-based evaluation method, where our model reduces offset errors by 16.6\% and improves roof Intersection over Union (IoU) by 10.8\% compared to other models. Leveraging the common patterns in predicting offsets, DNMS algorithms enable models to further reduce offset vector loss by 6.5\%. To further validate the generalization of models, we tested them using a newly proposed test set, Huizhou test set, with over 7,000 manually annotated instance samples. Our algorithms and dataset will be available at https://github.com/likaiucas/OBM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/likaiucas/OBM) |
| **[ZeroPS: High-quality Cross-modal Knowledge Transfer for Zero-Shot 3D Part Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14262v4)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot 3D part segmentation is a challenging and fundamental task. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, ZeroPS, which achieves high-quality knowledge transfer from 2D pretrained foundation models (FMs), SAM and GLIP, to 3D object point clouds. We aim to explore the natural relationship between multi-view correspondence and the FMs' prompt mechanism and build bridges on it. In ZeroPS, the relationship manifests as follows: 1) lifting 2D to 3D by leveraging co-viewed regions and SAM's prompt mechanism, 2) relating 1D classes to 3D parts by leveraging 2D-3D view projection and GLIP's prompt mechanism, and 3) enhancing prediction performance by leveraging multi-view observations. Extensive evaluations on the PartNetE and AKBSeg benchmarks demonstrate that ZeroPS significantly outperforms the SOTA method across zero-shot unlabeled and instance segmentation tasks. ZeroPS does not require additional training or fine-tuning for the FMs. ZeroPS applies to both simulated and real-world data. It is hardly affected by domain shift.

| **[Generalized Robot 3D Vision-Language Model with Fast Rendering and Pre-Training Vision-Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00663v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural network models have achieved remarkable progress in 3D scene understanding while trained in the closed-set setting and with full labels. However, the major bottleneck is that these models do not have the capacity to recognize any unseen novel classes beyond the training categories in diverse real-world applications. Therefore, we are in urgent need of a framework that can simultaneously be applicable to both 3D point cloud segmentation and detection, particularly in the circumstances where the labels are rather scarce. This work presents a generalized and straightforward framework for dealing with 3D scene understanding when the labeled scenes are quite limited. To extract knowledge for novel categories from the pre-trained vision-language models, we propose a hierarchical feature-aligned pre-training and knowledge distillation strategy to extract and distill meaningful information from large-scale vision-language models, which helps benefit the open-vocabulary scene understanding tasks. To encourage latent instance discrimination and to guarantee efficiency, we propose the unsupervised region-level semantic contrastive learning scheme for point clouds, using confident predictions of the neural network to discriminate the intermediate feature embeddings at multiple stages. In the limited reconstruction case, our proposed approach, termed WS3D++, ranks 1st on the large-scale ScanNet benchmark on both the task of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. Extensive experiments with both indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in both data-efficient learning and open-world few-shot learning.

| **[WeedsGalore: A Multispectral and Multitemporal UAV-based Dataset for Crop and Weed Segmentation in Agricultural Maize Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13103v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weeds are one of the major reasons for crop yield loss but current weeding practices fail to manage weeds in an efficient and targeted manner. Effective weed management is especially important for crops with high worldwide production such as maize, to maximize crop yield for meeting increasing global demands. Advances in near-sensing and computer vision enable the development of new tools for weed management. Specifically, state-of-the-art segmentation models, coupled with novel sensing technologies, can facilitate timely and accurate weeding and monitoring systems. However, learning-based approaches require annotated data and show a lack of generalization to aerial imaging for different crops. We present a novel dataset for semantic and instance segmentation of crops and weeds in agricultural maize fields. The multispectral UAV-based dataset contains images with RGB, red-edge, and near-infrared bands, a large number of plant instances, dense annotations for maize and four weed classes, and is multitemporal. We provide extensive baseline results for both tasks, including probabilistic methods to quantify prediction uncertainty, improve model calibration, and demonstrate the approach's applicability to out-of-distribution data. The results show the effectiveness of the two additional bands compared to RGB only, and better performance in our target domain than models trained on existing datasets. We hope our dataset advances research on methods and operational systems for fine-grained weed identification, enhancing the robustness and applicability of UAV-based weed management.

| **[DAMamba: Vision State Space Model with Dynamic Adaptive Scan](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12627v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently garnered significant attention in computer vision. However, due to the unique characteristics of image data, adapting SSMs from natural language processing to computer vision has not outperformed the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

| **[FrGNet: A fourier-guided weakly-supervised framework for nuclear instance segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09874v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear instance segmentation has played a critical role in pathology image analysis. The main challenges arise from the difficulty in accurately segmenting instances and the high cost of precise mask-level annotations for fully-supervised training.In this work, we propose a fourier guidance framework for solving the weakly-supervised nuclear instance segmentation problem. In this framework, we construct a fourier guidance module to fuse the priori information into the training process of the model, which facilitates the model to capture the relevant features of the nuclear. Meanwhile, in order to further improve the model's ability to represent the features of nuclear, we propose the guide-based instance level contrastive module. This module makes full use of the framework's own properties and guide information to effectively enhance the representation features of nuclear. We show on two public datasets that our model can outperform current SOTA methods under fully-supervised design, and in weakly-supervised experiments, with only a small amount of labeling our model still maintains close to the performance under full supervision.In addition, we also perform generalization experiments on a private dataset, and without any labeling, our model is able to segment nuclear images that have not been seen during training quite effectively.

| **[iFormer: Integrating ConvNet and Transformer for Mobile Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15369v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new family of mobile hybrid vision networks, called iFormer, with a focus on optimizing latency and accuracy on mobile applications. iFormer effectively integrates the fast local representation capacity of convolution with the efficient global modeling ability of self-attention. The local interactions are derived from transforming a standard convolutional network, \textit{i.e.}, ConvNeXt, to design a more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4\% on ImageNet-1k with a latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[SynCo: Synthetic Hard Negatives for Contrastive Visual Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02401v7)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has become a dominant approach in self-supervised visual representation learning, but efficiently leveraging hard negatives, which are samples closely resembling the anchor, remains challenging. We introduce SynCo (Synthetic negatives in Contrastive learning), a novel approach that improves model performance by generating synthetic hard negatives on the representation space. Building on the MoCo framework, SynCo introduces six strategies for creating diverse synthetic hard negatives on-the-fly with minimal computational overhead. SynCo achieves faster training and strong representation learning, surpassing MoCo-v2 by +0.4% and MoCHI by +1.0% on ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 linear evaluation. It also transfers more effectively to detection tasks achieving strong results on PASCAL VOC detection (57.2% AP) and significantly improving over MoCo-v2 on COCO detection (+1.0% AP) and instance segmentation (+0.8% AP). Our synthetic hard negative generation approach significantly enhances visual representations learned through self-supervised contrastive learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[High-quality Unknown Object Instance Segmentation via Quadruple Boundary Error Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16132v4)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient segmentation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is essential for robotic manipulation. Unknown Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS), which aims to identify all objects in unknown categories and backgrounds, has become a key capability for various robotic tasks. However, existing methods struggle with over-segmentation and under-segmentation, leading to failures in manipulation tasks such as grasping. To address these challenges, we propose QuBER (Quadruple Boundary Error Refinement), a novel error-informed refinement approach for high-quality UOIS. QuBER first estimates quadruple boundary errors-true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative pixels-at the instance boundaries of the initial segmentation. It then refines the segmentation using an error-guided fusion mechanism, effectively correcting both fine-grained and instance-level segmentation errors. Extensive evaluations on three public benchmarks demonstrate that QuBER outperforms state-of-the-art methods and consistently improves various UOIS methods while maintaining a fast inference time of less than 0.1 seconds. Furthermore, we show that QuBER improves the success rate of grasping target objects in cluttered environments.

Traffic monitoring models must comprehensively understand dynamic urban conditions and provide an intuitive user interface for effective management. This research leverages the LLaVA visual grounding multimodal large language model (LLM) for traffic monitoring tasks on the real-time Quanser Interactive Lab simulation platform, covering scenarios like intersections, congestion, and collisions. Cameras placed at multiple urban locations collect real-time images from the simulation, which are fed into the LLaVA model with queries for analysis. An instance segmentation model integrated into the cameras highlights key elements such as vehicles and pedestrians, enhancing training and throughput. The system achieves 84.3% accuracy in recognizing vehicle locations and 76.4% in determining steering direction, outperforming traditional models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to 30th IEEE International Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Instance Segmentation of Scene Sketches Using Natural Image Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09608v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketch segmentation involves grouping pixels within a sketch that belong to the same object or instance. It serves as a valuable tool for sketch editing tasks, such as moving, scaling, or removing specific components. While image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, sketches present unique challenges for these models due to their sparse nature and wide variation in styles. We introduce SketchSeg, a method for instance segmentation of raster scene sketches. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art image segmentation and object detection models to the sketch domain by employing class-agnostic fine-tuning and refining segmentation masks using depth cues. Furthermore, our method organizes sketches into sorted layers, where occluded instances are inpainted, enabling advanced sketch editing applications. As existing datasets in this domain lack variation in sketch styles, we construct a synthetic scene sketch segmentation dataset featuring sketches with diverse brush strokes and varying levels of detail. We use this dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our approach and will release it to promote further research in the field.

| **[Heuristical Comparison of Vision Transformers Against Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09101v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently brought a new wave of research in the field of computer vision. These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT. The code for this implementation can be found at: https://github.com/ashimdahal/ViT-vs-CNN-Image-Segmentation.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ashimdahal/ViT-vs-CNN-Image-Segmentation) |
| **[Open-YOLO 3D: Towards Fast and Accurate Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02548v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation show strong promise, but at the cost of slow inference speed and high computation requirements. This high computation cost is typically due to their heavy reliance on 3D clip features, which require computationally expensive 2D foundation models like Segment Anything (SAM) and CLIP for multi-view aggregation into 3D. As a consequence, this hampers their applicability in many real-world applications that require both fast and accurate predictions. To this end, we propose a fast yet accurate open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation approach, named Open-YOLO 3D, that effectively leverages only 2D object detection from multi-view RGB images for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. We address this task by generating class-agnostic 3D masks for objects in the scene and associating them with text prompts. We observe that the projection of class-agnostic 3D point cloud instances already holds instance information; thus, using SAM might only result in redundancy that unnecessarily increases the inference time. We empirically find that a better performance of matching text prompts to 3D masks can be achieved in a faster fashion with a 2D object detector. We validate our Open-YOLO 3D on two benchmarks, ScanNet200 and Replica, under two scenarios: (i) with ground truth masks, where labels are required for given object proposals, and (ii) with class-agnostic 3D proposals generated from a 3D proposal network. Our Open-YOLO 3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while obtaining up to $\sim$16$\times$ speedup compared to the best existing method in literature. On ScanNet200 val. set, our Open-YOLO 3D achieves mean average precision (mAP) of 24.7\% while operating at 22 seconds per scene.

| **[Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06657v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

However, the creation of high-quality annotated datasets for training remains a major challenge. This study introduces a novel single-stage approach (HistoSmith) for generating image-label pairs to augment histology datasets. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with separate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a latent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts, classification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data generation by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types, quantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&E histopathology dataset and the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and diverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell instance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented cell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generalized Class Discovery in Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08149v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance segmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable of segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and unlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed distributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently imbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an instance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and class-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes instance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD. The reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail classes when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from GCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage diverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable pseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft attention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments on two settings: COCO$_{half}$ + LVIS and LVIS + Visual Genome. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[EmbodiedSAM: Online Segment Any 3D Thing in Real Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11811v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting.

| **[Robot Instance Segmentation with Few Annotations for Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01302v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of robots to manipulate objects relies heavily on their aptitude for visual perception. In domains characterized by cluttered scenes and high object variability, most methods call for vast labeled datasets, laboriously hand-annotated, with the aim of training capable models. Once deployed, the challenge of generalizing to unfamiliar objects implies that the model must evolve alongside its domain. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Learning Through Interaction (LTI), allowing a model to learn by observing scene alterations and leverage visual consistency despite temporal gaps without requiring curated data of interaction sequences. As a result, our approach exploits partially annotated data through self-supervision and incorporates temporal context using pseudo-sequences generated from unlabeled still images. We validate our method on two common benchmarks, ARMBench mix-object-tote and OCID, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on ARMBench, we attain an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of $86.37$, almost a $20\%$ improvement over existing work, and obtain remarkable results in scenarios with extremely low annotation, achieving an $\text{AP}_{50}$ score of $84.89$ with just $1 \%$ of annotated data compared to $72$ presented in ARMBench on the fully annotated counterpart.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video synthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX generation as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from user-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images. Our work makes two primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video dataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual descriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and start-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet effective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion Transformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA adapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask control module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized start-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the text encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace. Extensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and temporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to evaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX techniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX accessible to a broader audience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vfx-creator0.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Current datasets for training and evaluating these methods are limited in scale and diversity. To address this, we propose a methodology for creating high-quality inpainting datasets and apply it to create DiQuID, comprising over 95,000 inpainted images generated from 78,000 original images sourced from MS-COCO, RAISE, and OpenImages. Our methodology consists of three components: (1) Semantically Aligned Object Replacement (SAOR) that identifies suitable objects through instance segmentation and generates contextually appropriate prompts, (2) Multiple Model Image Inpainting (MMII) that employs various state-of-the-art inpainting pipelines primarily based on diffusion models to create diverse manipulations, and (3) Uncertainty-Guided Deceptiveness Assessment (UGDA) that evaluates image realism through comparative analysis with originals. The resulting dataset surpasses existing ones in diversity, aesthetic quality, and technical quality. We provide comprehensive benchmarking results using state-of-the-art forgery detection methods, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in evaluating and improving detection algorithms. Through a human study with 42 participants on 1,000 images, we show that while humans struggle with images classified as deceiving by our methodology, models trained on our dataset maintain high performance on these challenging cases.

In this work, we propose a new deep learning framework, CISCA, for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices. At the core of CISCA is a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately produces the segmentation of individual cells. The third head enables the simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H&Estained datasets that cover diverse tissue types and magnifications. In addition, we introduce CytoDArk0, the first annotated dataset of Nissl-stained histological images of the mammalian brain, containing nearly 40k annotated neurons and glia cells, aimed at facilitating advancements in digital neuropathology and brain cytoarchitecture studies. We evaluate CISCA against other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its versatility, robustness, and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques. This makes CISCA well-suited for detailed analyses of cell morphology and efficient cell counting in both digital pathology workflows and brain cytoarchitecture research.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  | None |

Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines, reduced manual selection of geometric properties, and superior performance. However, transformer-based methods fail to simultaneously maintain strong position and content information during query initialization. Additionally, due to supervision at each decoder layer, there exists a phenomenon of object disappearance with the deepening of layers. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Beyond the Final Layer: Hierarchical Query Fusion Transformer with Agent-Interpolation Initialization for 3D Instance Segmentation (BFL). Specifically, an Agent-Interpolation Initialization Module is designed to generate resilient queries capable of achieving a balance between foreground coverage and content learning. Additionally, a Hierarchical Query Fusion Decoder is designed to retain low overlap queries, mitigating the decrease in recall with the deepening of layers. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++ and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BFL.</p></details> | Under review | None |

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix</p></details> | None |

Traditional supervised learningbased segmentation techniques require extensive annotated datasets, which are impractical for the diversity of objects encountered in real-world scenarios. Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS) methods aim to address this by training models on synthetic data to generalize to novel objects, but they often suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap. This paper proposes a novel approach (ZISVFM) for solving UOIS by leveraging the powerful zero-shot capability of the segment anything model (SAM) and explicit visual representations from a selfsupervised vision transformer (ViT). The proposed framework operates in three stages: (1) generating object-agnostic mask proposals from colorized depth images using SAM, (2) refining these proposals using attention-based features from the selfsupervised ViT to filter non-object masks, and (3) applying K-Medoids clustering to generate point prompts that guide SAM towards precise object segmentation. Experimental validation on two benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrates the superior performance of ZISVFM in complex environments, including hierarchical settings such as cabinets, drawers, and handheld objects.

Our method addresses three critical requirements for effective training: precise 3D region segmentation, comprehensive textual descriptions, and sufficient dataset scale. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation models and region-aware Vision-Language Models, we develop an automatic pipeline that generates high-quality 3D mask-text pairs. Applying this pipeline to multiple 3D scene datasets, we create Mosaic3D-5.6M, a dataset of over 30K annotated scenes with 5.6M mask-text pairs, significantly larger than existing datasets.

However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed RGB-D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D instances by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating SAM prompts in 3D to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring the view consistency of SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest selecting prompts from the initial set guided by the information of SAM-predicted masks across all views, which enhances the overall performance. We further propose to consolidate different prompts if they are segmenting different surface parts of the same 3D instance, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does not require any additional training. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable or better performance compared to previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases surpasses human annotations. Furthermore, since our fine-grained predictions often lack annotations in available datasets, we present ScanNet200-Fine50 test data which provides fine-grained annotations on 50 scenes from ScanNet200 dataset.

In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate that META exhibits superior generalization capability and stronger adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation.

Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

Current methods leverage the generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer instance-specific prompts from these task-generic prompts in order to guide the segmentation process. However, when VLMs struggle to generalise to some image instances, predicting instance-specific prompts becomes poor. To solve this problem, we introduce \textbf{I}nstance-specific \textbf{N}egative Mining for \textbf{T}ask-Generic Promptable Segmentation (\textbf{INT}). The key idea of INT is to adaptively reduce the influence of irrelevant (negative) prior knowledge whilst to increase the use the most plausible prior knowledge, selected by negative mining with higher contrast, in order to optimise instance-specific prompts generation. Specifically, INT consists of two components: (1) instance-specific prompt generation, which progressively fliters out incorrect information in prompt generation; (2) semantic mask generation, which ensures each image instance segmentation matches correctly the semantics of the instance-specific prompts. INT is validated on six datasets, including camouflaged objects and medical images, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>A new...</summary><p>A new task-generic promptable segmentation approach</p></details> | None |

However, a performance gap persists between foundation models and task-specific, specialized models. Fine-tuning foundation models on downstream datasets is often necessary to bridge this gap. Unfortunately, obtaining fully annotated ground truth for downstream datasets is both challenging and costly. To address this limitation, we propose a novel test-time training paradigm that enhances the performance of foundation models on downstream datasets without requiring full annotations. Specifically, our method employs simple point prompts to guide a test-time semi-self-supervised training task. The model learns by resolving the ambiguity of the point prompt through various augmentations. This approach directly tackles challenges in the medical imaging field, where acquiring annotations is both time-intensive and expensive.

The method is fully based on the DETR paradigm and achieves end-to-end inference through iterative and progressive mechanisms to optimize contours. To improve efficiency and accuracy, we develop two novel techniques: sub-contour decoupling mechanisms and contour fine-grained distribution refinement. In the sub-contour decoupling mechanism, we propose a deformable attention-based module that adaptively selects sampling regions based on the current predicted contour, enabling more effective capturing of object boundary information. Additionally, we design a multi-stage optimization process to enhance segmentation precision by progressively refining sub-contours. The contour fine-grained distribution refinement technique aims to further improve the ability to express fine details of contours. These innovations enable Contourformer to achieve stable and precise segmentation for each instance while maintaining real-time performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Contourformer on multiple benchmark datasets, including SBD, COCO, and KINS. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and inference speed.

Accurate segmentation of each leaf is crucial for plant-related applications such as the fine-grained monitoring of plant growth and crop yield estimation. This task is challenging because of the high similarity (in shape and colour), great size variation, and heavy occlusions among leaf instances. Furthermore, the typically small size of annotated leaf datasets makes it more difficult to learn the distinctive features needed for precise segmentation. We hypothesise that the key to overcoming the these challenges lies in the specific spatial patterns of leaf distribution. In this paper, we propose the Guided Mask Transformer (GMT), which leverages and integrates leaf spatial distribution priors into a Transformer-based segmentor. These spatial priors are embedded in a set of guide functions that map leaves at different positions into a more separable embedding space.

Existing methods for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation primarily focus on identifying object-level instances but struggle with finer-grained scene entities such as object parts, or regions described by generic attributes. In this work, we introduce Search3D, an approach to construct hierarchical open-vocabulary 3D scene representations, enabling 3D search at multiple levels of granularity: fine-grained object parts, entire objects, or regions described by attributes like materials. Unlike prior methods, Search3D shifts towards a more flexible open-vocabulary 3D search paradigm, moving beyond explicit object-centric queries. For systematic evaluation, we further contribute a scene-scale open-vocabulary 3D part segmentation benchmark based on MultiScan, along with a set of open-vocabulary fine-grained part annotations on ScanNet++. Search3D outperforms baselines in scene-scale open-vocabulary 3D part segmentation, while maintaining strong performance in segmenting 3D objects and materials.

| **[Foreign object segmentation in chest x-rays through anatomy-guided shape insertion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12022v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the challenge of instance segmentation for foreign objects in chest radiographs, commonly seen in postoperative follow-ups with stents, pacemakers, or ingested objects in children. The diversity of foreign objects complicates dense annotation, as shown in insufficient existing datasets. To address this, we propose the simple generation of synthetic data through (1) insertion of arbitrary shapes (lines, polygons, ellipses) with varying contrasts and opacities, and (2) cut-paste augmentations from a small set of semi-automatically extracted labels. These insertions are guided by anatomy labels to ensure realistic placements, such as stents appearing only in relevant vessels. Our approach enables networks to segment complex structures with minimal manually labeled data. Notably, it achieves performance comparable to fully supervised models while using 93\% fewer manual annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods usually accept as input a RGB 2D image. On the other side, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors with many layers provide images that are similar to those obtained from a traditional low resolution RGB camera. Following this principle, a new dataset for segmenting cars in pseudo-RGB images has been generated. This dataset combines the information given by the LiDAR sensor into a Spherical Range Image (SRI), concretely the reflectivity, near infrared and signal intensity 2D images. These images are then fed into instance segmentation NNs. These NNs segment the cars that appear in these images, having as result a Bounding Box (BB) and mask precision of 88% and 81.5% respectively with You Only Look Once (YOLO)-v8 large. By using this segmentation NN, some trackers have been applied so as to follow each car segmented instance along a video feed, having great performance in real world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of the work accepted at 5th International Conference on Robotics, Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems (ROBOVIS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods for detecting damages like cracks and spalls are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this study explores advanced data-driven techniques using deep learning for automated damage detection and analysis. Two state-of-the-art instance segmentation models, YOLO-v7 instance segmentation and Mask R-CNN, were evaluated using a dataset comprising 400 images, augmented to 10,995 images through geometric and color-based transformations to enhance robustness. The models were trained and validated using a dataset split into 90% training set, validation and test set 10%. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP@0.5), and frames per second (FPS) were used for evaluation. YOLO-v7 achieved a superior mAP@0.5 of 96.1% and processed 40 FPS, outperforming Mask R-CNN, which achieved a mAP@0.5 of 92.1% with a slower processing speed of 18 FPS. The findings recommend YOLO-v7 instance segmentation model for real-time, high-speed structural health monitoring, while Mask R-CNN is better suited for detailed offline assessments. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to revolutionize infrastructure maintenance, offering a scalable and efficient solution for automated damage detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

In the context of oysters, meat quality assessment is paramount, focusing on shell, meat, gonad, and muscle components. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and subjective, prompting the adoption of machine vision technology for efficient and objective evaluation. We explore machine vision's capacity for segmenting oyster components, leading to the development of a multi-network ensemble approach with a global-local hierarchical attention mechanism. This approach integrates predictions from diverse models and addresses challenges posed by varying scales, ensuring robust instance segmentation across components. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance using different real-world datasets, highlighting its efficacy and robustness in enhancing oyster phenotype segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ClusterViG: Efficient Globally Aware Vision GNNs via Image Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10640v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT) have dominated the field of Computer Vision (CV). Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.91+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.

| **[SmartEraser: Remove Anything from Images using Masked-Region Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08279v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object removal has so far been dominated by the mask-and-inpaint paradigm, where the masked region is excluded from the input, leaving models relying on unmasked areas to inpaint the missing region. However, this approach lacks contextual information for the masked area, often resulting in unstable performance. In this work, we introduce SmartEraser, built with a new removing paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance. This paradigm retains the masked region in the input, using it as guidance for the removal process. It offers several distinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the object to be removed, preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the user mask often extends beyond the object itself, it aids in preserving the surrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm, we present Syn4Removal, a large-scale object removal dataset, where instance segmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removal targets, with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in object removal, especially in complex scenes with intricate compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project at: https://longtaojiang.github.io/smarteraser.github.io/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://longtaojiang.github.io/smarteraser.github.io) |

However, forestry operations such as harvesting, handling and measuring logs still require substantial human labor in remote environments posing significant safety risks. Progressively automating these tasks has the potential of increasing their efficiency as well as safety, but requires an accurate detection of individual logs as well as live trees and their context. Although initial approaches have been proposed for this challenging application domain, specialized data and algorithms are still too scarce to develop robust solutions. To mitigate this gap, we introduce the TimberVision dataset, consisting of more than 2k annotated RGB images containing a total of 51k trunk components including cut and lateral surfaces, thereby surpassing any existing dataset in this domain in terms of both quantity and detail by a large margin. Based on this data, we conduct a series of ablation experiments for oriented object detection and instance segmentation and evaluate the influence of multiple scene parameters on model performance. We introduce a generic framework to fuse the components detected by our models for both tasks into unified trunk representations. Furthermore, we automatically derive geometric properties and apply multi-object tracking to further enhance robustness. Our detection and tracking approach provides highly descriptive and accurate trunk representations solely from RGB image data, even under challenging environmental conditions. Our solution is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios and can be readily combined with other sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025.

| **[Toward Realistic Camouflaged Object Detection: Benchmarks and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07297v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily relies on semantic or instance segmentation methods. While these methods have made significant advancements in identifying the contours of camouflaged objects, they may be inefficient or cost-effective for tasks that only require the specific location of the object. Object detection algorithms offer an optimized solution for Realistic Camouflaged Object Detection (RCOD) in such cases. However, detecting camouflaged objects remains a formidable challenge due to the high degree of similarity between the features of the objects and their backgrounds. Unlike segmentation methods that perform pixel-wise comparisons to differentiate between foreground and background, object detectors omit this analysis, further aggravating the challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a camouflage-aware feature refinement (CAFR) strategy. Since camouflaged objects are not rare categories, CAFR fully utilizes a clear perception of the current object within the prior knowledge of large models to assist detectors in deeply understanding the distinctions between background and foreground. Specifically, in CAFR, we introduce the Adaptive Gradient Propagation (AGP) module that fine-tunes all feature extractor layers in large detection models to fully refine class-specific features from camouflaged contexts. We then design the Sparse Feature Refinement (SFR) module that optimizes the transformer-based feature extractor to focus primarily on capturing class-specific features in camouflaged scenarios. To facilitate the assessment of RCOD tasks, we manually annotate the labels required for detection on three existing segmentation COD datasets, creating a new benchmark for RCOD tasks.

| **[Static Segmentation by Tracking: A Frustratingly Label-Efficient Approach to Fine-Grained Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06749v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study image segmentation in the biological domain, particularly trait and part segmentation from specimen images (e.g., butterfly wing stripes or beetle body parts). This is a crucial, fine-grained task that aids in understanding the biology of organisms. The conventional approach involves hand-labeling masks, often for hundreds of images per species, and training a segmentation model to generalize these labels to other images, which can be exceedingly laborious. We present a label-efficient method named Static Segmentation by Tracking (SST). SST is built upon the insight: while specimens of the same species have inherent variations, the traits and parts we aim to segment show up consistently. This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a ``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait and part segmentation as a tracking problem. Concretely, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated or predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Powered by Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM~2) initially developed for video segmentation, we show that SST can achieve high-quality trait and part segmentation with merely one labeled image per species -- a breakthrough for analyzing specimen images. We further develop a cycle-consistent loss to fine-tune the model, again using one labeled image. Additionally, we highlight the broader potential of SST, including one-shot instance segmentation on images taken in the wild and trait-based image retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

On Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, tracking seasonal trends and weather patterns of clouds provides crucial insights into one of the most complex climates in the Solar System, yet much of the available image data are still analyzed in a conventional way. In this work, we apply a Mask R-CNN trained via transfer learning to perform instance segmentation of clouds in Titan images acquired by the Cassini spacecraft - a previously unexplored approach to a big data problem in planetary science. We demonstrate that an automated technique can provide quantitative measures for clouds, such as areas and centroids, that may otherwise be prohibitively time-intensive to produce by human mapping. Furthermore, despite Titan specific challenges, our approach yields accuracy comparable to contemporary cloud identification studies on Earth and other worlds. We compare the efficiencies of human-driven versus algorithmic approaches, showing that transfer learning provides speed-ups that may open new horizons for data investigation for Titan. Moreover, we suggest that such approaches have broad potential for application to similar problems in planetary science where they are currently under-utilized. Future planned missions to the planets and remote sensing initiatives for the Earth promise to provide a deluge of image data in the coming years that will benefit strongly from leveraging machine learning approaches to perform the analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Comics Understanding, a complex and multifaceted field, stands to greatly benefit from these advances. Comics, as a medium, combine rich visual and textual narratives, challenging AI models with tasks that span image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and deeper narrative comprehension through sequential panels. However, the unique structure of comics -- characterized by creative variations in style, reading order, and non-linear storytelling -- presents a set of challenges distinct from those in other visual-language domains. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of Comics Understanding from both dataset and task perspectives. Our contributions are fivefold: (1) We analyze the structure of the comics medium, detailing its distinctive compositional elements; (2) We survey the widely used datasets and tasks in comics research, emphasizing their role in advancing the field; (3) We introduce the Layer of Comics Understanding (LoCU) framework, a novel taxonomy that redefines vision-language tasks within comics and lays the foundation for future work; (4) We provide a detailed review and categorization of existing methods following the LoCU framework; (5) Finally, we highlight current research challenges and propose directions for future exploration, particularly in the context of vision-language models applied to comics. This survey is the first to propose a task-oriented framework for comics intelligence and aims to guide future research by addressing critical gaps in data availability and task definition.

To maintain temporal consistency, large-size instances detected in the current frame are compared and associated with instances within a temporal window that includes the current and preceding frames. However, their reliance on short-term instance detection, lack of motion estimation, and exclusion of small-sized instances lead to frequent identity switches and reduced tracking performance. We address these issues with the NextStop1 tracker, which integrates Kalman filter-based motion estimation, data association, and lifespan management, along with a tracklet state concept to improve prioritization. Evaluated using the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric on the SemanticKITTI validation set, NextStop demonstrated enhanced tracking performance, particularly for small-sized objects like people and bicyclists, with fewer ID switches, earlier tracking initiation, and improved reliability in complex environments.

The data was collected in a controlled environment using an RGB camera. The annotation procedure involved manual point annotations, initial segmentation masks proposed by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), and subsequent manual correction of the masks.

The main bottleneck in connectomics pipelines is correcting topological errors, as multiple entangled neuronal arbors is a challenging instance segmentation problem. More broadly, segmentation of curvilinear, filamentous structures continues to pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we extend the notion of simple points from digital topology to connected sets of voxels (i.e. supervoxels) and propose a topology-aware neural network segmentation method with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a new public dataset of 3-d light microscopy images of mouse brains, along with the benchmark datasets DRIVE, ISBI12, and CrackTree.</p></details> |  | None |

To consider single trees, a forest point cloud needs to be segmented into individual tree point clouds. Existing segmentation methods are usually based on hand-crafted algorithms, such as identifying trunks and growing trees from them, and face difficulties in dense forests with overlapping tree crowns. In this study, we propose TreeLearn, a deep learning-based approach for tree instance segmentation of forest point clouds. TreeLearn is trained on already segmented point clouds in a data-driven manner, making it less reliant on predefined features and algorithms. Furthermore, TreeLearn is implemented as a fully automatic pipeline and does not rely on extensive hyperparameter tuning, which makes it easy to use. Additionally, we introduce a new manually segmented benchmark forest dataset containing 156 full trees. The data is generated by mobile laser scanning and contributes to create a larger and more diverse data basis for model development and fine-grained instance segmentation evaluation. We trained TreeLearn on forest point clouds of 6665 trees, labeled using the Lidar360 software. An evaluation on the benchmark dataset shows that TreeLearn performs as well as the algorithm used to generate its training data. Furthermore, the performance can be vastly improved by fine-tuning the model using manually annotated datasets. We evaluate TreeLearn on our benchmark dataset and the Wytham Woods dataset, outperforming the recent SegmentAnyTree, ForAINet and TLS2Trees methods. The TreeLearn code and all datasets that were created in the course of this work are made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few have been proposed for instance segmentation in vision-based autonomous driving. Moreover, existing methods rely on suboptimal baselines, which severely limits performance. We introduce \textbf{UDA4Inst}, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through \textit{Semantic Category Training} and \textit{Bidirectional Mixing Training}. With the Semantic Category Training method, semantically related classes are grouped and trained separately, enabling the generation of higher-quality pseudo-labels and improved segmentation performance. We further propose a bidirectional cross-domain data mixing strategy that combines instance-wise and patch-wise mixing techniques to effectively utilize data from both source and target domains, producing realistic composite images that improve the model's generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes benchmark with mAP 31.3. Notably, we are the first to report results on multiple novel synth-to-real instance segmentation datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as source domains while Cityscapes and KITTI360 serve as target domains.

Binary-weight Neural Networks (BNNs), in which weights are binarized and activations are quantized, are employed to reduce computational costs of various kinds of applications. In this paper, a design methodology of hardware architecture for inference engines is proposed to handle modern BNNs with two operation modes. Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations can be simplified by replacing multiply operations with bitwise operations. The proposed method can effectively reduce the gate count of inference engines by removing a part of computational costs from the hardware system. The architecture of MAC operations can calculate the inference results of BNNs efficiently with only 52% of hardware costs compared with the related works. To show that the inference engine can handle practical applications, two lightweight networks which combine the backbones of SegNeXt and the decoder of SparseInst for instance segmentation are also proposed. The output results of the lightweight networks are computed using only bitwise operations and add operations. The proposed inference engine has lower hardware costs than related works. The experimental results show that the proposed inference engine can handle the proposed instance-segmentation networks and achieves higher accuracy than YOLACT on the "Person" category although the model size is 77.7$\times$ smaller compared with YOLACT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for CVPR 2024 workshop (Embedded Vision Workshop)</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, creating such a representation poses challenges due to sensor noise, instance segmentation and tracking errors, and the objects' dynamic motion. This paper introduces a novel particle-based instance-aware semantic occupancy map to tackle these challenges. Particles with an augmented instance state are used to estimate the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) of the objects and implicitly model the environment. Utilizing a State-augmented Sequential Monte Carlo PHD (S$^2$MC-PHD) filter, these particles are updated to jointly estimate occupancy status, semantic, and instance IDs, mitigating noise. Additionally, a memory module is adopted to enhance the map's responsiveness to previously observed objects. Experimental results on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics under different noise conditions. Subsequent tests using real-world data further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, RGB-D segmentation-leveraging both visual and depth cues-has attracted increasing attention as it promises richer scene understanding than RGB-only methods. However, most existing efforts have primarily focused on semantic segmentation and thus leave a critical gap. There is a relative scarcity of instance-level RGB-D segmentation datasets, which restricts current methods to broad category distinctions rather than fully capturing the fine-grained details required for recognizing individual objects. To bridge this gap, we introduce three RGB-D instance segmentation benchmarks, distinguished at the instance level. These datasets are versatile, supporting a wide range of applications from indoor navigation to robotic manipulation. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of various baseline models on these benchmarks. This comprehensive analysis identifies both their strengths and shortcomings, guiding future work toward more robust, generalizable solutions. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective method for RGB-D data integration. Extensive evaluations affirm the effectiveness of our approach, offering a robust framework for advancing toward more nuanced scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

These methods predict instance masks via instance queries, ranking them by classification confidence and IoU scores to select the top prediction as the final outcome. However, it has been observed that the current models employ a fixed and higher number of queries than the instances present within a scene. In such instances, multiple queries predict the same instance, yet only a single query is ultimately optimized. The close scores of queries in the lower-level decoders make it challenging for the dominant query to distinguish itself rapidly, which ultimately impairs the model's accuracy and convergence efficiency. This phenomenon is referred to as inter-query competition. To address this challenge, we put forth a series of plug-and-play competition-oriented designs, collectively designated as the CompetitorFormer, with the aim of reducing competition and facilitating a dominant query. Experiments showed that integrating our designs with state-of-the-art frameworks consistently resulted in significant performance improvements in 3D instance segmentation across a range of datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution to address this challenging task. Our proposed method implements weighted non-local blocks (wNLB) in the feature extractor. This integration enables an inherent denoising process at the feature level. As a result, our method eliminates the need for aligned ground truth images during training, thus supporting training on real-world low-light datasets. We introduce additional learnable weights at each layer in order to enhance the network's adaptability to real-world noise characteristics, which affect different feature scales in different ways. Experimental results on several object detectors show that the proposed method outperforms the pretrained networks with an Average Precision (AP) improvement of at least +7.6, with the introduction of wNLB further enhancing AP by upto +1.3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Leverage Cross-Attention for End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01119v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary panoptic reconstruction offers comprehensive scene understanding, enabling advances in embodied robotics and photorealistic simulation. In this paper, we propose PanopticRecon++, an end-to-end method that formulates panoptic reconstruction through a novel cross-attention perspective. This perspective models the relationship between 3D instances (as queries) and the scene's 3D embedding field (as keys) through their attention map. Unlike existing methods that separate the optimization of queries and keys or overlook spatial proximity, PanopticRecon++ introduces learnable 3D Gaussians as instance queries. This formulation injects 3D spatial priors to preserve proximity while maintaining end-to-end optimizability. Moreover, this query formulation facilitates the alignment of 2D open-vocabulary instance IDs across frames by leveraging optimal linear assignment with instance masks rendered from the queries. Additionally, we ensure semantic-instance segmentation consistency by fusing query-based instance segmentation probabilities with semantic probabilities in a novel panoptic head supervised by a panoptic loss. During training, the number of instance query tokens dynamically adapts to match the number of objects. PanopticRecon++ shows competitive performance in terms of 3D and 2D segmentation and reconstruction performance on both simulation and real-world datasets, and demonstrates a user case as a robot simulator.

In this study, we propose a novel Shape Guided Transformer Network (SGTN) to accurately extract objects at the instance level. Inspired by the global contextual modeling capacity of the self-attention mechanism, we propose an effective transformer encoder termed LSwin, which incorporates vertical and horizontal 1D global self-attention mechanisms to obtain better global-perception capacity for RSIs than the popular local-shifted-window based Swin Transformer. To achieve accurate instance mask segmentation, we introduce a shape guidance module (SGM) to emphasize the object boundary and shape information. The combination of SGM, which emphasizes the local detail information, and LSwin, which focuses on the global context relationships, achieve excellent RSI instance segmentation. Their effectiveness was validated through comprehensive ablation experiments. Especially, LSwin is proved better than the popular ResNet and Swin transformer encoder at the same level of efficiency. Compared to other instance segmentation methods, our SGTN achieves the highest average precision (AP) scores on two single-class public datasets (WHU dataset and BITCC dataset) and a multi-class public dataset (NWPU VHR-10 dataset).

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video.

However, the deployment of such models has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation, giving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in panoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an unlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance segmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of semantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level adaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix significantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation performance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted instances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the exhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected confirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of degraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based domain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language prompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two mechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular panoptic UDA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | None |

The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard robots, allowing them to leverage communication opportunistically. We integrate the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments demonstrate its accuracy in inter-robot localization and object mapping, along with its moderate demands on computation, storage, and communication resources. The framework is open-sourced and is suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot metric-semantic SLAM applications.

The presence of pathologies, broken structures or limited field-of-view (FOV) can all make anatomy parsing algorithms vulnerable. In this work, we explore how to leverage and implement the successful detection-then-segmentation paradigm for 3D medical data, and propose a steerable, robust, and efficient computing framework for detection, identification, and segmentation of anatomies in CT scans. Considering the complicated shapes, sizes, and orientations of anatomies, without loss of generality, we present a nine degrees of freedom (9-DoF) pose estimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage, non-hierarchical representation. Our whole framework is executed in a steerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to further boost inference efficiency. We have validated our method on three medical imaging parsing tasks: ribs, spine, and abdominal organs. For rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for quantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs. Extensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of our framework (with the identification rate of 97.0% and the segmentation Dice score of 90.9%), compared favorably against several strong baselines (e.g., CenterNet, FCOS, and nnU-Net). For spine parsing and abdominal multi-organ segmentation, our method achieves competitive results on par with state-of-the-art methods on the public CTSpine1K dataset and FLARE22 competition, respectively.

Machine learning (ML) methods for automatically extracting field boundaries from remotely sensed images could help realize the demand for these datasets at a global scale. However, current ML methods for field instance segmentation lack sufficient geographic coverage, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. Further, research on improving ML methods is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets representing the diversity of global agricultural fields. We present Fields of The World (FTW) -- a novel ML benchmark dataset for agricultural field instance segmentation spanning 24 countries on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America). FTW is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets with 70,462 samples, each containing instance and semantic segmentation masks paired with multi-date, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. We provide results from baseline models for the new FTW benchmark, show that models trained on FTW have better zero-shot and fine-tuning performance in held-out countries than models that aren't pre-trained with diverse datasets, and show positive qualitative zero-shot results of FTW models in a real-world scenario -- running on Sentinel-2 scenes over Ethiopia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI-2025 Artificial Intelligence for Social Impact (AISI) track</p></details> | None |

Typically, each box proposal or box query aims to directly maximize the intersection-over-union score with the ground truth, followed by a winner-takes-all non-maximum suppression where only the highest scoring box in each region is retained. We observe that both steps are sub-optimal: the first involves regressing proposals to the entire ground truth, which is a difficult task even with large receptive fields, and the second neglects valuable information from boxes other than the top candidate. Instead of regressing proposals to the whole ground truth, we propose a simpler approach: regress only to the area of intersection between the proposal and the ground truth. This avoids the need for proposals to extrapolate beyond their visual scope, improving localization accuracy. Rather than adopting a winner-takes-all strategy, we take the union over the regressed intersections of all boxes in a region to generate the final box outputs. Our plug-and-play method integrates seamlessly into proposal-based, grid-based, and query-based detection architectures with minimal modifications, consistently improving object localization and instance segmentation. We demonstrate its broad applicability and versatility across various detection and segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Progressive Fine-to-Coarse Reconstruction for Accurate Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14633v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to its efficiency, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has been widely adopted for compressing Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, when quantized into low-bit representations, there is often a significant performance drop compared to their full-precision counterparts. To address this issue, reconstruction methods have been incorporated into the PTQ framework to improve performance in low-bit quantization settings. Nevertheless, existing related methods predefine the reconstruction granularity and seldom explore the progressive relationships between different reconstruction granularities, which leads to sub-optimal quantization results in ViTs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Progressive Fine-to-Coarse Reconstruction (PFCR) method for accurate PTQ, which significantly improves the performance of low-bit quantized vision transformers. Specifically, we define multi-head self-attention and multi-layer perceptron modules along with their shortcuts as the finest reconstruction units. After reconstructing these two fine-grained units, we combine them to form coarser blocks and reconstruct them at a coarser granularity level. We iteratively perform this combination and reconstruction process, achieving progressive fine-to-coarse reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a Progressive Optimization Strategy (POS) for PFCR to alleviate the difficulty of training, thereby further enhancing model performance. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best Top-1 accuracy among state-of-the-art methods, particularly attaining 75.61% for 3-bit quantized ViT-B in PTQ. Besides, quantization results on the COCO dataset reveal the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method on other computer vision tasks like object detection and instance segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current method primarily focus on object-centric representations, supporting object segmentation or detection, while understanding semantic relationships between objects remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose RelationField, the first method to extract inter-object relationships directly from neural radiance fields. RelationField represents relationships between objects as pairs of rays within a neural radiance field, effectively extending its formulation to include implicit relationship queries. To teach RelationField complex, open-vocabulary relationships, relationship knowledge is distilled from multi-modal LLMs. To evaluate RelationField, we solve open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation tasks and relationship-guided instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.

Traditional methodologies for 3D semantic and instance segmentation, such as KpConv, RandLA, Mask3D, etc., are designed to train on extensive labeled datasets to obtain satisfactory performance in practical tasks. This requirement presents a significant challenge, given the inherent scarcity of manually annotated 3D datasets, particularly for the military use cases. Recognizing this gap, our previous research leverages the One World Terrain data repository manually annotated databases, as showcased at IITSEC 2019 and 2021, to enrich the training dataset for deep learning models. However, collecting and annotating large scale 3D data for specific tasks remains costly and inefficient. To this end, the objective of this research is to design and develop a comprehensive and efficient framework for 3D segmentation tasks to assist in 3D data annotation. This framework integrates Grounding DINO and Segment anything Model, augmented by an enhancement in 2D image rendering via 3D mesh. Furthermore, the authors have also developed a user friendly interface that facilitates the 3D annotation process, offering intuitive visualization of rendered images and the 3D point cloud.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Advances in Kidney Biopsy Lesion Assessment through Dense Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17166v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renal biopsies are the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. Lesion scores made by renal pathologists are semi-quantitative and exhibit high inter-observer variability. Automating lesion classification within segmented anatomical structures can provide decision support in quantification analysis, thereby reducing inter-observer variability. Nevertheless, classifying lesions in regions-of-interest (ROIs) is clinically challenging due to (a) a large amount of densely packed anatomical objects, (b) class imbalance across different compartments (at least 3), (c) significant variation in size and shape of anatomical objects and (d) the presence of multi-label lesions per anatomical structure. Existing models cannot address these complexities in an efficient and generic manner. This paper presents an analysis for a \textbf{generalized solution} to datasets from various sources (pathology departments) with different types of lesions. Our approach utilizes two sub-networks: dense instance segmentation and lesion classification. We introduce \textbf{DiffRegFormer}, an end-to-end dense instance segmentation sub-network designed for multi-class, multi-scale objects within ROIs. Combining diffusion models, transformers, and RCNNs, DiffRegFormer {is a computational-friendly framework that can efficiently recognize over 500 objects across three anatomical classes, i.e., glomeruli, tubuli, and arteries, within ROIs.} In a dataset of 303 ROIs from 148 Jones' silver-stained renal Whole Slide Images (WSIs), our approach outperforms previous methods, achieving an Average Precision of 52.1\% (detection) and 46.8\% (segmentation). Moreover, our lesion classification sub-network achieves 89.2\% precision and 64.6\% recall on 21889 object patches out of the 303 ROIs. Lastly, our model demonstrates direct domain transfer to PAS-stained renal WSIs without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that are absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial categories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides, the domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote sensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model when it is directly applied to remote sensing images. To address these challenges, we propose a $\textbf{Z}$ero-Sh$\textbf{o}$t $\textbf{R}$emote Sensing $\textbf{I}$nstance Segmentation framework, dubbed $\textbf{ZoRI}$. Our approach features a discrimination-enhanced classifier that uses refined textual embeddings to increase the awareness of class disparities. Instead of direct fine-tuning, we propose a knowledge-maintained adaptation strategy that decouples semantic-related information to preserve the pretrained vision-language alignment while adjusting features to capture remote sensing domain-specific visual cues. Additionally, we introduce a prior-injected prediction with cache bank of aerial visual prototypes to supplement the semantic richness of text embeddings and seamlessly integrate aerial representations, adapting to the remote sensing domain. We establish new experimental protocols and benchmarks, and extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate that ZoRI achieves the state-of-art performance on the zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation task.

While recent years have seen advances in digital documentation methods, vast amounts of legacy data remain locked in traditional publications. This paper introduces PyPotteryLens, an open-source framework that leverages deep learning to automate the digitisation and processing of archaeological pottery drawings from published sources. The system combines state-of-the-art computer vision models (YOLO for instance segmentation and EfficientNetV2 for classification) with an intuitive user interface, making advanced digital methods accessible to archaeologists regardless of technical expertise.

While earlier work studied general-purpose image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and simple tasks like image recognition, we investigated geo-biases in real-world driving datasets on a more complex task: instance segmentation. We examined if instance segmentation models trained on European driving scenes (Eurocentric models) are geo-biased. Consistent with previous work, we found that Eurocentric models were geo-biased. Interestingly, we found that geo-biases came from classification errors rather than localization errors, with classification errors alone contributing 10-90% of the geo-biases in segmentation and 19-88% of the geo-biases in detection. This showed that while classification is geo-biased, localization (including detection and segmentation) is geographically robust. Our findings show that in region-specific models (e.g., Eurocentric models), geo-biases from classification errors can be significantly mitigated by using coarser classes (e.g., grouping car, bus, and truck as 4-wheeler).</p></details> |  | None |

However, ViTs are computationally expensive and not well suited for mobile devices; this led to the prevalence of convolutional neural network (CNN) and ViT-based hybrid models for mobile vision applications. Recently, Vision GNN (ViG) and CNN hybrid models have also been proposed for mobile vision tasks. However, all of these methods remain slower compared to pure CNN-based models. In this work, we propose Multi-Level Dilated Convolutions to devise a purely CNN-based mobile backbone. Using Multi-Level Dilated Convolutions allows for a larger theoretical receptive field than standard convolutions. Different levels of dilation also allow for interactions between the short-range and long-range features in an image. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) mobile CNN, ViT, ViG, and hybrid architectures in terms of accuracy and/or speed on image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

It has proven to be a powerful tool for the preliminary training of Vision Transformers (ViTs), yielding impressive results across various tasks. Nevertheless, most MIM methods heavily depend on the random masking strategy to formulate the pretext task. This strategy necessitates numerous trials to ascertain the optimal dropping ratio, which can be resource-intensive, requiring the model to be pre-trained for anywhere between 800 to 1600 epochs. Furthermore, this approach may not be suitable for all datasets. In this work, we propose a new masking strategy that effectively helps the model capture global and local features. Based on this masking strategy, SymMIM, our proposed training pipeline for MIM is introduced. SymMIM achieves a new SOTA accuracy of 85.9\% on ImageNet using ViT-Large and surpasses previous SOTA across downstream tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation tasks, and so on.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations limit its deployment on resource-constrained scenarios and real-time applications, such as mobile devices, although considerable efforts have been made in previous works. In this paper, we introduce CAS-ViT: Convolutional Additive Self-attention Vision Transformers, to achieve a balance between efficiency and performance in mobile applications. Firstly, we argue that the capability of token mixers to obtain global contextual information hinges on multiple information interactions, such as spatial and channel domains. Subsequently, we propose Convolutional Additive Token Mixer (CATM) employing underlying spatial and channel attention as novel interaction forms. This module eliminates troublesome complex operations such as matrix multiplication and Softmax. We introduce Convolutional Additive Self-attention(CAS) block hybrid architecture and utilize CATM for each block. And further, we build a family of lightweight networks, which can be easily extended to various downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate CAS-ViT across a variety of vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Our M and T model achieves 83.0\%/84.1\% top-1 with only 12M/21M parameters on ImageNet-1K. Meanwhile, throughput evaluations on GPUs, ONNX, and iPhones also demonstrate superior results compared to other state-of-the-art backbones.

This results in a model that can to quickly adapt to new materials with as little as 5 to 10 images. Furthermore, an uncertainty estimation model is used to finally classify the predictions based on optical contrast. We evaluate our method on eight different datasets comprising five different 2D materials and demonstrate significant improvements over existing techniques in the detection of low-contrast materials such as hexagonal boron nitride.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[STEAM: Squeeze and Transform Enhanced Attention Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09023v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel and spatial attention mechanisms introduced by earlier works enhance the representation abilities of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) but often lead to increased parameter and computation costs. While recent approaches focus solely on efficient feature context modeling for channel attention, we aim to model both channel and spatial attention comprehensively with minimal parameters and reduced computation. Leveraging the principles of relational modeling in graphs, we introduce a constant-parameter module, STEAM: Squeeze and Transform Enhanced Attention Module, which integrates channel and spatial attention to enhance the representation power of CNNs. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a graph-based approach for modeling both channel and spatial attention, utilizing concepts from multi-head graph transformers. Additionally, we introduce Output Guided Pooling (OGP), which efficiently captures spatial context to further enhance spatial attention. We extensively evaluate STEAM for large-scale image classification, object detection and instance segmentation on standard benchmark datasets. STEAM achieves a 2% increase in accuracy over the standard ResNet-50 model with only a meager increase in GFLOPs. Furthermore, STEAM outperforms leading modules ECA and GCT in terms of accuracy while achieving a three-fold reduction in GFLOPs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[XAMI -- A Benchmark Dataset for Artefact Detection in XMM-Newton Optical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17323v3)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reflected or scattered light produce artefacts in astronomical observations that can negatively impact the scientific study. Hence, automated detection of these artefacts is highly beneficial, especially with the increasing amounts of data gathered. Machine learning methods are well-suited to this problem, but currently there is a lack of annotated data to train such approaches to detect artefacts in astronomical observations. In this work, we present a dataset of images from the XMM-Newton space telescope Optical Monitoring camera showing different types of artefacts. We hand-annotated a sample of 1000 images with artefacts which we use to train automated ML methods. We further demonstrate techniques tailored for accurate detection and masking of artefacts using instance segmentation. We adopt a hybrid approach, combining knowledge from both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models and use their advantages in segmentation. The presented method and dataset will advance artefact detection in astronomical observations by providing a reproducible baseline.

It requires to detect, segment, track and describe with rich captions never before seen objects. This challenging task can be addressed by developing "abstractors" which connect a vision model and a language foundation model. Concretely, we connect a multi-scale visual feature extractor and a large language model (LLM) by developing an object abstractor and an object-to-text abstractor. The object abstractor, consisting of a prompt encoder and transformer blocks, introduces spatially-diverse open-world object queries to discover never before seen objects in videos. An inter-query contrastive loss further encourages the diversity of object queries. The object-to-text abstractor is augmented with masked cross-attention and acts as a bridge between the object queries and a frozen LLM to generate rich and descriptive object-centric captions for each detected object. Our generalized approach surpasses the baseline that jointly addresses the tasks of open-world video instance segmentation and dense video object captioning by 13% on never before seen objects, and by 10% on object-centric captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://anwesachoudhuri.github.io/OpenWorldVISCap/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://anwesachoudhuri.github.io/OpenWorldVISCap) |

Recent advancements in generative AI, including text-to-3D and image-to-3D methods, have dramatically reduced the complexity and cost of this process. However, current techniques for editing complex 3D scenes continue to rely on generally interactive multi-step, 2D-to-3D projection methods and diffusion-based techniques, which often lack precision in control and hamper real-time performance. In this work, we propose 3DSceneEditor, a fully 3D-based paradigm for real-time, precise editing of intricate 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting. Unlike conventional methods, 3DSceneEditor operates through a streamlined 3D pipeline, enabling direct manipulation of Gaussians for efficient, high-quality edits based on input prompts.The proposed framework (i) integrates a pre-trained instance segmentation model for semantic labeling; (ii) employs a zero-shot grounding approach with CLIP to align target objects with user prompts; and (iii) applies scene modifications, such as object addition, repositioning, recoloring, replacing, and deletion directly on Gaussians. Extensive experimental results show that 3DSceneEditor achieves superior editing precision and speed with respect to current SOTA 3D scene editing approaches, establishing a new benchmark for efficient and interactive 3D scene customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ziyangyan.github.io/3DSceneEditor</p></details> | [Code Link](https://ziyangyan.github.io/3DSceneEditor) |

It significantly contributes to the development of CV algorithms due to its frequent presence in datasets across various applications, ranging from classification and instance segmentation to 3D reconstruction. The polymorphic shapes and textures of food, coupled with high variation in forms and vast multimodal information, including language descriptions and nutritional data, make food computing a complex and demanding task for modern CV algorithms. 3D food modeling is a new frontier for addressing food related problems, due to its inherent capability to deal with random camera views and its straightforward representation for calculating food portion size. However, the primary hurdle in the development of algorithms for food object analysis is the lack of nutrition values in existing 3D datasets. Moreover, in the broader field of 3D research, there is a critical need for domain-specific test datasets. To bridge the gap between general 3D vision and food computing research, we introduce MetaFood3D. This dataset consists of 743 meticulously scanned and labeled 3D food objects across 131 categories, featuring detailed nutrition information, weight, and food codes linked to a comprehensive nutrition database. Our MetaFood3D dataset emphasizes intra-class diversity and includes rich modalities such as textured mesh files, RGB-D videos, and segmentation masks. Experimental results demonstrate our dataset's strong capabilities in enhancing food portion estimation algorithms, highlight the gap between video captures and 3D scanned data, and showcase the strengths of MetaFood3D in generating synthetic eating occasion data and 3D food objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset is available at https://lorenz.ecn.purdue.edu/~food3d/</p></details> | None |

This model, trained on a mixed dataset of dormant and canopy season apple orchard images, aimed to enhance the segmentation of tree trunks and branches under varying seasonal conditions throughout the year. The model was individually validated across dormant and canopy season images after training the YOLO11-CBAM on the mixed dataset collected over the two seasons. Additional testing of the model during pre-bloom, flower bloom, fruit thinning, and harvest season was performed. The highest recall and precision metrics were observed in the YOLO11x-seg-CBAM and YOLO11m-seg-CBAM respectively. Particularly, YOLO11m-seg with CBAM showed the highest precision of 0.83 as performed for the Trunk class in training, while without the CBAM, YOLO11m-seg achieved 0.80 precision score for the Trunk class. Likewise, for branch class, YOLO11m-seg with CBAM achieved the highest precision score value of 0.75 while without the CBAM, the YOLO11m-seg achieved a precision of 0.73. For dormant season validation, YOLO11x-seg exhibited the highest precision at 0.91. Canopy season validation highlighted YOLO11s-seg with superior precision across all classes, achieving 0.516 for Branch, and 0.64 for Trunk. The modeling approach, trained on two season datasets as dormant and canopy season images, demonstrated the potential of the YOLO11-CBAM integration to effectively detect and segment tree trunks and branches year-round across all seasonal variations.

We present a practical, training-free framework that makes precise video colour editing accessible through an intuitive interface while maintaining professional-quality output. Our key insight is that by decoupling spatial and temporal aspects of colour editing, we can better align with users' natural workflow -- allowing them to focus on precise colour selection in key frames before automatically propagating changes across time. We achieve this through a novel technical framework that combines: (i) a simple point-and-click interface merging grid-based colour selection with automatic instance segmentation for precise spatial control, (ii) bidirectional colour propagation that leverages inherent video motion patterns, and (iii) motion-aware blending that ensures smooth transitions even with complex object movements. Through extensive evaluation on diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods while eliminating the need for training or specialized hardware, making professional-quality video colour editing accessible to everyone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://chaitron.github.io/DreamColour-demo</p></details> | [Code Link](https://chaitron.github.io/DreamColour-demo) |

We analyze the computational bottlenecks of state-of-the-art foundation models that performs OV-VIS, and propose a new method, TROY-VIS, that significantly improves processing speed while maintaining high accuracy. We introduce three key techniques: (1) Decoupled Attention Feature Enhancer to speed up information interaction between different modalities and scales; (2) Flash Embedding Memory for obtaining fast text embeddings of object categories; and, (3) Kernel Interpolation for exploiting the temporal continuity in videos. Our experiments demonstrate that TROY-VIS achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and speed on two large-scale OV-VIS benchmarks, BURST and LV-VIS, running 20x faster than GLEE-Lite (25 FPS v.s. 1.25 FPS) with comparable or even better accuracy. These results demonstrate TROY-VIS's potential for real-time applications in dynamic environments such as mobile robotics and augmented reality.

| **[One Step Learning, One Step Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10962v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual fine-tuning has garnered significant attention with the rise of pre-trained vision models. The current prevailing method, full fine-tuning, suffers from the issue of knowledge forgetting as it focuses solely on fitting the downstream training set. In this paper, we propose a novel weight rollback-based fine-tuning method called OLOR (One step Learning, One step Review). OLOR combines fine-tuning with optimizers, incorporating a weight rollback term into the weight update term at each step. This ensures consistency in the weight range of upstream and downstream models, effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance. In addition, a layer-wise penalty is presented to employ penalty decay and the diversified decay rate to adjust the weight rollback levels of layers for adapting varying downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation, we demonstrate the general applicability and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed OLOR.

| **[Vision Transformers for Weakly-Supervised Microorganism Enumeration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02250v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microorganism enumeration is an essential task in many applications, such as assessing contamination levels or ensuring health standards when evaluating surface cleanliness. However, it's traditionally performed by human-supervised methods that often require manual counting, making it tedious and time-consuming. Previous research suggests automating this task using computer vision and machine learning methods, primarily through instance segmentation or density estimation techniques. This study conducts a comparative analysis of vision transformers (ViTs) for weakly-supervised counting in microorganism enumeration, contrasting them with traditional architectures such as ResNet and investigating ViT-based models such as TransCrowd. We trained different versions of ViTs as the architectural backbone for feature extraction using four microbiology datasets to determine potential new approaches for total microorganism enumeration in images. Results indicate that while ResNets perform better overall, ViTs performance demonstrates competent results across all datasets, opening up promising lines of research in microorganism enumeration. This comparative study contributes to the field of microbial image analysis by presenting innovative approaches to the recurring challenge of microorganism enumeration and by highlighting the capabilities of ViTs in the task of regression counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> | None |

While several deep neural network models have been proposed to tackle those tasks, augmentation methods for COD and CIS have not been thoroughly explored. Augmentation strategies can help improve models' performance by increasing the size and diversity of the training data and exposing the model to a wider range of variations in the data. Besides, we aim to automatically learn transformations that help to reveal the underlying structure of camouflaged objects and allow the model to learn to better identify and segment camouflaged objects. To achieve this, we propose a learnable augmentation method in the frequency domain for COD and CIS via the Fourier transform approach, dubbed CamoFA. Our method leverages a conditional generative adversarial network and cross-attention mechanism to generate a reference image and an adaptive hybrid swapping with parameters to mix the low-frequency component of the reference image and the high-frequency component of the input image. This approach aims to make camouflaged objects more visible for detection and segmentation models. Without bells and whistles, our proposed augmentation method boosts the performance of camouflaged object detectors and instance segmenters by large margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Adapting Pre-Trained Vision Models for Novel Instance Detection and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17859v2)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel Instance Detection and Segmentation (NIDS) aims at detecting and segmenting novel object instances given a few examples of each instance. We propose a unified, simple yet effective framework (NIDS-Net) comprising object proposal generation, embedding creation for both instance templates and proposal regions, and embedding matching for instance label assignment. Leveraging recent advancements in large vision methods, we utilize Grounding DINO and Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain object proposals with accurate bounding boxes and masks. Central to our approach is the generation of high-quality instance embeddings. We utilize foreground feature averages of patch embeddings from the DINOv2 ViT backbone, followed by refinement through a weight adapter mechanism that we introduce. We show experimentally that our weight adapter can adjust the embeddings locally within their feature space and effectively limit overfitting in the few-shot setting. This methodology enables a straightforward matching strategy, resulting in significant performance gains. Our framework surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating notable improvements of 22.3, 46.2, 10.3, and 24.0 in average precision (AP) across four detection datasets. In instance segmentation tasks on seven core datasets of the BOP challenge, our method is around 4.5 times faster than the leading published RGB method and surpasses it by 3.6 AP. NIDS-Net is about 5.7 times faster than the top RGB-D method while maintaining competitive performance.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks.

| **[A2VIS: Amodal-Aware Approach to Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01147v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling occlusion remains a significant challenge for video instance-level tasks like Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Amodal-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (A2VIS), which incorporates amodal representations to achieve a reliable and comprehensive understanding of both visible and occluded parts of objects in a video. The key intuition is that awareness of amodal segmentation through spatiotemporal dimension enables a stable stream of object information. In scenarios where objects are partially or completely hidden from view, amodal segmentation offers more consistency and less dramatic changes along the temporal axis compared to visible segmentation. Hence, both amodal and visible information from all clips can be integrated into one global instance prototype. To effectively address the challenge of video amodal segmentation, we introduce the spatiotemporal-prior Amodal Mask Head, which leverages visible information intra clips while extracting amodal characteristics inter clips. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that A2VIS excels in both MOT and VIS tasks in identifying and tracking object instances with a keen understanding of their full shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.
