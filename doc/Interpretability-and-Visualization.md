| **[xSRL: Safety-Aware Explainable Reinforcement Learning -- Safety as a Product of Explainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19311v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise in simulated environments, such as games, where failures have minimal consequences. However, the deployment of RL agents in real-world systems such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, UAVs, and medical devices demands a higher level of safety and transparency, particularly when facing adversarial threats. Safe RL algorithms have been developed to address these concerns by optimizing both task performance and safety constraints. However, errors are inevitable, and when they occur, it is essential that the RL agents can also explain their actions to human operators. This makes trust in the safety mechanisms of RL systems crucial for effective deployment. Explainability plays a key role in building this trust by providing clear, actionable insights into the agent's decision-making process, ensuring that safety-critical decisions are well understood. While machine learning (ML) has seen significant advances in interpretability and visualization, explainability methods for RL remain limited. Current tools fail to address the dynamic, sequential nature of RL and its needs to balance task performance with safety constraints over time. The re-purposing of traditional ML methods, such as saliency maps, is inadequate for safety-critical RL applications where mistakes can result in severe consequences. To bridge this gap, we propose xSRL, a framework that integrates both local and global explanations to provide a comprehensive understanding of RL agents' behavior. xSRL also enables developers to identify policy vulnerabilities through adversarial attacks, offering tools to debug and patch agents without retraining. Our experiments and user studies demonstrate xSRL's effectiveness in increasing safety in RL systems, making them more reliable and trustworthy for real-world deployment.

| **[GPTDrawer: Enhancing Visual Synthesis through ChatGPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10429v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the burgeoning field of AI-driven image generation, the quest for precision and relevance in response to textual prompts remains paramount. This paper introduces GPTDrawer, an innovative pipeline that leverages the generative prowess of GPT-based models to enhance the visual synthesis process. Our methodology employs a novel algorithm that iteratively refines input prompts using keyword extraction, semantic analysis, and image-text congruence evaluation. By integrating ChatGPT for natural language processing and Stable Diffusion for image generation, GPTDrawer produces a batch of images that undergo successive refinement cycles, guided by cosine similarity metrics until a threshold of semantic alignment is attained. The results demonstrate a marked improvement in the fidelity of images generated in accordance with user-defined prompts, showcasing the system's ability to interpret and visualize complex semantic constructs. The implications of this work extend to various applications, from creative arts to design automation, setting a new benchmark for AI-assisted creative processes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Llama Scope: Extracting Millions of Features from Llama-3.1-8B with Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20526v1)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful unsupervised method for extracting sparse representations from language models, yet scalable training remains a significant challenge. We introduce a suite of 256 SAEs, trained on each layer and sublayer of the Llama-3.1-8B-Base model, with 32K and 128K features. Modifications to a state-of-the-art SAE variant, Top-K SAEs, are evaluated across multiple dimensions. In particular, we assess the generalizability of SAEs trained on base models to longer contexts and fine-tuned models. Additionally, we analyze the geometry of learned SAE latents, confirming that \emph{feature splitting} enables the discovery of new features. The Llama Scope SAE checkpoints are publicly available at~\url{https://huggingface.co/fnlp/Llama-Scope}, alongside our scalable training, interpretation, and visualization tools at \url{https://github.com/OpenMOSS/Language-Model-SAEs}. These contributions aim to advance the open-source Sparse Autoencoder ecosystem and support mechanistic interpretability research by reducing the need for redundant SAE training.</p></details> | 22pages, 12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/OpenMOSS/Language-Model-SAEs) |
| **[Model X-ray:Detecting Backdoored Models via Decision Boundary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17465v2)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks pose a significant security vulnerability for deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling them to operate normally on clean inputs but manipulate predictions when specific trigger patterns occur. Currently, post-training backdoor detection approaches often operate under the assumption that the defender has knowledge of the attack information, logit output from the model, and knowledge of the model parameters. In contrast, our approach functions as a lightweight diagnostic scanning tool offering interpretability and visualization. By accessing the model to obtain hard labels, we construct decision boundaries within the convex combination of three samples. We present an intriguing observation of two phenomena in backdoored models: a noticeable shrinking of areas dominated by clean samples and a significant increase in the surrounding areas dominated by target labels. Leveraging this observation, we propose Model X-ray, a novel backdoor detection approach based on the analysis of illustrated two-dimensional (2D) decision boundaries. Our approach includes two strategies focused on the decision areas dominated by clean samples and the concentration of label distribution, and it can not only identify whether the target model is infected but also determine the target attacked label under the all-to-one attack strategy. Importantly, it accomplishes this solely by the predicted hard labels of clean inputs, regardless of any assumptions about attacks and prior knowledge of the training details of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrated that Model X-ray has outstanding effectiveness and efficiency across diverse backdoor attacks, datasets, and architectures. Besides, ablation studies on hyperparameters and more attack strategies and discussions are also provided.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating Semantic Variation in Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10291v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/zhuxiangru/SemVarBench .</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The only change in the current version update is the replacement of the template with a more precise one</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhuxiangru/SemVarBench) |
| **[Recent advances in interpretable machine learning using structure-based protein representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17726v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) are transforming the field of structural biology. For example, AlphaFold, a groundbreaking neural network for protein structure prediction, has been widely adopted by researchers. The availability of easy-to-use interfaces and interpretable outcomes from the neural network architecture, such as the confidence scores used to color the predicted structures, have made AlphaFold accessible even to non-ML experts. In this paper, we present various methods for representing protein 3D structures from low- to high-resolution, and show how interpretable ML methods can support tasks such as predicting protein structures, protein function, and protein-protein interactions. This survey also emphasizes the significance of interpreting and visualizing ML-based inference for structure-based protein representations that enhance interpretability and knowledge discovery. Developing such interpretable approaches promises to further accelerate fields including drug development and protein design.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OLGA: One-cLass Graph Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09131v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-class learning (OCL) comprises a set of techniques applied when real-world problems have a single class of interest. The usual procedure for OCL is learning a hypersphere that comprises instances of this class and, ideally, repels unseen instances from any other classes. Besides, several OCL algorithms for graphs have been proposed since graph representation learning has succeeded in various fields. These methods may use a two-step strategy, initially representing the graph and, in a second step, classifying its nodes. On the other hand, end-to-end methods learn the node representations while classifying the nodes in one learning process. We highlight three main gaps in the literature on OCL for graphs: (i) non-customized representations for OCL; (ii) the lack of constraints on hypersphere parameters learning; and (iii) the methods' lack of interpretability and visualization. We propose One-cLass Graph Autoencoder (OLGA). OLGA is end-to-end and learns the representations for the graph nodes while encapsulating the interest instances by combining two loss functions. We propose a new hypersphere loss function to encapsulate the interest instances. OLGA combines this new hypersphere loss with the graph autoencoder reconstruction loss to improve model learning. OLGA achieved state-of-the-art results and outperformed six other methods with a statistically significant difference from five methods. Moreover, OLGA learns low-dimensional representations maintaining the classification performance with an interpretable model representation learning and results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StyleInject: Parameter Efficient Tuning of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13942v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to fine-tune generative models for text-to-image generation tasks is crucial, particularly facing the complexity involved in accurately interpreting and visualizing textual inputs. While LoRA is efficient for language model adaptation, it often falls short in text-to-image tasks due to the intricate demands of image generation, such as accommodating a broad spectrum of styles and nuances. To bridge this gap, we introduce StyleInject, a specialized fine-tuning approach tailored for text-to-image models. StyleInject comprises multiple parallel low-rank parameter matrices, maintaining the diversity of visual features. It dynamically adapts to varying styles by adjusting the variance of visual features based on the characteristics of the input signal. This approach significantly minimizes the impact on the original model's text-image alignment capabilities while adeptly adapting to various styles in transfer learning. StyleInject proves particularly effective in learning from and enhancing a range of advanced, community-fine-tuned generative models. Our comprehensive experiments, including both small-sample and large-scale data fine-tuning as well as base model distillation, show that StyleInject surpasses traditional LoRA in both text-image semantic consistency and human preference evaluation, all while ensuring greater parameter efficiency.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[ProtoP-OD: Explainable Object Detection with Prototypical Parts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19142v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretation and visualization of the behavior of detection transformers tends to highlight the locations in the image that the model attends to, but it provides limited insight into the \emph{semantics} that the model is focusing on. This paper introduces an extension to detection transformers that constructs prototypical local features and uses them in object detection. These custom features, which we call prototypical parts, are designed to be mutually exclusive and align with the classifications of the model. The proposed extension consists of a bottleneck module, the prototype neck, that computes a discretized representation of prototype activations and a new loss term that matches prototypes to object classes. This setup leads to interpretable representations in the prototype neck, allowing visual inspection of the image content perceived by the model and a better understanding of the model's reliability. We show experimentally that our method incurs only a limited performance penalty, and we provide examples that demonstrate the quality of the explanations provided by our method, which we argue outweighs the performance penalty.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[Atmospheric Turbulence Removal with Video Sequence Deep Visual Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19041v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atmospheric turbulence poses a challenge for the interpretation and visual perception of visual imagery due to its distortion effects. Model-based approaches have been used to address this, but such methods often suffer from artefacts associated with moving content. Conversely, deep learning based methods are dependent on large and diverse datasets that may not effectively represent any specific content. In this paper, we address these problems with a self-supervised learning method that does not require ground truth. The proposed method is not dependent on any dataset outside of the single data sequence being processed but is also able to improve the quality of any input raw sequences or pre-processed sequences. Specifically, our method is based on an accelerated Deep Image Prior (DIP), but integrates temporal information using pixel shuffling and a temporal sliding window. This efficiently learns spatio-temporal priors leading to a system that effectively mitigates atmospheric turbulence distortions. The experiments show that our method improves visual quality results qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  | None |
