| **[YOLO11 and Vision Transformers based 3D Pose Estimation of Immature Green Fruits in Commercial Apple Orchards for Robotic Thinning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19846v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, a robust method for 3D pose estimation of immature green apples (fruitlets) in commercial orchards was developed, utilizing the YOLO11(or YOLOv11) object detection and pose estimation algorithm alongside Vision Transformers (ViT) for depth estimation (Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) and Depth Anything V2). For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

| **[Video-based Surgical Tool-tip and Keypoint Tracking using Multi-frame Context-driven Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18361v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated tracking of surgical tool keypoints in robotic surgery videos is an essential task for various downstream use cases such as skill assessment, expertise assessment, and the delineation of safety zones. In recent years, the explosion of deep learning for vision applications has led to many works in surgical instrument segmentation, while lesser focus has been on tracking specific tool keypoints, such as tool tips. In this work, we propose a novel, multi-frame context-driven deep learning framework to localize and track tool keypoints in surgical videos. We train and test our models on the annotated frames from the 2015 EndoVis Challenge dataset, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. By leveraging sophisticated deep learning models and multi-frame context, we achieve 90\% keypoint detection accuracy and a localization RMS error of 5.27 pixels. Results on a self-annotated JIGSAWS dataset with more challenging scenarios also show that the proposed multi-frame models can accurately track tool-tip and tool-base keypoints, with ${<}4.2$-pixel RMS error overall. Such a framework paves the way for accurately tracking surgical instrument keypoints, enabling further downstream use cases.

| **[MIFNet: Learning Modality-Invariant Features for Generalizable Multimodal Image Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11299v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many keypoint detection and description methods have been proposed for image matching or registration. While these methods demonstrate promising performance for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion models. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA, CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and Optical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is able to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without accessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability. The source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Empirical Comparison of Four Stereoscopic Depth Sensing Cameras for Robotics Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07421v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth sensing is an essential technology in robotics and many other fields. Many depth sensing (or RGB-D) cameras are available on the market and selecting the best one for your application can be challenging. In this work, we tested four stereoscopic RGB-D cameras that sense the distance by using two images from slightly different views. We empirically compared four cameras (Intel RealSense D435, Intel RealSense D455, StereoLabs ZED 2, and Luxonis OAK-D Pro) in three scenarios: (i) planar surface perception, (ii) plastic doll perception, (iii) household object perception (YCB dataset). We recorded and evaluated more than 3,000 RGB-D frames for each camera. For table-top robotics scenarios with distance to objects up to one meter, the best performance is provided by the D435 camera. For longer distances, the other three models perform better, making them more suitable for some mobile robotics applications. OAK-D Pro additionally offers integrated AI modules (e.g., object and human keypoint detection). ZED 2 is not a standalone device and requires a computer with a GPU for depth data acquisition. All data (more than 12,000 RGB-D frames) are publicly available at https://osf.io/f2seb.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GIMS: Image Matching System Based on Adaptive Graph Construction and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18221v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

| **[A Novel Approach to Tomato Harvesting Using a Hybrid Gripper with Semantic Segmentation and Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16755v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current agriculture and farming industries are able to reap advancements in robotics and automation technology to harvest fruits and vegetables using robots with adaptive grasping forces based on the compliance or softness of the fruit or vegetable. A successful operation depends on using a gripper that can adapt to the mechanical properties of the crops. This paper proposes a new robotic harvesting approach for tomato fruit using a novel hybrid gripper with a soft caging effect. It uses its six flexible passive auxetic structures based on fingers with rigid outer exoskeletons for good gripping strength and shape conformability. The gripper is actuated through a scotch-yoke mechanism using a servo motor. To perform tomato picking operations through a gripper, a vision system based on a depth camera and RGB camera implements the fruit identification process. It incorporates deep learning-based keypoint detection of the tomato's pedicel and body for localization in an occluded and variable ambient light environment and semantic segmentation of ripe and unripe tomatoes. In addition, robust trajectory planning of the robotic arm based on input from the vision system and control of robotic gripper movements are carried out for secure tomato handling. The tunable grasping force of the gripper would allow the robotic handling of fruits with a broad range of compliance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Corn Ear Detection and Orientation Estimation Using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14954v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring growth behavior of maize plants such as the development of ears can give key insights into the plant's health and development. Traditionally, the measurement of the angle of ears is performed manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision-based system for detecting and tracking ears of corn in an image sequence. The proposed system could accurately detect, track, and predict the ear's orientation, which can be useful in monitoring their growth behavior. This can significantly save time compared to manual measurement and enables additional areas of ear orientation research and potential increase in efficiencies for maize production. Using an object detector with keypoint detection, the algorithm proposed could detect 90 percent of all ears. The cardinal estimation had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 18 degrees, compared to a mean 15 degree difference between two people measuring by hand. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using computer vision techniques for monitoring maize growth and can lead to further research in this area.</p></details> | 22 pages;15 figures | None |
| **[CoDeF: Content Deformation Fields for Temporally Consistent Video Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07926v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the content deformation field CoDeF as a new type of video representation, which consists of a canonical content field aggregating the static contents in the entire video and a temporal deformation field recording the transformations from the canonical image (i.e., rendered from the canonical content field) to each individual frame along the time axis. Given a target video, these two fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct it through a carefully tailored rendering pipeline. We advisedly introduce some regularizations into the optimization process, urging the canonical content field to inherit semantics (e.g., the object shape) from the video. With such a design, CoDeF naturally supports lifting image algorithms for video processing, in the sense that one can apply an image algorithm to the canonical image and effortlessly propagate the outcomes to the entire video with the aid of the temporal deformation field. We experimentally show that CoDeF is able to lift image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and lift keypoint detection to keypoint tracking without any training. More importantly, thanks to our lifting strategy that deploys the algorithms on only one image, we achieve superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos compared to existing video-to-video translation approaches, and even manage to track non-rigid objects like water and smog.

| **[Nonlinear optical encoding enabled by recurrent linear scattering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08558v3)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical information processing and computing can potentially offer enhanced performance, scalability and energy efficiency. However, achieving nonlinearity-a critical component of computation-remains challenging in the optical domain. Here we introduce a design that leverages a multiple-scattering cavity to passively induce optical nonlinear random mapping with a continuous-wave laser at a low power. Each scattering event effectively mixes information from different areas of a spatial light modulator, resulting in a highly nonlinear mapping between the input data and output pattern. We demonstrate that our design retains vital information even when the readout dimensionality is reduced, thereby enabling optical data compression. This capability allows our optical platforms to offer efficient optical information processing solutions across applications. We demonstrate our design's efficacy across tasks, including classification, image reconstruction, keypoint detection and object detection, all of which are achieved through optical data compression combined with a digital decoder. In particular, high performance at extreme compression ratios is observed in real-time pedestrian detection. Our findings open pathways for novel algorithms and unconventional architectural designs for optical computing.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[An Efficient Scene Coordinate Encoding and Relocalization Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06488v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) is a visual localization technique that utilizes deep neural networks (DNN) to directly regress 2D-3D correspondences for camera pose estimation. However, current SCR methods often face challenges in handling repetitive textures and meaningless areas due to their reliance on implicit triangulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient scene coordinate encoding and relocalization method. Compared with the existing SCR methods, we design a unified architecture for both scene encoding and salient keypoint detection, enabling our system to focus on encoding informative regions, thereby significantly enhancing efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism that leverages sequential information during both map encoding and relocalization, which strengthens implicit triangulation, particularly in repetitive texture environments. Comprehensive experiments conducted across indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) SCR methods. Our single-frame relocalization mode improves the recall rate of our baseline by 6.4% and increases the running speed from 56Hz to 90Hz. Furthermore, our sequence-based mode increases the recall rate by 11% while maintaining the original efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[RADA: Robust and Accurate Feature Learning with Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15791v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in keypoint detection and descriptor extraction have shown impressive performance in local feature learning tasks. However, existing methods generally exhibit suboptimal performance under extreme conditions such as significant appearance changes and domain shifts. In this study, we introduce a multi-level feature aggregation network that incorporates two pivotal components to facilitate the learning of robust and accurate features with domain adaptation. First, we employ domain adaptation supervision to align high-level feature distributions across different domains to achieve invariant domain representations. Second, we propose a Transformer-based booster that enhances descriptor robustness by integrating visual and geometric information through wave position encoding concepts, effectively handling complex conditions. To ensure the accuracy and robustness of features, we adopt a hierarchical architecture to capture comprehensive information and apply meticulous targeted supervision to keypoint detection, descriptor extraction, and their coupled processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, RADA, achieves excellent results in image matching, camera pose estimation, and visual localization tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ZeroKey: Point-Level Reasoning and Zero-Shot 3D Keypoint Detection from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06292v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel zero-shot approach for keypoint detection on 3D shapes. Point-level reasoning on visual data is challenging as it requires precise localization capability, posing problems even for powerful models like DINO or CLIP. Traditional methods for 3D keypoint detection rely heavily on annotated 3D datasets and extensive supervised training, limiting their scalability and applicability to new categories or domains. In contrast, our method utilizes the rich knowledge embedded within Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we demonstrate, for the first time, that pixel-level annotations used to train recent MLLMs can be exploited for both extracting and naming salient keypoints on 3D models without any ground truth labels or supervision. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks compared to supervised methods, despite not requiring any 3D keypoint annotations during training. Our results highlight the potential of integrating language models for localized 3D shape understanding. This work opens new avenues for cross-modal learning and underscores the effectiveness of MLLMs in contributing to 3D computer vision challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is accessible at https://sites.google.com/view/zerokey</p></details> | None |
| **[Key-Grid: Unsupervised 3D Keypoints Detection using Grid Heatmap Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02237v3)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting 3D keypoints with semantic consistency is widely used in many scenarios such as pose estimation, shape registration and robotics. Currently, most unsupervised 3D keypoint detection methods focus on the rigid-body objects. However, when faced with deformable objects, the keypoints they identify do not preserve semantic consistency well. In this paper, we introduce an innovative unsupervised keypoint detector Key-Grid for both the rigid-body and deformable objects, which is an autoencoder framework. The encoder predicts keypoints and the decoder utilizes the generated keypoints to reconstruct the objects. Unlike previous work, we leverage the identified keypoint in formation to form a 3D grid feature heatmap called grid heatmap, which is used in the decoder section. Grid heatmap is a novel concept that represents the latent variables for grid points sampled uniformly in the 3D cubic space, where these variables are the shortest distance between the grid points and the skeleton connected by keypoint pairs. Meanwhile, we incorporate the information from each layer of the encoder into the decoder section. We conduct an extensive evaluation of Key-Grid on a list of benchmark datasets. Key-Grid achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the semantic consistency and position accuracy of keypoints. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of Key-Grid to noise and downsampling. In addition, we achieve SE-(3) invariance of keypoints though generalizing Key-Grid to a SE(3)-invariant backbone.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Certifiable Algorithm for Simultaneous Shape Estimation and Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16837v3)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications from manipulation to autonomous vehicles rely on robust and general object tracking to safely perform tasks in dynamic environments. We propose the first certifiably optimal category-level approach for simultaneous shape estimation and pose tracking of an object of known category (e.g. a car). Our approach uses 3D semantic keypoint measurements extracted from an RGB-D image sequence, and phrases the estimation as a fixed-lag smoothing problem. Temporal constraints enforce the object's rigidity (fixed shape) and smooth motion according to a constant-twist motion model. The solutions to this problem are the estimates of the object's state (poses, velocities) and shape (paramaterized according to the active shape model) over the smoothing horizon. Our key contribution is to show that despite the non-convexity of the fixed-lag smoothing problem, we can solve it to certifiable optimality using a small-size semidefinite relaxation. We also present a fast outlier rejection scheme that filters out incorrect keypoint detections with shape and time compatibility tests, and wrap our certifiable solver in a graduated non-convexity scheme. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic and real data, showcasing its performance in a table-top manipulation scenario and a drone-based vehicle tracking application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE RA-L. 11 pages, 6 figures (with appendix).

Our approach estimates key geometric features -- including diameter, length, and volume -- for rod-like geometries with varying curvature and general objects with constant skeleton slope. The framework integrates segmentation, mask processing, skeleton construction, and 2D-3D transformation, packaged in a user-friendly interface. We validate our framework by estimating the diameters of Canola stems -- collected from agricultural fields in North Dakota -- which are thin and non-uniform, posing challenges for existing methods. Measuring its diameters is critical, as it is a phenotypic traits that correlates with the health and yield of Canola crops. This application also exemplifies the potential of Measure Anything, where integrating intelligent models -- such as keypoint detection -- extends its scalability to fully automate the measurement process for high-throughput applications. Furthermore, we showcase its versatility in robotic grasping, leveraging extracted geometric features to identify optimal grasp points.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MamKPD: A Simple Mamba Baseline for Real-Time 2D Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01422v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time 2D keypoint detection plays an essential role in computer vision. Although CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved breakthrough progress, they often fail to deliver superior performance and real-time speed. This paper introduces MamKPD, the first efficient yet effective mamba-based pose estimation framework for 2D keypoint detection. The conventional Mamba module exhibits limited information interaction between patches. To address this, we propose a lightweight contextual modeling module (CMM) that uses depth-wise convolutions to model inter-patch dependencies and linear layers to distill the pose cues within each patch. Subsequently, by combining Mamba for global modeling across all patches, MamKPD effectively extracts instances' pose information. We conduct extensive experiments on human and animal pose estimation datasets to validate the effectiveness of MamKPD. Our MamKPD-L achieves 77.3% AP on the COCO dataset with 1492 FPS on an NVIDIA GTX 4090 GPU. Moreover, MamKPD achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPII dataset and competitive results on the AP-10K dataset while saving 85% of the parameters compared to ViTPose.

Cattle's body shape and joint articulation carry significant information about their welfare, yet acquiring comprehensive datasets for 3D body pose estimation presents a formidable challenge. This study delves into the construction of such a dataset specifically tailored for cattle. Leveraging the expertise of digital artists, we use a single animated 3D model to represent diverse cattle postures. To address the disparity between virtual and real-world data, we augment the 3D model's shape to encompass a range of potential body appearances, thereby narrowing the "sim2real" gap. We use these annotated models to train a deep-learning framework capable of estimating internal joints solely based on external surface curvature. Our contribution is specifically the use of geodesic distance over the surface manifold, coupled with multilateration to extract joints in a semantic keypoint detection encoder-decoder architecture. We demonstrate the robustness of joint extraction by comparing the link lengths extracted on real cattle mobbing and walking within a race. Furthermore, inspired by the established allometric relationship between bone length and the overall height of mammals, we utilise the estimated joints to predict hip height within a real cattle dataset, extending the utility of our approach to offer insights into improving cattle monitoring practices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OCDet: Object Center Detection via Bounding Box-Aware Heatmap Prediction on Edge Devices with NPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15653v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time object localization on edge devices is fundamental for numerous applications, ranging from surveillance to industrial automation. Traditional frameworks, such as object detection, segmentation, and keypoint detection, struggle in resource-constrained environments, often resulting in substantial target omissions. To address these challenges, we introduce OCDet, a lightweight Object Center Detection framework optimized for edge devices with NPUs. OCDet predicts heatmaps representing object center probabilities and extracts center points through peak identification. Unlike prior methods using fixed Gaussian distribution, we introduce Generalized Centerness (GC) to generate ground truth heatmaps from bounding box annotations, providing finer spatial details without additional manual labeling. Built on NPU-friendly Semantic FPN with MobileNetV4 backbones, OCDet models are trained by our Balanced Continuous Focal Loss (BCFL), which alleviates data imbalance and focuses training on hard negative examples for probability regression tasks. Leveraging the novel Center Alignment Score (CAS) with Hungarian matching, we demonstrate that OCDet consistently outperforms YOLO11 in object center detection, achieving up to 23% higher CAS while requiring 42% fewer parameters, 34% less computation, and 64% lower NPU latency. When compared to keypoint detection frameworks, OCDet achieves substantial CAS improvements up to 186% using identical models. By integrating GC, BCFL, and CAS, OCDet establishes a new paradigm for efficient and robust object center detection on edge devices with NPUs. The code is released at https://github.com/chen-xin-94/ocdet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/chen-xin-94/ocdet) |

However, these models often struggle with grasping pixel-level semantic details, e.g., the keypoints of an object. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel challenge of Semantic Keypoint Comprehension, which aims to comprehend keypoints across different task scenarios, including keypoint semantic understanding, visual prompt-based keypoint detection, and textual prompt-based keypoint detection. Moreover, we introduce KptLLM, a unified multimodal model that utilizes an identify-then-detect strategy to effectively address these challenges. KptLLM underscores the initial discernment of semantics in keypoints, followed by the precise determination of their positions through a chain-of-thought process. With several carefully designed modules, KptLLM adeptly handles various modality inputs, facilitating the interpretation of both semantic contents and keypoint locations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate KptLLM's superiority in various keypoint detection benchmarks and its unique semantic capabilities in interpreting keypoints.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 | None |

This paper aims to adapt to specific fields at low cost using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). We explore a novel domain shift from a diverse, large pool of internet-sourced data to a small set of data collected by a robot at specific locations, minimizing the need for extensive on-field data collection. Additionally, we introduce a novel module -- the Multi-level Attention-based Adversarial Discriminator (MAAD) -- which can be integrated at the feature extractor level of any detection model. In this study, we incorporate MAAD with CenterNet to simultaneously detect leaf, stem, and vein instances. Our results show significant performance improvements in the unlabeled target domain compared to baseline models, with a 7.5% increase in object detection accuracy and a 5.1% improvement in keypoint detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, how to best control the image content remains an open challenge. We introduce LatentKeypointGAN, a two-stage GAN which is trained end-to-end on the classical GAN objective with internal conditioning on a set of space keypoints. These keypoints have associated appearance embeddings that respectively control the position and style of the generated objects and their parts. A major difficulty that we address with suitable network architectures and training schemes is disentangling the image into spatial and appearance factors without domain knowledge and supervision signals. We demonstrate that LatentKeypointGAN provides an interpretable latent space that can be used to re-arrange the generated images by re-positioning and exchanging keypoint embeddings, such as generating portraits by combining the eyes, nose, and mouth from different images. In addition, the explicit generation of keypoints and matching images enables a new, GAN-based method for unsupervised keypoint detection.</p></details> |  | None |

While effective traditional methods achieve high accuracy, color, and wing feather sexing is exclusive to specific breeds, and vent sexing is invasive and requires trained experts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach inspired by facial gender classification techniques in humans: facial chick sexing. This new method does not require expert knowledge and aims to reduce training time while enhancing animal welfare by minimizing chick manipulation. We develop a comprehensive system for training and inference that includes data collection, facial and keypoint detection, facial alignment, and classification. We evaluate our model on two sets of images: Cropped Full Face and Cropped Middle Face, both of which maintain essential facial features of the chick for further analysis. Our experiment demonstrates the promising viability, with a final accuracy of 81.89%, of this approach for future practices in chick sexing by making them more universally applicable.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods for evaluating robustness rely on collecting and annotating extensive test sets. While this is common practice, the process is labor-intensive and expensive with no guarantee of sufficient coverage across attributes of interest. Recently, model diagnosis frameworks have emerged leveraging user inputs (e.g., text) to assess the vulnerability of the model. However, such dependence on human can introduce bias and limitation given the domain knowledge of particular users. This paper proposes Unsupervised Model Diagnosis (UMO), that leverages generative models to produce semantic counterfactual explanations without any user guidance. Given a differentiable computer vision model (i.e., the target model), UMO optimizes for the most counterfactual directions in a generative latent space. Our approach identifies and visualizes changes in semantics, and then matches these changes to attributes from wide-ranging text sources, such as dictionaries or language models. We validate the framework on multiple vision tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation, keypoint detection). Extensive experiments show that our unsupervised discovery of semantic directions can correctly highlight spurious correlations and visualize the failure mode of target models without any human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches typically require separate models for each garment type, which limits scalability and adaptability. In contrast, this paper presents a unified approach using vision-language models (VLMs) to improve keypoint prediction across various garment categories. By interpreting both visual and semantic information, our model enables robots to manage different garment states with a single model. We created a large-scale synthetic dataset using advanced simulation techniques, allowing scalable training without extensive real-world data. Experimental results indicate that the VLM-based method significantly enhances keypoint detection accuracy and task success rates, providing a more flexible and general solution for robotic garment manipulation. In addition, this research also underscores the potential of VLMs to unify various garment manipulation tasks within a single framework, paving the way for broader applications in home automation and assistive robotics for future.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Keypoint Detection with Distilled Depth Keypoint Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14700v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing unsupervised keypoint detection methods apply artificial deformations to images such as masking a significant portion of images and using reconstruction of original image as a learning objective to detect keypoints. However, this approach lacks depth information in the image and often detects keypoints on the background. To address this, we propose Distill-DKP, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that leverages depth maps and RGB images for keypoint detection in a self-supervised setting. During training, Distill-DKP extracts embedding-level knowledge from a depth-based teacher model to guide an image-based student model with inference restricted to the student. Experiments show that Distill-DKP significantly outperforms previous unsupervised methods by reducing mean L2 error by 47.15% on Human3.6M, mean average error by 5.67% on Taichi, and improving keypoints accuracy by 1.3% on DeepFashion dataset. Detailed ablation studies demonstrate the sensitivity of knowledge distillation across different layers of the network.

The former typically relies on laborious and time-consuming manual annotations, posing considerable challenges in expanding keypoint detection to a broader range of keypoint categories and animal species. The latter, though less dependent on extensive manual input, still requires necessary support images with annotation for reference during testing. To realize zero-shot keypoint detection without any prior annotation, we introduce the Open-Vocabulary Keypoint Detection (OVKD) task, which is innovatively designed to use text prompts for identifying arbitrary keypoints across any species. In pursuit of this goal, we have developed a novel framework named Open-Vocabulary Keypoint Detection with Semantic-feature Matching (KDSM). This framework synergistically combines vision and language models, creating an interplay between language features and local keypoint visual features. KDSM enhances its capabilities by integrating Domain Distribution Matrix Matching (DDMM) and other special modules, such as the Vision-Keypoint Relational Awareness (VKRA) module, improving the framework's generalizability and overall performance.Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that KDSM significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of performance and achieves remarkable success in the OVKD task.Impressively, our method, operating in a zero-shot fashion, still yields results comparable to state-of-the-art few-shot species class-agnostic keypoint detection methods.We will make the source code publicly accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision</p></details> | None |

Most existing models accept either the text prompt (e.g., ``the nose of a cat''), or the visual prompt (e.g., support image with keypoint annotations), to detect the corresponding keypoints in query image, thereby, exhibiting either zero-shot or few-shot detection ability. However, the research on taking multimodal prompt is still underexplored, and the prompt diversity in semantics and language is far from opened. For example, how to handle unseen text prompts for novel keypoint detection and the diverse text prompts like ``Can you detect the nose and ears of a cat?'' In this work, we open the prompt diversity from three aspects: modality, semantics (seen v.s. unseen), and language, to enable a more generalized zero- and few-shot keypoint detection (Z-FSKD). We propose a novel OpenKD model which leverages multimodal prototype set to support both visual and textual prompting. Further, to infer the keypoint location of unseen texts, we add the auxiliary keypoints and texts interpolated from visual and textual domains into training, which improves the spatial reasoning of our model and significantly enhances zero-shot novel keypoint detection. We also found large language model (LLM) is a good parser, which achieves over 96% accuracy to parse keypoints from texts. With LLM, OpenKD can handle diverse text prompts. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Z-FSKD and initiates new ways to deal with unseen text and diverse texts.

To address these challenges, we utilize recent advancements in novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), to enhance localization. 3DGS allows for the compact encoding of both 3D geometry and scene appearance with its spatial features. Our method leverages the dense description maps produced by XFeat's lightweight keypoint detection and description model. We propose distilling these dense keypoint descriptors into 3DGS to improve the model's spatial understanding, leading to more accurate camera pose predictions through 2D-3D correspondences. After estimating an initial pose, we refine it using a photometric warping loss. Benchmarking on popular indoor and outdoor datasets shows that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art Neural Render Pose (NRP) methods, including NeRFMatch and PNeRFLoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://gsplatloc.github.io/</p></details> | None |

To validate the convergence of the Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) algorithm, real-world experiments utilizing fiducial markers for feature detection are conducted before designing the CNN-based feature detector. To address the limitations of fiducial markers, the novel feature detector focuses on extracting keypoints that represent the corners of a more realistic object compared to fiducial markers. A dataset is generated from sample data captured by the camera mounted on the robot end-effector while the robot operates randomly in the task space. The samples are automatically labeled, and the dataset size is increased by flipping and rotation. The CNN model is developed by modifying the VGG-19 pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. While the weights in the base model remain fixed, the fully connected layer's weights are updated to minimize the mean absolute error, defined based on the deviation of predictions from the real pixel coordinates of the corners. The model undergoes two modifications: replacing max-pooling with average-pooling in the base model and implementing an adaptive learning rate that decreases during epochs. These changes lead to a 50 percent reduction in validation loss. Finally, the trained model's reliability is assessed through k-fold cross-validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE 2024)</p></details> | None |

However, collecting the training data necessary to create generic and high-precision models is extremely challenging due to the difficulty of annotation and the diversity of domains. Furthermore, it is difficult to transfer training data across different crops, and although machine learning models effective for specific environments, conditions, or crops have been developed, they cannot be widely applied in actual fields. In this study, we propose a generative data augmentation method (D4) for vineyard shoot detection. D4 uses a pre-trained text-guided diffusion model based on a large number of original images culled from video data collected by unmanned ground vehicles or other means, and a small number of annotated datasets. The proposed method generates new annotated images with background information adapted to the target domain while retaining annotation information necessary for object detection. In addition, D4 overcomes the lack of training data in agriculture, including the difficulty of annotation and diversity of domains. We confirmed that this generative data augmentation method improved the mean average precision by up to 28.65% for the BBox detection task and the average precision by up to 13.73% for the keypoint detection task for vineyard shoot detection. Our generative data augmentation method D4 is expected to simultaneously solve the cost and domain diversity issues of training data generation in agriculture and improve the generalization performance of detection models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Popularised by DensePose for the analysis of humans, authors have since attempted to apply the concept to more categories, but with limited success due to the high cost of manual supervision. In this work, we introduce SHIC, a method to learn canonical maps without manual supervision which achieves better results than supervised methods for most categories. Our idea is to leverage foundation computer vision models such as DINO and Stable Diffusion that are open-ended and thus possess excellent priors over natural categories. SHIC reduces the problem of estimating image-to-template correspondences to predicting image-to-image correspondences using features from the foundation models. The reduction works by matching images of the object to non-photorealistic renders of the template, which emulates the process of collecting manual annotations for this task. These correspondences are then used to supervise high-quality canonical maps for any object of interest. We also show that image generators can further improve the realism of the template views, which provide an additional source of supervision for the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

Current high-performance keypoint detectors often fail to tackle this problem due to their two-stage schemes, under-explored prompt designs, and limited training data. To bridge the gap, we propose X-Pose, a novel end-to-end framework with multi-modal (i.e., visual, textual, or their combinations) prompts to detect multi-object keypoints for any articulated (e.g., human and animal), rigid, and soft objects within a given image. Moreover, we introduce a large-scale dataset called UniKPT, which unifies 13 keypoint detection datasets with 338 keypoints across 1,237 categories over 400K instances. Training with UniKPT, X-Pose effectively aligns text-to-keypoint and image-to-keypoint due to the mutual enhancement of multi-modal prompts based on cross-modality contrastive learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that X-Pose achieves notable improvements of 27.7 AP, 6.44 PCK, and 7.0 AP compared to state-of-the-art non-promptable, visual prompt-based, and textual prompt-based methods in each respective fair setting. More importantly, the in-the-wild test demonstrates X-Pose's strong fine-grained keypoint localization and generalization abilities across image styles, object categories, and poses, paving a new path to multi-object keypoint detection in real applications.

Keypoint detectors, such as spatial autoencoders (SAEs), are a common approach to extracting a low-dimensional representation from high-dimensional image data. SAEs aim at spatial features such as object positions, which are often useful representations in robotic RL. However, whether an SAE is actually able to track objects in the scene and thus yields a spatial state representation well suited for RL tasks has rarely been examined due to a lack of established metrics. In this paper, we propose to assess the performance of an SAE instance by measuring how well keypoints track ground truth objects in images. We present a computationally lightweight metric and use it to evaluate common baseline SAE architectures on image data from a simulated robot task. We find that common SAEs differ substantially in their spatial extraction capability. Furthermore, we validate that SAEs that perform well in our metric achieve superior performance when used in downstream RL. Thus, our metric is an effective and lightweight indicator of RL performance before executing expensive RL training. Building on these insights, we identify three key modifications of SAE architectures to improve tracking performance.</p></details> | 19 pages, 12 figures | None |

In this paper, we aim to learn multi-grained representations, which can effectively describe the image on various granularity levels, thus improving generalization on extensive downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-Grained Contrast method (MGC) for unsupervised representation learning. Specifically, we construct delicate multi-grained correspondences between positive views and then conduct multi-grained contrast by the correspondences to learn more general unsupervised representations. Without pretrained on large-scale dataset, our method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on extensive downstream tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, scene parsing, semantic segmentation and keypoint detection. Moreover, experimental results support the data-efficient property and excellent representation transferability of our method.

Despite the progress made by convolutional neural networks in FSR, the results of existing approaches are not ideal due to their low reconstruction efficiency and insufficient utilization of prior information. Considering that faces are highly structured objects, effectively leveraging facial priors to improve FSR results is a worthwhile endeavor. This paper proposes a novel network architecture called W-Net to address this challenge. W-Net leverages meticulously designed Parsing Block to fully exploit the resolution potential of LR image. We use this parsing map as an attention prior, effectively integrating information from both the parsing map and LR images. Simultaneously, we perform multiple fusions in various dimensions through the W-shaped network structure combined with the LPF(LR-Parsing Map Fusion Module). Additionally, we utilize a facial parsing graph as a mask, assigning different weights and loss functions to key facial areas to balance the performance of our reconstructed facial images between perceptual quality and pixel accuracy. We conducted extensive comparative experiments, not only limited to conventional facial super-resolution metrics but also extending to downstream tasks such as facial recognition and facial keypoint detection. The experiments demonstrate that W-Net exhibits outstanding performance in quantitative metrics, visual quality, and downstream tasks.</p></details> | 15 pages,9 figures | None |

Existing datasets suffer from limitations such as small scale, limited species coverage, and inadequate annotation of keypoints for measuring refined and complex morphological phenotypes of fish body parts. To address this gap, we introduce FishPhenoKey, a comprehensive dataset comprising 23,331 high-resolution images spanning six fish species. Notably, FishPhenoKey includes 22 phenotype-oriented annotations, enabling the capture of intricate morphological phenotypes. Motivated by the nuanced evaluation of these subtle morphologies, we also propose a new evaluation metric, Percentage of Measured Phenotype (PMP). It is designed to assess the accuracy of individual keypoint positions and is highly sensitive to the phenotypes measured using the corresponding keypoints. To enhance keypoint detection accuracy, we further propose a novel loss, Anatomically-Calibrated Regularization (ACR), that can be integrated into keypoint detection models, leveraging biological insights to refine keypoint localization.

SfM is a classic computer vision problem that is solved though iterative minimization of reprojection errors, referred to as Bundle Adjustment (BA), starting from a good initialization. In order to obtain a good enough initialization to BA, conventional methods rely on a sequence of sub-problems (such as pairwise pose estimation, pose averaging or triangulation) which provide an initial solution that can then be refined using BA. In this work we replace these sub-problems by learning a model that takes as input the 2D keypoints detected across multiple views, and outputs the corresponding camera poses and 3D keypoint coordinates. Our model takes advantage of graph neural networks to learn SfM-specific primitives, and we show that it can be used for fast inference of the reconstruction for new and unseen sequences.

Our main contributions are extending articulated neural radiance fields to include a notion of a mirror, making it sample-efficient over potential occlusion regions. Together, our contributions realize a consumer-level 3D motion capture system that starts from off-the-shelf 2D poses by automatically calibrating the camera, estimating mirror orientation, and subsequently lifting 2D keypoint detections to 3D skeleton pose that is used to condition the mirror-aware NeRF.

| **[Video-based Sequential Bayesian Homography Estimation for Soccer Field Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10361v2)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel Bayesian framework is proposed, which explicitly relates the homography of one video frame to the next through an affine transformation while explicitly modelling keypoint uncertainty. The literature has previously used differential homography between subsequent frames, but not in a Bayesian setting. In cases where Bayesian methods have been applied, camera motion is not adequately modelled, and keypoints are treated as deterministic. The proposed method, Bayesian Homography Inference from Tracked Keypoints (BHITK), employs a two-stage Kalman filter and significantly improves existing methods. Existing keypoint detection methods may be easily augmented with BHITK. It enables less sophisticated and less computationally expensive methods to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in most homography evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the homography annotations of the WorldCup and TS-WorldCup datasets have been refined using a custom homography annotation tool that has been released for public use. The refined datasets are consolidated and released as the consolidated and refined WorldCup (CARWC) dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> | None |
| **[An Effective Image Copy-Move Forgery Detection Using Entropy Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11793v2)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image forensics has become increasingly crucial in our daily lives. Among various types of forgeries, copy-move forgery detection has received considerable attention within the academic community. Keypoint-based algorithms, particularly those based on Scale Invariant Feature Transform, have achieved promising outcomes. However, most of keypoint detection algorithms failed to generate sufficient matches when tampered patches were occurred in smooth areas, leading to insufficient matches. Therefore, this paper introduces entropy images to determine the coordinates and scales of keypoints based on Scale Invariant Feature Transform detector, which make the pre-processing more suitable for solving the above problems. Furthermore, an overlapped entropy level clustering algorithm is developed to mitigate the increased matching complexity caused by the non-ideal distribution of gray values in keypoints. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a good balance between performance and time efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Visual Grounding and Generalization: A Multi-Task Cycle Training Approach for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12327v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding (VG) occupies a pivotal position in multi-modality vision-language models. In this study, we propose ViLaM, a large multi-modality model, that supports multi-tasks of VG using the cycle training strategy, with abundant interaction instructions. The cycle training between referring expression generation (REG) and referring expression comprehension (REC) is introduced. It enhances the consistency between visual location and referring expressions, and addresses the need for high-quality, multi-tasks VG datasets. Moreover, multi-tasks of VG are promoted in our model, contributed by the cycle training strategy. The multi-tasks in REC encompass a range of granularities, from region-level to pixel-level, which include referring bbox detection, referring keypoints detection, and referring image segmentation. In REG, referring region classification determines the fine-grained category of the target, while referring region captioning generates a comprehensive description. Meanwhile, all tasks participate in the joint training, synergistically enhancing one another and collectively improving the overall performance of the model. Furthermore, leveraging the capabilities of large language models, ViLaM extends a wide range of instructions, thereby significantly enhancing its generalization and interaction potentials. Extensive public datasets corroborate the superior capabilities of our model in VG with muti-tasks. Additionally, validating its robust generalization, ViLaM is validated under open-set and few-shot scenarios. Especially in the medical field, our model demonstrates cross-domain robust generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we contribute a VG dataset, especially with multi-tasks. To support and encourage the community focused on VG, we have made both the dataset and our code public: https://github.com/AnonymGiant/ViLaM.</p></details> | 22 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/AnonymGiant/ViLaM) |
| **[SkelFormer: Markerless 3D Pose and Shape Estimation using Skeletal Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12625v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SkelFormer, a novel markerless motion capture pipeline for multi-view human pose and shape estimation. Our method first uses off-the-shelf 2D keypoint estimators, pre-trained on large-scale in-the-wild data, to obtain 3D joint positions. Next, we design a regression-based inverse-kinematic skeletal transformer that maps the joint positions to pose and shape representations from heavily noisy observations. This module integrates prior knowledge about pose space and infers the full pose state at runtime. Separating the 3D keypoint detection and inverse-kinematic problems, along with the expressive representations learned by our skeletal transformer, enhance the generalization of our method to unseen noisy data. We evaluate our method on three public datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings using three datasets, and observe strong performance with respect to prior works. Moreover, ablation experiments demonstrate the impact of each of the modules of our architecture. Finally, we study the performance of our method in dealing with noise and heavy occlusions and find considerable robustness with respect to other solutions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |
