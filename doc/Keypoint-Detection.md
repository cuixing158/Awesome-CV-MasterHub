| **[YOLO11 and Vision Transformers based 3D Pose Estimation of Immature Green Fruits in Commercial Apple Orchards for Robotic Thinning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19846v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, a robust method for 3D pose estimation of immature green apples (fruitlets) in commercial orchards was developed, utilizing the YOLO11(or YOLOv11) object detection and pose estimation algorithm alongside Vision Transformers (ViT) for depth estimation (Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) and Depth Anything V2). For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

| **[Transfer Learning for Keypoint Detection in Low-Resolution Thermal TUG Test Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18453v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a novel approach to human keypoint detection in low-resolution thermal images using transfer learning techniques. We introduce the first application of the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test in thermal image computer vision, establishing a new paradigm for mobility assessment. Our method leverages a MobileNetV3-Small encoder and a ViTPose decoder, trained using a composite loss function that balances latent representation alignment and heatmap accuracy. The model was evaluated using the Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS) metric from the COCO Keypoint Detection Challenge. The proposed model achieves better performance with AP, AP50, and AP75 scores of 0.861, 0.942, and 0.887 respectively, outperforming traditional supervised learning approaches like Mask R-CNN and ViTPose-Base. Moreover, our model demonstrates superior computational efficiency in terms of parameter count and FLOPS. This research lays a solid foundation for future clinical applications of thermal imaging in mobility assessment and rehabilitation monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AICAS 2025.

| **[Video-based Surgical Tool-tip and Keypoint Tracking using Multi-frame Context-driven Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18361v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated tracking of surgical tool keypoints in robotic surgery videos is an essential task for various downstream use cases such as skill assessment, expertise assessment, and the delineation of safety zones. In recent years, the explosion of deep learning for vision applications has led to many works in surgical instrument segmentation, while lesser focus has been on tracking specific tool keypoints, such as tool tips. In this work, we propose a novel, multi-frame context-driven deep learning framework to localize and track tool keypoints in surgical videos. We train and test our models on the annotated frames from the 2015 EndoVis Challenge dataset, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. By leveraging sophisticated deep learning models and multi-frame context, we achieve 90\% keypoint detection accuracy and a localization RMS error of 5.27 pixels. Results on a self-annotated JIGSAWS dataset with more challenging scenarios also show that the proposed multi-frame models can accurately track tool-tip and tool-base keypoints, with ${<}4.2$-pixel RMS error overall. Such a framework paves the way for accurately tracking surgical instrument keypoints, enabling further downstream use cases.

| **[MIFNet: Learning Modality-Invariant Features for Generalizable Multimodal Image Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11299v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many keypoint detection and description methods have been proposed for image matching or registration. While these methods demonstrate promising performance for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion models. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA, CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and Optical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is able to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without accessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability. The source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph of Feature Map for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs of the human body can be obtained in the human brain to help humans complete the human pose estimation (HPE). It contains a hierarchical structure, like a tree structure, and context relations among nodes. Many researchers pre-design the parse graph of body structure, and then design framework for HPE. However, these frameworks are difficulty adapting when encountering situations that differ from the preset human structure. Different from them, we regard the feature map as a whole, similarly to human body, so the feature map can be optimized based on parse graphs and each node feature is learned implicitly instead of explicitly, which means it can flexibly respond to different human body structure. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse Graph of feature map (RMPG), which includes two stages: top-down decomposition and bottom-up combination. In the top-down decomposition stage, the feature map is decomposed into multiple sub-feature maps along the channel and their context relations are calculated to obtain their respective context information. In the bottom-up combination stage, the sub-feature maps and their context information are combined to obtain refined sub-feature maps, and then these refined sub-feature maps are concatenated to obtain the refined feature map. Additionally ,we design a top-down framework by using multiple RMPG modules for HPE, some of which are supervised to obtain context relations among body parts. Our framework achieves excellent results on the COCO keypoint detection, CrowdPose and MPII human pose datasets. More importantly, our experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of RMPG on different methods, including SimpleBaselines, Hourglass, and ViTPose.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Empirical Comparison of Four Stereoscopic Depth Sensing Cameras for Robotics Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07421v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth sensing is an essential technology in robotics and many other fields. Many depth sensing (or RGB-D) cameras are available on the market and selecting the best one for your application can be challenging. In this work, we tested four stereoscopic RGB-D cameras that sense the distance by using two images from slightly different views. We empirically compared four cameras (Intel RealSense D435, Intel RealSense D455, StereoLabs ZED 2, and Luxonis OAK-D Pro) in three scenarios: (i) planar surface perception, (ii) plastic doll perception, (iii) household object perception (YCB dataset). We recorded and evaluated more than 3,000 RGB-D frames for each camera. For table-top robotics scenarios with distance to objects up to one meter, the best performance is provided by the D435 camera. For longer distances, the other three models perform better, making them more suitable for some mobile robotics applications. OAK-D Pro additionally offers integrated AI modules (e.g., object and human keypoint detection). ZED 2 is not a standalone device and requires a computer with a GPU for depth data acquisition. All data (more than 12,000 RGB-D frames) are publicly available at https://osf.io/f2seb.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GIMS: Image Matching System Based on Adaptive Graph Construction and Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18221v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

| **[A Novel Approach to Tomato Harvesting Using a Hybrid Gripper with Semantic Segmentation and Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16755v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current agriculture and farming industries are able to reap advancements in robotics and automation technology to harvest fruits and vegetables using robots with adaptive grasping forces based on the compliance or softness of the fruit or vegetable. A successful operation depends on using a gripper that can adapt to the mechanical properties of the crops. This paper proposes a new robotic harvesting approach for tomato fruit using a novel hybrid gripper with a soft caging effect. It uses its six flexible passive auxetic structures based on fingers with rigid outer exoskeletons for good gripping strength and shape conformability. The gripper is actuated through a scotch-yoke mechanism using a servo motor. To perform tomato picking operations through a gripper, a vision system based on a depth camera and RGB camera implements the fruit identification process. It incorporates deep learning-based keypoint detection of the tomato's pedicel and body for localization in an occluded and variable ambient light environment and semantic segmentation of ripe and unripe tomatoes. In addition, robust trajectory planning of the robotic arm based on input from the vision system and control of robotic gripper movements are carried out for secure tomato handling. The tunable grasping force of the gripper would allow the robotic handling of fruits with a broad range of compliance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Corn Ear Detection and Orientation Estimation Using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14954v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring growth behavior of maize plants such as the development of ears can give key insights into the plant's health and development. Traditionally, the measurement of the angle of ears is performed manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this paper presents a computer vision-based system for detecting and tracking ears of corn in an image sequence. The proposed system could accurately detect, track, and predict the ear's orientation, which can be useful in monitoring their growth behavior. This can significantly save time compared to manual measurement and enables additional areas of ear orientation research and potential increase in efficiencies for maize production. Using an object detector with keypoint detection, the algorithm proposed could detect 90 percent of all ears. The cardinal estimation had a mean absolute error (MAE) of 18 degrees, compared to a mean 15 degree difference between two people measuring by hand. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using computer vision techniques for monitoring maize growth and can lead to further research in this area.</p></details> | 22 pages;15 figures | None |
