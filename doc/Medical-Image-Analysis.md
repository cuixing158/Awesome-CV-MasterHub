| **[The Devil is in the Prompts: De-Identification Traces Enhance Memorization Risks in Synthetic Chest X-Ray Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07516v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, particularly text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, play a crucial role in medical image analysis. However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1) prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced to hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all tokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization. This highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. To exacerbate, existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens. On this front, we propose actionable strategies for different stakeholders to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Weakly-supervised learning, which allows less precise labels, has become a promising solution to this challenge. Building on this approach, we propose QMaxViT-Unet+, a novel framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation. This framework is built on the U-Net architecture, with the encoder and decoder replaced by Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) blocks. These blocks enhance the model's ability to learn local and global features efficiently. Additionally, our approach integrates a query-based Transformer decoder to refine features and an edge enhancement module to compensate for the limited boundary information in the scribble label. We evaluate the proposed QMaxViT-Unet+ on four public datasets focused on cardiac structures, colorectal polyps, and breast cancer: ACDC, MS-CMRSeg, SUN-SEG, and BUSI. Evaluation metrics include the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95). Experimental results show that QMaxViT-Unet+ achieves 89.1\% DSC and 1.316mm HD95 on ACDC, 88.4\% DSC and 2.226mm HD95 on MS-CMRSeg, 71.4\% DSC and 4.996mm HD95 on SUN-SEG, and 69.4\% DSC and 50.122mm HD95 on BUSI. These results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency while remaining competitive with fully-supervised learning approaches. This makes it ideal for medical image analysis, where high-quality annotations are often scarce and require significant effort and expense.

| **[ActiveSSF: An Active-Learning-Guided Self-Supervised Framework for Long-Tailed Megakaryocyte Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08200v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise classification of megakaryocytes is crucial for diagnosing myelodysplastic syndromes. Although self-supervised learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, its application to classifying megakaryocytes in stained slides faces three main challenges: (1) pervasive background noise that obscures cellular details, (2) a long-tailed distribution that limits data for rare subtypes, and (3) complex morphological variations leading to high intra-class variability. To address these issues, we propose the ActiveSSF framework, which integrates active learning with self-supervised pretraining. Specifically, our approach employs Gaussian filtering combined with K-means clustering and HSV analysis (augmented by clinical prior knowledge) for accurate region-of-interest extraction; an adaptive sample selection mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds to mitigate class imbalance; and prototype clustering on labeled samples to overcome morphological complexity. Experimental results on clinical megakaryocyte datasets demonstrate that ActiveSSF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly improves recognition accuracy for rare subtypes. Moreover, the integration of these advanced techniques further underscores the practical potential of ActiveSSF in clinical settings. To foster further research, the code and datasets will be publicly released in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, submitted to EMBC 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[SegVol: Universal and Interactive Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13385v5)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise image segmentation provides clinical study with instructive information. Despite the remarkable progress achieved in medical image segmentation, there is still an absence of a 3D foundation segmentation model that can segment a wide range of anatomical categories with easy user interaction. In this paper, we propose a 3D foundation segmentation model, named SegVol, supporting universal and interactive volumetric medical image segmentation. By scaling up training data to 90K unlabeled Computed Tomography (CT) volumes and 6K labeled CT volumes, this foundation model supports the segmentation of over 200 anatomical categories using semantic and spatial prompts. To facilitate efficient and precise inference on volumetric images, we design a zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism. Extensive experiments on 22 anatomical segmentation tasks verify that SegVol outperforms the competitors in 19 tasks, with improvements up to 37.24% compared to the runner-up methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness and importance of specific designs by ablation study. We expect this foundation model can promote the development of volumetric medical image analysis. The model and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/SegVol.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/SegVol) |
| **[Prototype Contrastive Consistency Learning for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06650v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, but it can be very challenging especially when there are less labeled data but with large unlabeled data. Contrastive learning has proven to be effective for medical image segmentation in semi-supervised learning by constructing contrastive samples from partial pixels. However, although previous contrastive learning methods can mine semantic information from partial pixels within images, they ignore the whole context information of unlabeled images, which is very important to precise segmentation. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel prototype contrastive learning method called Prototype Contrastive Consistency Segmentation (PCCS) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The core idea is to enforce the prototypes of the same semantic class to be closer and push the prototypes in different semantic classes far away from each other. Specifically, we construct a signed distance map and an uncertainty map from unlabeled images. The signed distance map is used to construct prototypes for contrastive learning, and then we estimate the prototype uncertainty from the uncertainty map as trade-off among prototypes. In order to obtain better prototypes, based on the student-teacher architecture, a new mechanism named prototype updating prototype is designed to assist in updating the prototypes for contrastive learning. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-consistency loss to mine more reliable information from unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation demonstrate that PCCS achieves better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Multi-Scale Transformer Architecture for Accurate Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06243v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces an AI-driven skin lesion classification algorithm built on an enhanced Transformer architecture, addressing the challenges of accuracy and robustness in medical image analysis. By integrating a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism and refining the self-attention process, the model effectively extracts both global and local features, enhancing its ability to detect lesions with ambiguous boundaries and intricate structures. Performance evaluation on the ISIC 2017 dataset demonstrates that the improved Transformer surpasses established AI models, including ResNet50, VGG19, ResNext, and Vision Transformer, across key metrics such as accuracy, AUC, F1-Score, and Precision. Grad-CAM visualizations further highlight the interpretability of the model, showcasing strong alignment between the algorithm's focus areas and actual lesion sites. This research underscores the transformative potential of advanced AI models in medical imaging, paving the way for more accurate and reliable diagnostic tools. Future work will explore the scalability of this approach to broader medical imaging tasks and investigate the integration of multimodal data to enhance AI-driven diagnostic frameworks for intelligent healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SACNet: A Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network for 2D Multi-organ Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10157v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-organ segmentation in medical image analysis is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many factors complicate the task, including variability in different target categories and interference from complex backgrounds. In this paper, we utilize the knowledge of Deformable Convolution V3 (DCNv3) and multi-object segmentation to optimize our Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network (SACNet) in three aspects: feature extraction, model architecture, and loss constraint, simultaneously enhancing the perception of different segmentation targets. Firstly, we propose the Adaptive Receptive Field Module (ARFM), which combines DCNv3 with a series of customized block-level and architecture-level designs similar to transformers. This module can capture the unique features of different organs by adaptively adjusting the receptive field according to various targets. Secondly, we utilize ARFM as building blocks to construct the encoder-decoder of SACNet and partially share parameters between the encoder and decoder, making the network wider rather than deeper. This design achieves a shared lightweight decoder and a more parameter-efficient and effective framework. Lastly, we propose a novel continuity dynamic adjustment loss function, based on t-vMF dice loss and cross-entropy loss, to better balance easy and complex classes in segmentation. Experiments on 3D slice datasets from ACDC and Synapse demonstrate that SACNet delivers superior segmentation performance in multi-organ segmentation tasks compared to several existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BIBM 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[L2GNet: Optimal Local-to-Global Representation of Anatomical Structures for Generalized Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05229v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Latent Space (CLS) and Discrete Latent Space (DLS) models, like AttnUNet and VQUNet, have excelled in medical image segmentation. In contrast, Synergistic Continuous and Discrete Latent Space (CDLS) models show promise in handling fine and coarse-grained information. However, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. CLS or CDLS-based models, such as TransUNet or SynergyNet are adept at capturing long-range dependencies. Since they rely heavily on feature pooling or aggregation using self-attention, they may capture dependencies among redundant regions. This hinders comprehension of anatomical structure content, poses challenges in modeling intra-class and inter-class dependencies, increases false negatives and compromises generalization. Addressing these issues, we propose L2GNet, which learns global dependencies by relating discrete codes obtained from DLS using optimal transport and aligning codes on a trainable reference. L2GNet achieves discriminative on-the-fly representation learning without an additional weight matrix in self-attention models, making it computationally efficient for medical applications. Extensive experiments on multi-organ segmentation and cardiac datasets demonstrate L2GNet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, including the CDLS method SynergyNet, offering an novel approach to enhance deep learning models' performance in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Synthetic Poisoning Attacks: The Impact of Poisoned MRI Image on U-Net Brain Tumor Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03825v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based medical image segmentation models, such as U-Net, rely on high-quality annotated datasets to achieve accurate predictions. However, the increasing use of generative models for synthetic data augmentation introduces potential risks, particularly in the absence of rigorous quality control. In this paper, we investigate the impact of synthetic MRI data on the robustness and segmentation accuracy of U-Net models for brain tumor segmentation. Specifically, we generate synthetic T1-contrast-enhanced (T1-Ce) MRI scans using a GAN-based model with a shared encoding-decoding framework and shortest-path regularization. To quantify the effect of synthetic data contamination, we train U-Net models on progressively "poisoned" datasets, where synthetic data proportions range from 16.67% to 83.33%. Experimental results on a real MRI validation set reveal a significant performance degradation as synthetic data increases, with Dice coefficients dropping from 0.8937 (33.33% synthetic) to 0.7474 (83.33% synthetic). Accuracy and sensitivity exhibit similar downward trends, demonstrating the detrimental effect of synthetic data on segmentation robustness. These findings underscore the importance of quality control in synthetic data integration and highlight the risks of unregulated synthetic augmentation in medical image analysis. Our study provides critical insights for the development of more reliable and trustworthy AI-driven medical imaging systems.</p></details> |  | None |
