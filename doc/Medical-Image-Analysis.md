| **[Fair Foundation Models for Medical Image Analysis: Challenges and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16841v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring equitable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare demands systems that make unbiased decisions across all demographic groups, bridging technical innovation with ethical principles. Foundation Models (FMs), trained on vast datasets through self-supervised learning, enable efficient adaptation across medical imaging tasks while reducing dependency on labeled data. These models demonstrate potential for enhancing fairness, though significant challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across demographic groups. Our review indicates that effective bias mitigation in FMs requires systematic interventions throughout all stages of development. While previous approaches focused primarily on model-level bias mitigation, our analysis reveals that fairness in FMs requires integrated interventions throughout the development pipeline, from data documentation to deployment protocols. This comprehensive framework advances current knowledge by demonstrating how systematic bias mitigation, combined with policy engagement, can effectively address both technical and institutional barriers to equitable AI in healthcare. The development of equitable FMs represents a critical step toward democratizing advanced healthcare technologies, particularly for underserved populations and regions with limited medical infrastructure and computational resources.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the existing skin lesion segmentation and classification prediction models run independently, thus missing potential efficiencies from their integrated execution. To unify skin lesion analysis, our paper presents the Gaussian Splatting - Transformer UNet (GS-TransUNet), a novel approach that synergistically combines 2D Gaussian splatting with the Transformer UNet architecture for automated skin cancer diagnosis. Our unified deep learning model efficiently delivers dual-function skin lesion classification and segmentation for clinical diagnosis. Evaluated on ISIC-2017 and PH2 datasets, our network demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics through 5-fold cross-validation. Our findings illustrate significant advancements in the precision of segmentation and classification. This integration sets new benchmarks in the field and highlights the potential for further research into multi-task medical image analysis methodologies, promising enhancements in automated diagnostic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, SPIE Medical Imaging 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Point Cloud Upsampling as Statistical Shape Model for Pelvic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16716v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework that integrates medical image segmentation and point cloud upsampling for accurate shape reconstruction of pelvic models. Using the SAM-Med3D model for segmentation and a point cloud upsampling network trained on the MedShapeNet dataset, our method transforms sparse medical imaging data into high-resolution 3D bone models. This framework leverages prior knowledge of anatomical shapes, achieving smoother and more complete reconstructions. Quantitative evaluations using metrics such as Chamfer Distance etc, demonstrate the effectiveness of the point cloud upsampling in pelvic model. Our approach offers potential applications in reconstructing other skeletal structures, providing a robust solution for medical image analysis and statistical shape modeling.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[Dataset Distillation in Medical Imaging: A Feasibility Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14429v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data sharing in the medical image analysis field has potential yet remains underappreciated. The aim is often to share datasets efficiently with other sites to train models effectively. One possible solution is to avoid transferring the entire dataset while still achieving similar model performance. Recent progress in data distillation within computer science offers promising prospects for sharing medical data efficiently without significantly compromising model effectiveness. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods would be applicable to medical imaging, since medical and natural images are distinct fields. Moreover, it is intriguing to consider what level of performance could be achieved with these methods. To answer these questions, we conduct investigations on a variety of leading data distillation methods, in different contexts of medical imaging. We evaluate the feasibility of these methods with extensive experiments in two aspects: 1) Assess the impact of data distillation across multiple datasets characterized by minor or great variations. 2) Explore the indicator to predict the distillation performance. Our extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets reveal that data distillation can significantly reduce dataset size while maintaining comparable model performance to that achieved with the full dataset, suggesting that a small, representative sample of images can serve as a reliable indicator of distillation success. This study demonstrates that data distillation is a viable method for efficient and secure medical data sharing, with the potential to facilitate enhanced collaborative research and clinical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Knowledge Distillation-Based Approach to Enhance Transparency of Classifier Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15959v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the medical field, the need for its explainability has grown. In medical image analysis, a high degree of transparency and model interpretability can help clinicians better understand and trust the decision-making process of AI models. In this study, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD)-based approach that aims to enhance the transparency of the AI model in medical image analysis. The initial step is to use traditional CNN to obtain a teacher model and then use KD to simplify the CNN architecture, retain most of the features of the data set, and reduce the number of network layers. It also uses the feature map of the student model to perform hierarchical analysis to identify key features and decision-making processes. This leads to intuitive visual explanations. We selected three public medical data sets (brain tumor, eye disease, and Alzheimer's disease) to test our method. It shows that even when the number of layers is reduced, our model provides a remarkable result in the test set and reduces the time required for the interpretability analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Lung-DDPM: Semantic Layout-guided Diffusion Models for Thoracic CT Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15204v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-assisted medical imaging analysis demonstrates remarkable performance in early lung cancer screening. However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4$\times$, 3.1$\times$, and 29.5$\times$ better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a dice coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8\% and 18.6\% improvements in DICE and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM) |
| **[Vision Foundation Models in Medical Image Analysis: Advances and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14584v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), particularly Vision Transformers (ViT) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), has sparked significant advances in the field of medical image analysis. These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and achieving high generalization in segmentation tasks. However, adapting these large models to medical image analysis presents several challenges, including domain differences between medical and natural images, the need for efficient model adaptation strategies, and the limitations of small-scale medical datasets. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on the adaptation of VFMs to medical image segmentation, focusing on the challenges of domain adaptation, model compression, and federated learning. We discuss the latest developments in adapter-based improvements, knowledge distillation techniques, and multi-scale contextual feature modeling, and propose future directions to overcome these bottlenecks. Our analysis highlights the potential of VFMs, along with emerging methodologies such as federated learning and model compression, to revolutionize medical image analysis and enhance clinical applications. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of current approaches and suggest key areas for future research that can drive the next wave of innovation in medical image segmentation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 1 figure | None |

We challenge this common choice by introducing MedFuncta, a modality-agnostic continuous data representation based on neural fields. We demonstrate how to scale neural fields from single instances to large datasets by exploiting redundancy in medical signals and by applying an efficient meta-learning approach with a context reduction scheme. We further address the spectral bias in commonly used SIREN activations, by introducing an $\omega_0$-schedule, improving reconstruction quality and convergence speed. We validate our proposed approach on a large variety of medical signals of different dimensions and modalities (1D: ECG; 2D: Chest X-ray, Retinal OCT, Fundus Camera, Dermatoscope, Colon Histopathology, Cell Microscopy; 3D: Brain MRI, Lung CT) and successfully demonstrate that we can solve relevant downstream tasks on these representations. We additionally release a large-scale dataset of > 550k annotated neural fields to promote research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Dataset: https://github.com/pfriedri/medfuncta</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/pfriedri/medfuncta) |
| **[H3DE-Net: Efficient and Accurate 3D Landmark Detection in Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14221v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D landmark detection is a critical task in medical image analysis, and accurately detecting anatomical landmarks is essential for subsequent medical imaging tasks. However, mainstream deep learning methods in this field struggle to simultaneously capture fine-grained local features and model global spatial relationships, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomical details, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationships within complex anatomical structures. The high-dimensional nature of 3D volume further exacerbates these challenges, as landmarks are sparsely distributed, leading to significant computational costs. Therefore, achieving efficient and precise 3D landmark detection remains a pressing challenge in medical image analysis. In this work, We propose a \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{3}D \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{Net}(H3DE-Net), a novel framework that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with a lightweight attention mechanism designed to efficiently capture global dependencies in 3D volumetric data. This mechanism employs a hierarchical routing strategy to reduce computational cost while maintaining global context modeling. To our knowledge, H3DE-Net is the first 3D landmark detection model that integrates such a lightweight attention mechanism with CNNs. Additionally, integrating multi-scale feature fusion further enhances detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on a public CT dataset demonstrate that H3DE-Net achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, significantly improving accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with missing landmarks or complex anatomical variations. We aready open-source our project, including code, data and model weights.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MobileViM: A Light-weight and Dimension-independent Vision Mamba for 3D Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13524v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in healthcare. Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible through: https://github.com/anthonyweidai/MobileViM_3D/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/anthonyweidai/MobileViM_3D) |
| **[Enhancing Chest X-ray Classification through Knowledge Injection in Cross-Modality Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13447v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of artificial intelligence in medical imaging has shown tremendous potential, yet the relationship between pre-trained knowledge and performance in cross-modality learning remains unclear. This study investigates how explicitly injecting medical knowledge into the learning process affects the performance of cross-modality classification, focusing on Chest X-ray (CXR) images. We introduce a novel Set Theory-based knowledge injection framework that generates captions for CXR images with controllable knowledge granularity. Using this framework, we fine-tune CLIP model on captions with varying levels of medical information. We evaluate the model's performance through zero-shot classification on the CheXpert dataset, a benchmark for CXR classification. Our results demonstrate that injecting fine-grained medical knowledge substantially improves classification accuracy, achieving 72.5\% compared to 49.9\% when using human-generated captions. This highlights the crucial role of domain-specific knowledge in medical cross-modality learning. Furthermore, we explore the influence of knowledge density and the use of domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) for caption generation, finding that denser knowledge and specialized LLMs contribute to enhanced performance. This research advances medical image analysis by demonstrating the effectiveness of knowledge injection for improving automated CXR classification, paving the way for more accurate and reliable diagnostic tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP'25</p></details> | None |
| **[Medical Image Registration Meets Vision Foundation Model: Prototype Learning and Contour Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11440v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiming to establish spatial correspondences between paired images. However, existing unsupervised deformable registration methods rely solely on intensity-based similarity metrics, lacking explicit anatomical knowledge, which limits their accuracy and robustness. Vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can generate high-quality segmentation masks that provide explicit anatomical structure knowledge, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that depend only on intensity similarity. Based on this, we propose a novel SAM-assisted registration framework incorporating prototype learning and contour awareness. The framework includes: (1) Explicit anatomical information injection, where SAM-generated segmentation masks are used as auxiliary inputs throughout training and testing to ensure the consistency of anatomical information; (2) Prototype learning, which leverages segmentation masks to extract prototype features and aligns prototypes to optimize semantic correspondences between images; and (3) Contour-aware loss, a contour-aware loss is designed that leverages the edges of segmentation masks to improve the model's performance in fine-grained deformation fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets, particularly in challenging scenarios with complex anatomical structures and ambiguous boundaries.

While significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from limitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a result, developing precise segmentation methods that require fewer labeled datasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the introduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for data-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is still needed and highly relevant. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that integrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans using text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our approach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the Multi-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for generating segmentation masks from SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also investigate using zero-shot segmentation labels within a weakly supervised paradigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive testing across four diverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high accuracy of our proposed framework.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) align with pre-trained vision encoders to enhance visual-language understanding, most existing methods rely on single-image analysis or rule-based heuristics to process multiple images, failing to fully leverage temporal information in multi-modal medical datasets. In this paper, we introduce Libra, a temporal-aware MLLM tailored for chest X-ray report generation. Libra combines a radiology-specific image encoder with a novel Temporal Alignment Connector (TAC), designed to accurately capture and integrate temporal differences between paired current and prior images. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate that Libra establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark among similarly scaled MLLMs, setting new standards in both clinical relevance and lexical accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 5 figures, Adding Appendix</p></details> | None |
| **[Optimizing CNN Architectures for Advanced Thoracic Disease Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10614v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis, especially for thoracic disease detection using chest X-ray images. In this study, we evaluate various CNN architectures, including binary classification, multi-label classification, and ResNet50 models, to address challenges like dataset imbalance, variations in image quality, and hidden biases. We introduce advanced preprocessing techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) for image compression and propose a novel class-weighted loss function to mitigate imbalance issues. Our results highlight the potential of CNNs in medical imaging but emphasize that issues like unbalanced datasets and variations in image acquisition methods must be addressed for optimal model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1) prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced to hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all tokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization. This highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. To exacerbate, existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens. On this front, we propose actionable strategies for different stakeholders to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Weakly-supervised learning, which allows less precise labels, has become a promising solution to this challenge. Building on this approach, we propose QMaxViT-Unet+, a novel framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation. This framework is built on the U-Net architecture, with the encoder and decoder replaced by Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) blocks. These blocks enhance the model's ability to learn local and global features efficiently. Additionally, our approach integrates a query-based Transformer decoder to refine features and an edge enhancement module to compensate for the limited boundary information in the scribble label. We evaluate the proposed QMaxViT-Unet+ on four public datasets focused on cardiac structures, colorectal polyps, and breast cancer: ACDC, MS-CMRSeg, SUN-SEG, and BUSI. Evaluation metrics include the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95). Experimental results show that QMaxViT-Unet+ achieves 89.1\% DSC and 1.316mm HD95 on ACDC, 88.4\% DSC and 2.226mm HD95 on MS-CMRSeg, 71.4\% DSC and 4.996mm HD95 on SUN-SEG, and 69.4\% DSC and 50.122mm HD95 on BUSI. These results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency while remaining competitive with fully-supervised learning approaches. This makes it ideal for medical image analysis, where high-quality annotations are often scarce and require significant effort and expense.

Although self-supervised learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, its application to classifying megakaryocytes in stained slides faces three main challenges: (1) pervasive background noise that obscures cellular details, (2) a long-tailed distribution that limits data for rare subtypes, and (3) complex morphological variations leading to high intra-class variability. To address these issues, we propose the ActiveSSF framework, which integrates active learning with self-supervised pretraining. Specifically, our approach employs Gaussian filtering combined with K-means clustering and HSV analysis (augmented by clinical prior knowledge) for accurate region-of-interest extraction; an adaptive sample selection mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds to mitigate class imbalance; and prototype clustering on labeled samples to overcome morphological complexity. Experimental results on clinical megakaryocyte datasets demonstrate that ActiveSSF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly improves recognition accuracy for rare subtypes. Moreover, the integration of these advanced techniques further underscores the practical potential of ActiveSSF in clinical settings. To foster further research, the code and datasets will be publicly released in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, submitted to EMBC 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite the remarkable progress achieved in medical image segmentation, there is still an absence of a 3D foundation segmentation model that can segment a wide range of anatomical categories with easy user interaction. In this paper, we propose a 3D foundation segmentation model, named SegVol, supporting universal and interactive volumetric medical image segmentation. By scaling up training data to 90K unlabeled Computed Tomography (CT) volumes and 6K labeled CT volumes, this foundation model supports the segmentation of over 200 anatomical categories using semantic and spatial prompts. To facilitate efficient and precise inference on volumetric images, we design a zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism. Extensive experiments on 22 anatomical segmentation tasks verify that SegVol outperforms the competitors in 19 tasks, with improvements up to 37.24% compared to the runner-up methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness and importance of specific designs by ablation study. We expect this foundation model can promote the development of volumetric medical image analysis.

| **[Prototype Contrastive Consistency Learning for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06650v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, but it can be very challenging especially when there are less labeled data but with large unlabeled data. Contrastive learning has proven to be effective for medical image segmentation in semi-supervised learning by constructing contrastive samples from partial pixels. However, although previous contrastive learning methods can mine semantic information from partial pixels within images, they ignore the whole context information of unlabeled images, which is very important to precise segmentation. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel prototype contrastive learning method called Prototype Contrastive Consistency Segmentation (PCCS) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The core idea is to enforce the prototypes of the same semantic class to be closer and push the prototypes in different semantic classes far away from each other. Specifically, we construct a signed distance map and an uncertainty map from unlabeled images. The signed distance map is used to construct prototypes for contrastive learning, and then we estimate the prototype uncertainty from the uncertainty map as trade-off among prototypes. In order to obtain better prototypes, based on the student-teacher architecture, a new mechanism named prototype updating prototype is designed to assist in updating the prototypes for contrastive learning. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-consistency loss to mine more reliable information from unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation demonstrate that PCCS achieves better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

By integrating a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism and refining the self-attention process, the model effectively extracts both global and local features, enhancing its ability to detect lesions with ambiguous boundaries and intricate structures. Performance evaluation on the ISIC 2017 dataset demonstrates that the improved Transformer surpasses established AI models, including ResNet50, VGG19, ResNext, and Vision Transformer, across key metrics such as accuracy, AUC, F1-Score, and Precision. Grad-CAM visualizations further highlight the interpretability of the model, showcasing strong alignment between the algorithm's focus areas and actual lesion sites.

| **[SACNet: A Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network for 2D Multi-organ Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10157v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-organ segmentation in medical image analysis is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many factors complicate the task, including variability in different target categories and interference from complex backgrounds. In this paper, we utilize the knowledge of Deformable Convolution V3 (DCNv3) and multi-object segmentation to optimize our Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network (SACNet) in three aspects: feature extraction, model architecture, and loss constraint, simultaneously enhancing the perception of different segmentation targets. Firstly, we propose the Adaptive Receptive Field Module (ARFM), which combines DCNv3 with a series of customized block-level and architecture-level designs similar to transformers. This module can capture the unique features of different organs by adaptively adjusting the receptive field according to various targets. Secondly, we utilize ARFM as building blocks to construct the encoder-decoder of SACNet and partially share parameters between the encoder and decoder, making the network wider rather than deeper. This design achieves a shared lightweight decoder and a more parameter-efficient and effective framework. Lastly, we propose a novel continuity dynamic adjustment loss function, based on t-vMF dice loss and cross-entropy loss, to better balance easy and complex classes in segmentation. Experiments on 3D slice datasets from ACDC and Synapse demonstrate that SACNet delivers superior segmentation performance in multi-organ segmentation tasks compared to several existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BIBM 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[L2GNet: Optimal Local-to-Global Representation of Anatomical Structures for Generalized Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05229v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous Latent Space (CLS) and Discrete Latent Space (DLS) models, like AttnUNet and VQUNet, have excelled in medical image segmentation. In contrast, Synergistic Continuous and Discrete Latent Space (CDLS) models show promise in handling fine and coarse-grained information. However, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. CLS or CDLS-based models, such as TransUNet or SynergyNet are adept at capturing long-range dependencies. Since they rely heavily on feature pooling or aggregation using self-attention, they may capture dependencies among redundant regions. This hinders comprehension of anatomical structure content, poses challenges in modeling intra-class and inter-class dependencies, increases false negatives and compromises generalization. Addressing these issues, we propose L2GNet, which learns global dependencies by relating discrete codes obtained from DLS using optimal transport and aligning codes on a trainable reference. L2GNet achieves discriminative on-the-fly representation learning without an additional weight matrix in self-attention models, making it computationally efficient for medical applications. Extensive experiments on multi-organ segmentation and cardiac datasets demonstrate L2GNet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, including the CDLS method SynergyNet, offering an novel approach to enhance deep learning models' performance in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the increasing use of generative models for synthetic data augmentation introduces potential risks, particularly in the absence of rigorous quality control. In this paper, we investigate the impact of synthetic MRI data on the robustness and segmentation accuracy of U-Net models for brain tumor segmentation. Specifically, we generate synthetic T1-contrast-enhanced (T1-Ce) MRI scans using a GAN-based model with a shared encoding-decoding framework and shortest-path regularization. To quantify the effect of synthetic data contamination, we train U-Net models on progressively "poisoned" datasets, where synthetic data proportions range from 16.67% to 83.33%. Experimental results on a real MRI validation set reveal a significant performance degradation as synthetic data increases, with Dice coefficients dropping from 0.8937 (33.33% synthetic) to 0.7474 (83.33% synthetic). Accuracy and sensitivity exhibit similar downward trends, demonstrating the detrimental effect of synthetic data on segmentation robustness. These findings underscore the importance of quality control in synthetic data integration and highlight the risks of unregulated synthetic augmentation in medical image analysis. Our study provides critical insights for the development of more reliable and trustworthy AI-driven medical imaging systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Commonly used smoothness regularizers for image registration fail to integrate population statistics, leading to anatomically inconsistent transformations. Inverse consistency regularizers promote geometric consistency but lack population morphometrics integration. Regularizers that constrain deformation to low-dimensional manifold methods address this. However, they prioritize reconstruction over interpretability and neglect diffeomorphic properties, such as group composition and inverse consistency. We introduce MORPH-LER, a Log-Euclidean regularization framework for population-aware unsupervised image registration. MORPH-LER learns population morphometrics from spatial transformations to guide and regularize registration networks, ensuring anatomically plausible deformations. It features a bottleneck autoencoder that computes the principal logarithm of deformation fields via iterative square-root predictions. It creates a linearized latent space that respects diffeomorphic properties and enforces inverse consistency. By integrating a registration network with a diffeomorphic autoencoder, MORPH-LER produces smooth, meaningful deformation fields. The framework offers two main contributions: (1) a data-driven regularization strategy that incorporates population-level anatomical statistics to enhance transformation validity and (2) a linearized latent space that enables compact and interpretable deformation fields for efficient population morphometrics analysis. We validate MORPH-LER across two families of deep learning-based registration networks, demonstrating its ability to produce anatomically accurate, computationally efficient, and statistically meaningful transformations on the OASIS-1 brain imaging dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

The ability to identify such concepts and their characteristics without supervision has the potential to improve pre-training methods, and enable novel applications such as fine-grained image retrieval and concept-based outlier detection. In this paper, we introduce ConceptVAE, a novel pre-training framework that detects and disentangles fine-grained concepts from their style characteristics in a self-supervised manner. We present a suite of loss terms and model architecture primitives designed to discretise input data into a preset number of concepts along with their local style. We validate ConceptVAE both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its ability to detect fine-grained anatomical structures such as blood pools and septum walls from 2D cardiac echocardiographies. Quantitatively, ConceptVAE outperforms traditional self-supervised methods in tasks such as region-based instance retrieval, semantic segmentation, out-of-distribution detection, and object detection. Additionally, we explore the generation of in-distribution synthetic data that maintains the same concepts as the training data but with distinct styles, highlighting its potential for more calibrated data generation. Overall, our study introduces and validates a promising new pre-training technique based on concept-style disentanglement, opening multiple avenues for developing models for medical image analysis that are more interpretable and explainable than black-box approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we introduce Distribution-aware Mixture of Experts (dMoE), inspired by optimal control theory. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its underlying mechanisms and clarify dMoE's role in adapting to heterogeneous distributions in medical image segmentation. Furthermore, we integrate dMoE into multiple network architectures, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse medical image analysis tasks. By incorporating demographic and clinical factors, dMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 2D benchmark datasets and a 3D in-house dataset.

While recent advancements in deep learning (DL), particularly CNNs, have shown promise, many models struggle with balancing accuracy and computational efficiency and often lack robustness across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture integrating separable convolutions and squeeze and excitation (SE) blocks, designed to enhance feature extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. Our model further incorporates batch normalization and dropout to prevent overfitting, ensuring stable and reliable performance. The proposed model is lightweight because it uses separable convolutions, which reduce the number of parameters, and incorporates global average pooling instead of fully connected layers to minimize computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Our model does better than other models by about 0.5% to 1.0% in accuracy and 1.5% to 2.5% in loss reduction, as shown by many experiments. It has a validation accuracy of 99.22% and a test accuracy of 98.44%. These results highlight the model's ability to generalize effectively across different brain tumour types, offering a robust tools for clinical applications.

However, the large scale of these datasets poses a challenge for researchers, resulting in increased storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and accessing them. Since different researchers have different use cases and require different resolutions or formats for DL, it is neither feasible to anticipate every researcher's needs nor practical to store data in multiple resolutions and formats. To that end, we propose the Medical Image Streaming Toolkit (MIST), a format-agnostic database that enables streaming of medical images at different resolutions and formats from a single high-resolution copy. We evaluated MIST across eight popular, large-scale medical imaging datasets spanning different body parts, modalities, and formats. Our results showed that our framework reduced the storage and bandwidth requirements for hosting and downloading datasets without impacting image quality. We demonstrate that MIST addresses the challenges posed by large-scale medical imaging datasets by building a data-efficient and format-agnostic database to meet the diverse needs of researchers and reduce barriers to DL research in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MIDL'25</p></details> | None |

This paper focuses on the application of a novel detection framework based on the RT-DETR model for analyzing intricate image data, particularly in areas such as diabetic retinopathy detection. Diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of vision loss globally, requires accurate and efficient image analysis to identify early-stage lesions. The proposed RT-DETR model, built on a Transformer-based architecture, excels at processing high-dimensional and complex visual data with enhanced robustness and accuracy. Comparative evaluations with models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv8, SSD, and DETR demonstrate that RT-DETR achieves superior performance across precision, recall, mAP50, and mAP50-95 metrics, particularly in detecting small-scale objects and densely packed targets.

| **[FedDAG: Federated Domain Adversarial Generation Towards Generalizable Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13967v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated domain generalization aims to train a global model from multiple source domains and ensure its generalization ability to unseen target domains. Due to the target domain being with unknown domain shifts, attempting to approximate these gaps by source domains may be the key to improving model generalization capability. Existing works mainly focus on sharing and recombining local domain-specific attributes to increase data diversity and simulate potential domain shifts. However, these methods may be insufficient since only the local attribute recombination can be hard to touch the out-of-distribution of global data. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-efficient framework named Federated Domain Adversarial Generation (FedDAG). It aims to simulate the domain shift and improve the model generalization by adversarially generating novel domains different from local and global source domains. Specifically, it generates novel-style images by maximizing the instance-level feature discrepancy between original and generated images and trains a generalizable task model by minimizing their feature discrepancy. Further, we observed that FedDAG could cause different performance improvements for local models. It may be due to inherent data isolation and heterogeneity among clients, exacerbating the imbalance in their generalization contributions to the global model. Ignoring this imbalance can lead the global model's generalization ability to be sub-optimal, further limiting the novel domain generation procedure. Thus, to mitigate this imbalance, FedDAG hierarchically aggregates local models at the within-client and across-client levels by using the sharpness concept to evaluate client model generalization contributions. Extensive experiments across four medical benchmarks demonstrate FedDAG's ability to enhance generalization in federated medical scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, advancements in deep learning have shown remarkable potential in medical image analysis. Methods In this study, we present "ViTranZheimer," an AD diagnosis approach which leverages video vision transformers to analyze 3D brain MRI data. By treating the 3D MRI volumes as videos, we exploit the temporal dependencies between slices to capture intricate structural relationships. The video vision transformer's self-attention mechanisms enable the model to learn long-range dependencies and identify subtle patterns that may indicate AD progression. Our proposed deep learning framework seeks to enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of AD diagnosis, empowering clinicians with a tool for early detection and intervention. We validate the performance of the video vision transformer using the ADNI dataset and conduct comparative analyses with other relevant models. Results The proposed ViTranZheimer model is compared with two hybrid models, CNN-BiLSTM and ViT-BiLSTM. CNN-BiLSTM is the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long-short-term memory network (BiLSTM), while ViT-BiLSTM is the combination of a vision transformer (ViT) with BiLSTM. The accuracy levels achieved in the ViTranZheimer, CNN-BiLSTM, and ViT-BiLSTM models are 98.6%, 96.479%, and 97.465%, respectively. ViTranZheimer demonstrated the highest accuracy at 98.6%, outperforming other models in this evaluation metric, indicating its superior performance in this specific evaluation metric.

Traditionally, precision and interpretability have been addressed as separate tasks, namely medical image analysis and explainable AI, each developing its own models independently. In this study, for the first time, we investigate the development of a unified medical vision-language pre-training model that can achieve both accurate analysis and interpretable understanding of medical images across various modalities. To build the model, we construct MedConcept-23M, a large-scale dataset comprising 23 million medical image-text pairs extracted from 6.2 million scientific articles, enriched with concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Based on MedConcept-23M, we introduce ConceptCLIP, a medical AI model utilizing concept-enhanced contrastive language-image pre-training. The pre-training of ConceptCLIP involves two primary components: image-text alignment learning (IT-Align) and patch-concept alignment learning (PC-Align). This dual alignment strategy enhances the model's capability to associate specific image regions with relevant concepts, thereby improving both the precision of analysis and the interpretability of the AI system. We conducted extensive experiments on 5 diverse types of medical image analysis tasks, spanning 51 subtasks across 10 image modalities, with the broadest range of downstream tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed vision-language pre-training model. Further explainability analysis across 6 modalities reveals that ConceptCLIP achieves superior performance, underscoring its robust ability to advance explainable AI in medical imaging. These findings highlight ConceptCLIP's capability in promoting trustworthy AI in the field of medicine.</p></details> |  | None |

While 3D volumes offer superior real-world applicability, they are less available for each modality and not easy to train in large scale, whereas 2D samples are abundant but less comprehensive. This paper introduces Cross-D Conv operation, a novel approach that bridges the dimensional gap by learning the phase shifting in the Fourier domain. Our method enables seamless weight transfer between 2D and 3D convolution operations, effectively facilitating cross-dimensional learning. The proposed architecture leverages the abundance of 2D training data to enhance 3D model performance, offering a practical solution to the multimodal data scarcity challenge in 3D medical model pretraining.

Despite the promising performance of existing methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they neglect useful equivariant properties for images, such as rotational and reflection equivariance. This limitation can decrease performance and lead to inconsistent predictions, especially in applications like vessel segmentation where explicit orientation is absent. While existing equivariant learning approaches attempt to mitigate these issues, they substantially increase learning cost, model size, or both. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel application of an efficient symmetric rotation-equivariant (SRE) convolutional (SRE-Conv) kernel implementation to the U-Net architecture, to learn rotation and reflection-equivariant features, while also reducing the model size dramatically. We validate the effectiveness of our method through improved segmentation performance on retina vessel fundus imaging.

Although some AI models only perform well with large amounts of data, we will move to data augmentation where there is a solution to improve the performance of our models and increase the dataset size through traditional or advanced techniques. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques on two different medical image datasets. In the first step, we applied some transformation techniques to the skin cancer dataset containing benign and malignant classes. Then, we trained the convolutional neural network (CNN) on the dataset before and after augmentation, which significantly improved test accuracy from 90.74% to 96.88% and decreased test loss from 0.7921 to 0.1468 after augmentation. In the second step, we used the Mixup technique by mixing two random images and their corresponding masks using the retina and blood vessels dataset, then we trained the U-net model and obtained the Dice coefficient which increased from 0 before augmentation to 0.4163 after augmentation. The result shows the effect of using data augmentation to increase the dataset size on the classification and segmentation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods are tailored to specific modalities and assume a particular resolution (often isotropic). This limits their generalizability in clinical settings, where variations in scan appearance arise from differences in sequence parameters, resolution, and orientation. Furthermore, most general-purpose models are designed for healthy subjects and suffer from performance degradation when pathology is present. We introduce UNA (Unraveling Normal Anatomy), the first modality-agnostic learning approach for normal brain anatomy reconstruction that can handle both healthy scans and cases with pathology. We propose a fluid-driven anomaly randomization method that generates an unlimited number of realistic pathology profiles on-the-fly. UNA is trained on a combination of synthetic and real data, and can be applied directly to real images with potential pathology without the need for fine-tuning. We demonstrate UNA's effectiveness in reconstructing healthy brain anatomy and showcase its direct application to anomaly detection, using both simulated and real images from 3D healthy and stroke datasets, including CT and MRI scans. By bridging the gap between healthy and diseased images, UNA enables the use of general-purpose models on diseased images, opening up new opportunities for large-scale analysis of uncurated clinical images in the presence of pathology.

We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods struggle to accurately characterize associations between images and diseases, leading to inaccurate or incomplete diagnostic results. In this work, we propose MedFILIP, a fine-grained VLP model, introduces medical image-specific knowledge through contrastive learning, specifically: 1) An information extractor based on a large language model is proposed to decouple comprehensive disease details from reports, which excels in extracting disease deals through flexible prompt engineering, thereby effectively reducing text complexity while retaining rich information at a tiny cost. 2) A knowledge injector is proposed to construct relationships between categories and visual attributes, which help the model to make judgments based on image features, and fosters knowledge extrapolation to unfamiliar disease categories. 3) A semantic similarity matrix based on fine-grained annotations is proposed, providing smoother, information-richer labels, thus allowing fine-grained image-text alignment. 4) We validate MedFILIP on numerous datasets, e.g., RSNA-Pneumonia, NIH ChestX-ray14, VinBigData, and COVID-19.

Although deterministic neural networks have shown promising results in this area, they provide only point estimates outputs yielding poor diagnostic in clinical decision-making. In this paper, we explore the use of Bayesian neural networks for classifying COVID-19 pneumonia in 3D CT scans providing uncertainties in their predictions. We compare deterministic networks and their Bayesian counterpart, enhancing the decision-making accuracy under uncertainty information. Remarkably, our findings reveal that lightweight architectures achieve the highest accuracy of 96\% after developing extensive hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the Bayesian counterpart of these architectures via Multiplied Normalizing Flow technique kept a similar performance along with calibrated uncertainty estimates. Finally, we have developed a 3D-visualization approach to explain the neural network outcomes based on SHAP values. We conclude that explainability along with uncertainty quantification will offer better clinical decisions in medical image analysis, contributing to ongoing efforts for improving the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 16 figures.

These models serve as a versatile base for a wide range of downstream tasks, including those in medicine and healthcare. FMs have demonstrated remarkable success across multiple healthcare domains. However, existing surveys in this field do not comprehensively cover all areas where FMs have made significant strides. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of FMs in medicine, focusing on their evolution, learning strategies, flagship models, applications, and associated challenges. We examine how prominent FMs, such as the BERT and GPT families, are transforming various aspects of healthcare, including clinical large language models, medical image analysis, and omics research. Additionally, we provide a detailed taxonomy of FM-enabled healthcare applications, spanning clinical natural language processing, medical computer vision, graph learning, and other biology- and omics- related tasks. Despite the transformative potentials of FMs, they also pose unique challenges. This survey delves into these challenges and highlights open research questions and lessons learned to guide researchers and practitioners. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into the capabilities of FMs in health, facilitating responsible deployment and mitigating associated risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review in IEEE REVIEWS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose Adaptive Vision-Language Fine-tuning with Hierarchical Contrastive Alignment (HiCA), a novel framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for medical image analysis. HiCA introduces a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, combining domain-specific pretraining and hierarchical contrastive learning to align visual and textual representations at multiple levels. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, Chest X-ray and Breast Ultrasound, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. Further analyses demonstrate the robustness, generalizability, and interpretability of our method, with substantial improvements in performance compared to existing baselines.

Although deep learning based methods have achieved promising performance, they are restricted to the use of binary segmentation mask. Inspired by the rigorous mapping between binary segmentation mask and distance map, we adopt distance map as a novel ground truth and employ a network to fulfill the computation of distance map. Specially, we propose a new segmentation framework that incorporates the existing binary segmentation network and a light weight regression network (dubbed as LR-Net). Thus, the LR-Net can convert the distance map computation into a regression task and leverage the rich information of distance maps. Additionally, we derive a shape-aware loss by employing distance maps as penalty map to infer the complete shape of an object. We evaluated our approach on MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge dataset and a clinical dataset. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the classification-based methods as well as other existing state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | Conference | None |

However, CNNs face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies while transformers suffer high computational complexities. To address this, we propose RWKV-UNet, a novel model that integrates the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) structure into the U-Net architecture. This integration enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and improve contextual understanding, which is crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. We build a strong encoder with developed inverted residual RWKV (IR-RWKV) blocks combining CNNs and RWKVs. We also propose a Cross-Channel Mix (CCM) module to improve skip connections with multi-scale feature fusion, achieving global channel information integration. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Synapse, ACDC, BUSI, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2017 and GLAS show that RWKV-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on various types of medical image segmentation. Additionally, smaller variants, RWKV-UNet-S and RWKV-UNet-T, balance accuracy and computational efficiency, making them suitable for broader clinical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Additionally, it often lacks sufficient labeled data for specific tasks requiring significant annotation effort. Continual Learning (CL) tackles adaptability and generalizability by enabling lifelong learning from a data stream while mitigating forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Active Learning (AL) reduces the number of required annotations for effective training. This work explores both approaches (CAL) to develop a novel framework for robust medical image analysis. Based on the automatic recognition of shifts in image characteristics, Replay-Base Architecture for Context Adaptation (RBACA) employs a CL rehearsal method to continually learn from diverse contexts, and an AL component to select the most informative instances for annotation. A novel approach to evaluate CAL methods is established using a defined metric denominated IL-Score, which allows for the simultaneous assessment of transfer learning, forgetting, and final model performance. We show that RBACA works in domain and class-incremental learning scenarios, by assessing its IL-Score on the segmentation and diagnosis of cardiac images. The results show that RBACA outperforms a baseline framework without CAL, and a state-of-the-art CAL method across various memory sizes and annotation budgets.

In skin cancer diagnosis, while advancements in lesion detection and classification have improved accuracy, the black-box nature of these methods poses challenges in understanding their decision processes, leading to trust issues among physicians. This study leverages the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model, trained on different skin lesion datasets, to capture meaningful relationships between visual features and diagnostic criteria terms. To further enhance transparency, we propose a method called MedGrad E-CLIP, which builds on gradient-based E-CLIP by incorporating a weighted entropy mechanism designed for complex medical imaging like skin lesions. This approach highlights critical image regions linked to specific diagnostic descriptions. The developed integrated pipeline not only classifies skin lesions by matching corresponding descriptions but also adds an essential layer of explainability developed especially for medical data. By visually explaining how different features in an image relates to diagnostic criteria, this approach demonstrates the potential of advanced vision-language models in medical image analysis, ultimately improving transparency, robustness, and trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW)</p></details> | None |

Despite the progress has been achieved, current FSMIS models are all trained and deployed on the same data domain, as is not consistent with the clinical reality that medical imaging data is always across different data domains (e.g. imaging modalities, institutions and equipment sequences). How to enhance the FSMIS models to generalize well across the different specific medical imaging domains? In this paper, we focus on the matching mechanism of the few-shot semantic segmentation models and introduce an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) calculation based domain robust matching mechanism for the cross-domain scenario. Specifically, we formulate the EMD transportation process between the foreground support-query features, the texture structure aware weights generation method, which proposes to perform the sobel based image gradient calculation over the nodes, is introduced in the EMD matching flow to restrain the domain relevant nodes. Besides, the point set level distance measurement metric is introduced to calculated the cost for the transportation from support set nodes to query set nodes. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on three scenarios (i.e., cross-modal, cross-sequence and cross-institution), which includes eight medical datasets and involves three body regions, and the results demonstrate that our model achieves the SoTA performance against the compared models.</p></details> |  | None |

While classical methods are accurate, they are computationally demanding, and deep neural networks, though efficient, have been underexplored for nonrigid dMRI registration compared to structural imaging. We present a novel, deep learning framework for model-free, nonrigid registration of raw diffusion MRI data that does not require explicit reorientation. Unlike previous methods relying on derived representations such as diffusion tensors or fiber orientation distribution functions, in our approach, we formulate the registration as an equivariant diffeomorphism of position-and-orientation space. Central to our method is an $\mathsf{SE}(3)$-equivariant UNet that generates velocity fields while preserving the geometric properties of a raw dMRI's domain. We introduce a new loss function based on the maximum mean discrepancy in Fourier space, implicitly matching ensemble average propagators across images. Experimental results on Human Connectome Project dMRI data demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with the added advantage of bypassing the overhead for estimating derived representations. This work establishes a foundation for data-driven, geometry-aware dMRI registration directly in the acquisition space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Coaut...</summary><p>Coauthor was inadvertently left out.

Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) for feature pre-training can further unleash the potential of ViT on various medical vision tasks. However, due to large spatial sizes with much higher dimensions of 3D medical images, the lack of hierarchical design for MAE may hinder the performance of downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{Mask in Mask (MiM)} pre-training framework for 3D medical images, which aims to advance MAE by learning discriminative representation from hierarchical visual tokens across varying scales. We introduce multiple levels of granularity for masked inputs from the volume, which are then reconstructed simultaneously ranging at both fine and coarse levels. Additionally, a cross-level alignment mechanism is applied to adjacent level volumes to enforce anatomical similarity hierarchically. Furthermore, we adopt a hybrid backbone to enhance the hierarchical representation learning efficiently during the pre-training. MiM was pre-trained on a large scale of available 3D volumetric images, \textit{i.e.,} Computed Tomography (CT) images containing various body parts. Extensive experiments on thirteen public datasets demonstrate the superiority of MiM over other SSL methods in organ/lesion/tumor segmentation and disease classification. We further scale up the MiM to large pre-training datasets with more than 10k volumes, showing that large-scale pre-training can further enhance the performance of downstream tasks. The improvement also concluded that the research community should pay more attention to the scale of the pre-training dataset towards the healthcare foundation model for 3D medical images.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to a journal, updated v2</p></details> | None |

However, ViTs often struggle to model local spatial information effectively, which is essential for accurately segmenting fine anatomical details, particularly when applied to small datasets without extensive pre-training. We introduce Gabor and Laplacian of Gaussian Convolutional Swin Network (GLoG-CSUnet), a novel architecture enhancing Transformer-based models by incorporating learnable radiomic features. This approach integrates dynamically adaptive Gabor and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters to capture texture, edge, and boundary information, enhancing the feature representation processed by the Transformer model. Our method uniquely combines the long-range dependency modeling of Transformers with the texture analysis capabilities of Gabor and LoG features. Evaluated on the Synapse multi-organ and ACDC cardiac segmentation datasets, GLoG-CSUnet demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models, achieving a 1.14% increase in Dice score for Synapse and 0.99% for ACDC, with minimal computational overhead (only 15 and 30 additional parameters, respectively). GLoG-CSUnet's flexible design allows integration with various base models, offering a promising approach for incorporating radiomics-inspired feature extraction in Transformer architectures for medical image analysis.

Significant progress has been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, but most require much labeled data for training. Consequently, developing precise segmentation methods that demand fewer labeled datasets is paramount in medical image analysis. The emergence of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, recently opened the door for universal computer vision tasks. Exploiting the generalization ability of these pre-trained foundation models on downstream tasks, such as segmentation, leads to unexpected performance with a relatively small amount of labeled data. However, exploring these models for pulmonary artery-vein segmentation is still limited. This paper proposes a novel framework called Language-guided self-adaptive Cross-Attention Fusion Framework. Our method adopts pre-trained CLIP as a strong feature extractor for generating the segmentation of 3D CT scans, while adaptively aggregating the cross-modality of text and image representations. We propose a s pecially designed adapter module to fine-tune pre-trained CLIP with a self-adaptive learning strategy to effectively fuse the two modalities of embeddings. We extensively validate our method on a local dataset, which is the largest pulmonary artery-vein CT dataset to date and consists of 718 labeled data in total. The experiments show that our method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our data and code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages,3 figures | None |

However, conventional FL methods typically necessitate multiple communication rounds, leading to significant communication overhead and delays, especially in environments with limited bandwidth. One-shot federated learning addresses these issues by conducting model training and aggregation in a single communication round, thereby reducing communication costs while preserving privacy. Among these, one-shot federated ensemble learning combines independently trained client models using ensemble techniques such as voting, further boosting performance in non-IID data scenarios. On the other hand, existing machine learning methods in healthcare predominantly use unimodal data (e.g., medical images or textual reports), which restricts their diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness. Therefore, the integration of multi-modal data is proposed to address these shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce FedMME, an innovative one-shot multi-modal federated ensemble learning framework that utilizes multi-modal data for medical image analysis. Specifically, FedMME capitalizes on vision large language models to produce textual reports from medical images, employs a BERT model to extract textual features from these reports, and amalgamates these features with visual features to improve diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that our method demonstrated superior performance compared to existing one-shot federated learning methods in healthcare scenarios across four datasets with various data distributions. For instance, it surpasses existing one-shot federated learning approaches by more than 17.5% in accuracy on the RSNA dataset when applying a Dirichlet distribution with ($\alpha$ = 0.3).</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional CNN-based methods struggle with modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based models, despite their success, suffer from quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose KM-UNet, a novel U-shaped network architecture that combines the strengths of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and state-space models (SSMs). KM-UNet leverages the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for efficient feature representation and SSMs for scalable long-range modeling, achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

While human expertise remains foundational to medical practice, AI-powered tools are increasingly matching or exceeding specialist-level performance across multiple domains, paving the way for a new era of democratized healthcare access. These systems promise to reduce disparities in care delivery across demographic, racial, and socioeconomic boundaries by providing high-quality diagnostic support at scale. As a result, advanced healthcare services can be affordable to all populations, irrespective of demographics, race, or socioeconomic background. The democratization of such AI tools can reduce the cost of care, optimize resource allocation, and improve the quality of care. In contrast to humans, AI can potentially uncover complex relationships in the data from a large set of inputs and lead to new evidence-based knowledge in medicine. However, integrating AI into healthcare raises several ethical and philosophical concerns, such as bias, transparency, autonomy, responsibility, and accountability. In this study, we examine recent advances in AI-enabled medical image analysis, current regulatory frameworks, and emerging best practices for clinical integration. We analyze both technical and ethical challenges inherent in deploying AI systems across healthcare institutions, with particular attention to data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and system transparency. Furthermore, we propose practical solutions to address key challenges, including data scarcity, racial bias in training datasets, limited model interpretability, and systematic algorithmic biases. Finally, we outline a conceptual algorithm for responsible AI implementations and identify promising future research and development directions.</p></details> | Submitted to MDPI | None |
| **[Hierarchical Salient Patch Identification for Interpretable Fundus Disease Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14334v3)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of deep learning technology in medical image analysis, the effective explanation of model predictions and improvement of diagnostic accuracy have become urgent problems that need to be solved. Attribution methods have become key tools to help doctors better understand the diagnostic basis of models, and are used to explain and localize diseases in medical images. However, previous methods suffer from inaccurate and incomplete localization problems for fundus diseases with complex and diverse structures. To solve these problems, we propose a weakly supervised interpretable fundus disease localization method called hierarchical salient patch identification (HSPI) that can achieve interpretable disease localization using only image-level labels and a neural network classifier (NNC). First, we propose salient patch identification (SPI), which divides the image into several patches and optimizes consistency loss to identify which patch in the input image is most important for the network's prediction, in order to locate the disease. Second, we propose a hierarchical identification strategy to force SPI to analyze the importance of different areas to neural network classifier's prediction to comprehensively locate disease areas. Conditional peak focusing is then introduced to ensure that the mask vector can accurately locate the disease area. Finally, we propose patch selection based on multi-sized intersections to filter out incorrectly or additionally identified non-disease regions. We conduct disease localization experiments on fundus image datasets and achieve the best performance on multiple evaluation metrics compared to previous interpretable attribution methods. Additional ablation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of each method.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their successes, deep learning models often struggle to accurately capture the connectivity and continuity of fine, sometimes pixel-thin, yet critical structures due to their reliance on implicit learning from data. Such shortcomings can significantly impact the reliability of analysis results and hinder clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, we introduce Conformable Convolution, a novel convolutional layer designed to explicitly enforce topological consistency. Conformable Convolution learns adaptive kernel offsets that preferentially focus on regions of high topological significance within an image. This prioritization is guided by our proposed Topological Posterior Generator (TPG) module, which leverages persistent homology. The TPG module identifies key topological features and guides the convolutional layers by applying persistent homology to feature maps transformed into cubical complexes. Our proposed modules are architecture-agnostic, enabling them to be integrated seamlessly into various architectures. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in the segmentation task, where preserving the interconnectedness of structures is critical. Experimental results on three diverse datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively preserves the topology in the segmentation downstream task, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  | None |

The experimental results show that VGG19 performs well in multiple indicators such as accuracy (92%), AUC (0.95), F1 score (0.90) and recall rate (0.87), which is better than other comparison models, especially in image feature extraction and classification accuracy. Although ResNet50 performs well in some indicators, it is slightly inferior to VGG19 in recall rate and F1 score. Traditional machine learning models SVM and XGBoost are obviously limited in image classification tasks, especially in complex medical image analysis tasks, and their performance is relatively mediocre. The research results show that deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks, have significant advantages in medical image classification tasks, especially in pneumonia X-ray image analysis, and can provide efficient and accurate automatic diagnosis support. This research provides strong technical support for the early detection of pneumonia and the development of automated diagnosis systems and also lays the foundation for further promoting the application and development of automated medical image processing technology.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these issues, existing studies typically employ semi-supervised segmentation techniques using pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization. However, these methods mainly rely on individual data samples for training, ignoring the rich neighborhood information present in the feature space. In this work, we argue that supervisory information can be directly extracted from the geometry of the feature space. Inspired by the density-based clustering hypothesis, we propose using feature density to locate sparse regions within feature clusters. Our goal is to increase intra-class compactness by addressing sparsity issues. To achieve this, we propose a Density-Aware Contrastive Learning (DACL) strategy, pushing anchored features in sparse regions towards cluster centers approximated by high-density positive samples, resulting in more compact clusters. Specifically, our method constructs density-aware neighbor graphs using labeled and unlabeled data samples to estimate feature density and locate sparse regions. We also combine label-guided co-training with density-guided geometric regularization to form complementary supervision for unlabeled data. Experiments on the Multi-Organ Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its efficacy in medical image segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, data owned by each institution would be highly heterogeneous and the distribution is always non-independent and identical distribution (non-IID), resulting in client drift and unsatisfactory performance. Despite existing federated learning methods attempting to solve the non-IID problems, they still show marginal advantages but rely on frequent communication which would incur high costs and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning method: \textbf{Fed}erated learning via \textbf{V}aluable \textbf{C}ondensed \textbf{K}nowledge (FedVCK). We enhance the quality of condensed knowledge and select the most necessary knowledge guided by models, to tackle the non-IID problem within limited communication budgets effectively. Specifically, on the client side, we condense the knowledge of each client into a small dataset and further enhance the condensation procedure with latent distribution constraints, facilitating the effective capture of high-quality knowledge. During each round, we specifically target and condense knowledge that has not been assimilated by the current model, thereby preventing unnecessary repetition of homogeneous knowledge and minimizing the frequency of communications required. On the server side, we propose relational supervised contrastive learning to provide more supervision signals to aid the global model updating. Comprehensive experiments across various medical tasks show that FedVCK can outperform state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that it's non-IID robust and communication-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Advancing Deformable Medical Image Registration with Multi-axis Cross-covariance Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18545v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable image registration is a fundamental requirement for medical image analysis. Recently, transformers have been widely used in deep learning-based registration methods for their ability to capture long-range dependency via self-attention (SA). However, the high computation and memory loads of SA (growing quadratically with the spatial resolution) hinder transformers from processing subtle textural information in high-resolution image features, e.g., at the full and half image resolutions. This limits deformable registration as the high-resolution textural information is crucial for finding precise pixel-wise correspondence between subtle anatomical structures. Cross-covariance Attention (XCA), as a "transposed" version of SA that operates across feature channels, has complexity growing linearly with the spatial resolution, providing the feasibility of capturing long-range dependency among high-resolution image features. However, existing XCA-based transformers merely capture coarse global long-range dependency, which are unsuitable for deformable image registration relying primarily on fine-grained local correspondence. In this study, we propose to improve existing deep learning-based registration methods by embedding a new XCA mechanism. To this end, we design an XCA-based transformer block optimized for deformable medical image registration, named Multi-Axis XCA (MAXCA). Our MAXCA serves as a general network block that can be embedded into various registration network architectures. It can capture both global and local long-range dependency among high-resolution image features by applying regional and dilated XCA in parallel via a multi-axis design. Extensive experiments on two well-benchmarked inter-/intra-patient registration tasks with seven public medical datasets demonstrate that our MAXCA block enables state-of-the-art registration performance.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[Concept Complement Bottleneck Model for Interpretable Medical Image Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15446v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models based on human-understandable concepts have received extensive attention to improve model interpretability for trustworthy artificial intelligence in the field of medical image analysis. These methods can provide convincing explanations for model decisions but heavily rely on the detailed annotation of pre-defined concepts. Consequently, they may not be effective in cases where concepts or annotations are incomplete or low-quality. Although some methods automatically discover effective and new visual concepts rather than using pre-defined concepts or could find some human-understandable concepts via large Language models, they are prone to veering away from medical diagnostic evidence and are challenging to understand. In this paper, we propose a concept complement bottleneck model for interpretable medical image diagnosis with the aim of complementing the existing concept set and finding new concepts bridging the gap between explainable models. Specifically, we propose to use concept adapters for specific concepts to mine the concept differences and score concepts in their own attention channels to support almost fairly concept learning. Then, we devise a concept complement strategy to learn new concepts while jointly using known concepts to improve model performance. Comprehensive experiments on medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in concept detection and disease diagnosis tasks while providing diverse explanations to ensure model interpretability effectively.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures, | None |

Computational techniques in medicine enhance the diagnosis and treatment efficiency. However, many computational techniques, particularly those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), require high resources and time for training, highlighting the research opportunities in methods with low computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach combining conventional classifiers, segmented images, and CNNs for the automated classification of sickle cell disease. We evaluated the impact of segmented images on classification, providing insight into deep learning integration. Our results demonstrate that using segmented images and CNN features with an SVM achieves an accuracy of 96.80%. This finding is relevant for computationally efficient scenarios, paving the way for future research and advancements in medical-image analysis.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |
| **[Enhancing Reconstruction-Based Out-of-Distribution Detection in Brain MRI with Model and Metric Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17586v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for safely deploying automated medical image analysis systems, as abnormal patterns in images could hamper their performance. However, OOD detection in medical imaging remains an open challenge, and we address three gaps: the underexplored potential of a simple OOD detection model, the lack of optimization of deep learning strategies specifically for OOD detection, and the selection of appropriate reconstruction metrics. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a reconstruction-based autoencoder for unsupervised detection of synthetic artifacts in brain MRI. We evaluated the general reconstruction capability of the model, analyzed the impact of the selected training epoch and reconstruction metrics, assessed the potential of model and/or metric ensembles, and tested the model on a dataset containing a diverse range of artifacts. Among the metrics assessed, the contrast component of SSIM and LPIPS consistently outperformed others in detecting homogeneous circular anomalies. By combining two well-converged models and using LPIPS and contrast as reconstruction metrics, we achieved a pixel-level area under the Precision-Recall curve of 0.66. Furthermore, with the more realistic OOD dataset, we observed that the detection performance varied between artifact types; local artifacts were more difficult to detect, while global artifacts showed better detection results. These findings underscore the importance of carefully selecting metrics and model configurations, and highlight the need for tailored approaches, as standard deep learning approaches do not always align with the unique needs of OOD detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Diffusion models, a recent generative modeling technique, offer a potential solution by generating synthetic and realistic data. However, questions remain about the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on original and synthetic datasets. If diffusion-generated samples can help CNN models perform comparably to those trained on original datasets, reliance on patient-specific data for training CNNs might be reduced. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of diffusion models for generating synthetic medical images to train CNNs in three domains: Brain Tumor MRI, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), and SARS-CoV-2 CT scans. A diffusion model was trained to generate synthetic datasets for each domain. Pre-trained CNN architectures were then trained on these synthetic datasets and evaluated on unseen real data. All three datasets achieved promising classification performance using CNNs trained on synthetic data. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) analysis revealed that the models focused on relevant image features for classification. This study demonstrates the potential of diffusion models to generate synthetic medical images for training CNNs in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

This study proposes a two-stage framework that decouples classification and grounding to address the inherent challenges posed by traditional Multi-Task Learning models, which jointly optimizes classification and segmentation. Our approach separates these tasks to achieve targeted optimization for each. The model first classifies images as bleeding or non-bleeding, thereby isolating subsequent grounding from inter-task interference and label heterogeneity. To further enhance performance, we incorporate Stochastic Weight Averaging and Test-Time Augmentation, which improve model robustness against domain shifts and annotation inconsistencies. Our method is validated on the Auto-WCEBleedGen Challenge V2 Challenge dataset and achieving second place. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and segmentation precision, especially on sequential datasets with consistent visual patterns. This study highlights the practical benefits of a two-stage strategy for medical image analysis and sets a new standard for GI bleeding detection and segmentation.

While Japan leads globally in CT scanner deployment and utilization, the lack of large-scale Japanese radiology datasets has hindered the development of specialized language models for medical imaging analysis. Objective: To develop a comprehensive Japanese CT report dataset through machine translation and establish a specialized language model for structured finding classification. Additionally, to create a rigorously validated evaluation dataset through expert radiologist review. Methods: We translated the CT-RATE dataset (24,283 CT reports from 21,304 patients) into Japanese using GPT-4o mini. The training dataset consisted of 22,778 machine-translated reports, while the validation dataset included 150 radiologist-revised reports. We developed CT-BERT-JPN based on "tohoku-nlp/bert-base-japanese-v3" architecture for extracting 18 structured findings from Japanese radiology reports. Results: Translation metrics showed strong performance with BLEU scores of 0.731 and 0.690, and ROUGE scores ranging from 0.770 to 0.876 for Findings and from 0.748 to 0.857 for Impression sections. CT-BERT-JPN demonstrated superior performance compared to GPT-4o in 11 out of 18 conditions, including lymphadenopathy (+14.2%), interlobular septal thickening (+10.9%), and atelectasis (+7.4%). The model maintained F1 scores exceeding 0.95 in 14 out of 18 conditions and achieved perfect scores in four conditions. Conclusions: Our study establishes a robust Japanese CT report dataset and demonstrates the effectiveness of a specialized language model for structured finding classification. The hybrid approach of machine translation and expert validation enables the creation of large-scale medical datasets while maintaining high quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/YYama0/CT-RATE-JPN</p></details> | None |

Addressing this performance gap is important to fully leverage the pre-trained weights of SAMs, particularly in the domain of volumetric medical image segmentation, where accuracy is important but well-annotated 3D medical data for fine-tuning is limited. In this work, we investigate whether introducing the memory mechanism as a plug-in, specifically the ability to memorize and recall internal representations of past inputs, can improve the performance of SAM with limited computation cost. To this end, we propose Memorizing SAM, a novel 3D SAM architecture incorporating a memory Transformer as a plug-in. Unlike conventional memorizing Transformers that save the internal representation during training or inference, our Memorizing SAM utilizes existing highly accurate internal representation as the memory source to ensure the quality of memory. We evaluate the performance of Memorizing SAM in 33 categories from the TotalSegmentator dataset, which indicates that Memorizing SAM can outperform state-of-the-art 3D SAM variant i.e., FastSAM3D with an average Dice increase of 11.36% at the cost of only 4.38 millisecond increase in inference time.

| **[Language-guided Medical Image Segmentation with Target-informed Multi-level Contrastive Alignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13533v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is crucial in modern medical image analysis, which can aid into diagnosis of various disease conditions. Recently, language-guided segmentation methods have shown promising results in automating image segmentation where text reports are incorporated as guidance. These text reports, containing image impressions and insights given by clinicians, provides auxiliary guidance. However, these methods neglect the inherent pattern gaps between the two distinct modalities, which leads to sub-optimal image-text feature fusion without proper cross-modality feature alignments. Contrastive alignments are widely used to associate image-text semantics in representation learning; however, it has not been exploited to bridge the pattern gaps in language-guided segmentation that relies on subtle low level image details to represent diseases. Existing contrastive alignment methods typically algin high-level global image semantics without involving low-level, localized target information, and therefore fails to explore fine-grained text guidance for language-guided segmentation. In this study, we propose a language-guided segmentation network with Target-informed Multi-level Contrastive Alignments (TMCA). TMCA enables target-informed cross-modality alignments and fine-grained text guidance to bridge the pattern gaps in language-guided segmentation. Specifically, we introduce: 1) a target-sensitive semantic distance module that enables granular image-text alignment modelling, and 2) a multi-level alignment strategy that directs text guidance on low-level image features. In addition, a language-guided target enhancement module is proposed to leverage the aligned text to redirect attention to focus on critical localized image features. Extensive experiments on 4 image-text datasets, involving 3 medical imaging modalities, demonstrated that our TMCA achieved superior performances.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving High Performance Medical Image Classification through Training-Free Embedding Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09445v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models for medical imaging typically involves extensive training and testing on large datasets, consuming significant computational time, energy, and resources. There is a need for more efficient methods that can achieve comparable or superior diagnostic performance without the associated resource burden. We investigated the feasibility of replacing conventional training procedures with an embedding-based approach that leverages concise and semantically meaningful representations of medical images. Using pre-trained foundational models-specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) like ResNet and multimodal models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-we generated image embeddings for multi-class classification tasks. Simple linear classifiers were then applied to these embeddings. The approach was evaluated across diverse medical imaging modalities, including retinal images, mammography, dermatoscopic images, and chest radiographs. Performance was compared to benchmark models trained and tested using traditional methods. The embedding-based models surpassed the benchmark area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) scores by up to 87 percentage in multi-class classification tasks across the various medical imaging modalities. Notably, CLIP embedding models achieved the highest AUC-ROC scores, demonstrating superior classification performance while significantly reducing computational demands. Our study indicates that leveraging embeddings from pre-trained foundational models can effectively replace conventional, resource-intensive training and testing procedures in medical image analysis. This embedding-based approach offers a more efficient alternative for image segmentation, classification, and prediction, potentially accelerating AI technology integration into clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Despite these successes, research suffers from knowledge silos, hindering collaboration and progress: Existing knowledge is scattered across publications and many details remain unpublished, while privacy regulations restrict data sharing. In the spirit of democratizing of AI, we propose a framework for secure knowledge transfer in the field of medical image analysis. The key to our approach is dataset "fingerprints", structured representations of feature distributions, that enable quantification of task similarity. We tested our approach across 71 distinct tasks and 12 medical imaging modalities by transferring neural architectures, pretraining, augmentation policies, and multi-task learning. According to comprehensive analyses, our method outperforms traditional methods for identifying relevant knowledge and facilitates collaborative model training. Our framework fosters the democratization of AI in medical imaging and could become a valuable tool for promoting faster scientific advancement.</p></details> |  | None |

This capability is crucial for applications in areas such as robotics, medical image analysis, and manufacturing. In this paper, we first introduce Geoperception, a benchmark designed to evaluate an MLLM's ability to accurately transcribe 2D geometric information from an image. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate the limitations of leading MLLMs, and then conduct a comprehensive empirical study to explore strategies for improving their performance on geometric tasks. Our findings highlight the benefits of certain model architectures, training techniques, and data strategies, including the use of high-fidelity synthetic data and multi-stage training with a data curriculum. Notably, we find that a data curriculum enables models to learn challenging geometry understanding tasks which they fail to learn from scratch. Leveraging these insights, we develop Euclid, a family of models specifically optimized for strong low-level geometric perception. Although purely trained on synthetic multimodal data, Euclid shows strong generalization ability to novel geometry shapes. For instance, Euclid outperforms the best closed-source model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, by up to 58.56% on certain Geoperception benchmark tasks and 10.65% on average across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 22 figures, 5 tables, 7 algorithms</p></details> | None |

However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large GIE dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring patient integrity across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical image diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the ViT architecture and trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Our model demonstrates robust performance, securing third place in the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge. We achieved a macro AUC of 0.762 and a balanced accuracy of 37.1% on the test set. These results emphasize the effectiveness of our domain-adaptive pre-training approach and the enriched EndoExtend24 dataset in advancing gastrointestinal endoscopy diagnostics.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods require post-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize small yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we introduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap generation as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps, INSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture fine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress local false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically relevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art classification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation performance.

However, the scarcity of labeled data and limited generalization capabilities hinder the advancement of AI-empowered models. Radiology reports are easily accessible and can serve as weakly-supervised signals. However, large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) remains underexplored in 3D medical image analysis. Specifically, the insufficient investigation into multi-grained radiology semantics and their correlations across patients leads to underutilization of large-scale volume-report data. Considering intra-patient cross-modal semantic consistency and inter-patient semantic correlations, we propose a multi-task VLP method, MG-3D, pre-trained on large-scale data (47.1K), addressing the challenges by the following two aspects: 1) Establishing the correspondence between volume semantics and multi-grained medical knowledge of each patient with cross-modal global alignment and complementary modality-guided local reconstruction, ensuring intra-patient features of different modalities cohesively represent the same semantic content; 2) Correlating inter-patient visual semantics based on fine-grained report correlations across patients, and keeping sensitivity to global individual differences via contrastive learning, enhancing the discriminative feature representation. Furthermore, we delve into the scaling law to explore potential performance improvements. Comprehensive evaluations across nine uni- and cross-modal clinical tasks are carried out to assess model efficacy. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superior transferability, scalability, and generalization of MG-3D, showcasing its potential in advancing feature representation for 3D medical image analysis.

However, it also affected our ability to explain and validate model decisions. Models can use non-relevant parts of images, also called spurious correlations or shortcuts, to obtain high performance on benchmark datasets but fail in real-world scenarios. In this work, we challenge the capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify chest X-rays and eye fundus images while masking out clinically relevant parts of the image. We show that all models trained on the PadChest dataset, irrespective of the masking strategy, are able to obtain an Area Under the Curve (AUC) above random. Moreover, the models trained on full images obtain good performance on images without the region of interest (ROI), even superior to the one obtained on images only containing the ROI. We also reveal a possible spurious correlation in the Chaksu dataset while the performances are more aligned with the expectation of an unbiased model. We go beyond the performance analysis with the usage of the explainability method SHAP and the analysis of embeddings. We asked a radiology resident to interpret chest X-rays under different masking to complement our findings with clinical knowledge.

However, deploying DL models for MedIA in real-world situations remains challenging due to their failure to generalize across the distributional gap between training and testing samples - a problem known as domain shift. Researchers have dedicated their efforts to developing various DL methods to adapt and perform robustly on unknown and out-of-distribution (OOD) data distributions. This article comprehensively reviews domain generalization (DG) studies specifically tailored for MedIA. We provide a holistic view of how DG techniques interact within the broader MedIA system, going beyond methodologies to consider the operational implications on the entire MedIA workflow. Specifically, we categorize DG methods into data-level, feature-level, model-level, and analysis-level methods. We show how those methods can be used in various stages of the MedIA workflow with DL equipped from data acquisition to model prediction and analysis. Furthermore, we critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various methods, unveiling future research opportunities.</p></details> |  | None |

This has left a gap in addressing the threat to classifiers' open-set performance, referred to as outlier detection in the literature. Reliable outlier detection is crucial for deploying classifiers in critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. First, we show that existing backdoor attacks fall short in affecting the open-set performance of classifiers, as they have been specifically designed to confuse intra-closed-set decision boundaries. In contrast, an effective backdoor attack for outlier detection needs to confuse the decision boundary between the closed and open sets. Motivated by this, in this study, we propose BATOD, a novel Backdoor Attack targeting the Outlier Detection task. Specifically, we design two categories of triggers to shift inlier samples to outliers and vice versa. We evaluate BATOD using various real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior ability to degrade the open-set performance of classifiers compared to previous attacks, both before and after applying defenses.</p></details> |  | None |

To mitigate this, we present a causal modeling framework, which aims to reduce the impact of sensitive attributes on diagnostic predictions. Our approach introduces a novel fairness criterion, \textbf{Diagnosis Fairness}, and a unique fairness metric, leveraging path-specific fairness to control the influence of demographic attributes, ensuring that predictions are primarily informed by clinically relevant features rather than sensitive attributes. By incorporating adversarial perturbation masks, our framework directs the model to focus on critical image regions, suppressing bias-inducing information. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces bias directly associated with sensitive attributes while preserving diagnostic accuracy. Our findings suggest that causal modeling can enhance both fairness and interpretability in AI-powered clinical decision support systems.</p></details> |  | None |

These large-scale resources have been used to train progressively larger models which are resource intensive in terms of compute, data, energy, and carbon emissions. These costs are becoming a new type of entry barrier to researchers and practitioners with limited access to resources at such scale, particularly in the Global South. In this work, we take a comprehensive look at the landscape of existing DL models for medical image analysis tasks and demonstrate their usefulness in settings where resources are limited. To account for the resource consumption of DL models, we introduce a novel measure to estimate the performance per resource unit, which we call the PePR score. Using a diverse family of 131 unique DL architectures (spanning 1M to 130M trainable parameters) and three medical image datasets, we capture trends about the performance-resource trade-offs. In applications like medical image analysis, we argue that small-scale, specialized models are better than striving for large-scale models. Furthermore, we show that using existing pretrained models that are fine-tuned on new data can significantly reduce the computational resources and data required compared to training models from scratch. We hope this work will encourage the community to focus on improving AI equity by developing methods and models with smaller resource footprints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published at the Northern Lights Deep Learning Conference (NLDL), 2025.

However, AI-based methods also raise serious privacy concerns, as medical images often contain highly sensitive patient information. This review offers a comprehensive overview of privacy-preserving techniques in medical image analysis, including encryption, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and generative adversarial networks.

| **[Intuitive Axial Augmentation Using Polar-Sine-Based Piecewise Distortion for Medical Slice-Wise Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03352v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most data-driven models for medical image analysis rely on universal augmentations to improve performance. Experimental evidence has confirmed their effectiveness, but the unclear mechanism underlying them poses a barrier to the widespread acceptance and trust in such methods within the medical community. We revisit and acknowledge the unique characteristics of medical images apart from traditional digital images, and consequently, proposed a medical-specific augmentation algorithm that is more elastic and aligns well with radiology scan procedure. The method performs piecewise affine with sinusoidal distorted ray according to radius on polar coordinates, thus simulating uncertain postures of human lying flat on the scanning table. Our method could generate human visceral distribution without affecting the fundamental relative position on axial plane. Two non-adaptive algorithms, namely Meta-based Scan Table Removal and Similarity-Guided Parameter Search, are introduced to bolster robustness of our augmentation method. Experiments show our method improves accuracy across multiple famous segmentation frameworks without requiring more data samples.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to adapt foundation models to new domains by updating only a small portion of parameters in order to reduce computational overhead. However, the effectiveness of these PEFT methods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image analysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of the performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate the limitations of prompt introducing ways and approximation capabilities on Transformer architectures of mainstream prompt tuning methods, we propose the Embedded Prompt Tuning (EPT) method by embedding prompt tokens into the expanded channels. We also find that there are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models during pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative impact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to understand prompt tuning: Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator. And we support it by analyzing patch-wise scaling and feature separation operations contained in EPT. Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot medical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process within highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method.

| **[RaD: A Metric for Medical Image Distribution Comparison in Out-of-Domain Detection and Other Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01496v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different domain is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning, where domain shift is a common problem that commonly results in decreased model performance. This determination is also important to evaluate the output quality of generative models, e.g., image-to-image translation models used to mitigate domain shift. Current metrics for this either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., FID) from natural imaging which insufficiently capture anatomical consistency and realism in medical images. We introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images: Radiomic Feature Distance (RaD), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful and interpretable image features. We show that RaD is superior to other metrics for out-of-domain (OOD) detection in a variety of experiments. Furthermore, RaD outperforms previous perceptual metrics (FID, KID, etc.) for image-to-image translation by correlating more strongly with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism, and shows similar utility for evaluating unconditional image generation. RaD also offers additional benefits such as interpretability, as well as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes. Our results are supported by broad experiments spanning four multi-domain medical image datasets, nine downstream tasks, six image translation models, and other factors, highlighting the broad potential of RaD for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

While SSL has revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by three key pitfalls: Small pre-training dataset sizes, architectures inadequate for 3D medical image analysis, and insufficient evaluation practices. In this paper, we address these issues by i) leveraging a large-scale dataset of 39k 3D brain MRI volumes and ii) using a Residual Encoder U-Net architecture within the state-of-the-art nnU-Net framework. iii) A robust development framework, incorporating 5 development and 8 testing brain MRI segmentation datasets, allowed performance-driven design decisions to optimize the simple concept of Masked Auto Encoders (MAEs) for 3D CNNs. The resulting model not only surpasses previous SSL methods but also outperforms the strong nnU-Net baseline by an average of approximately 3 Dice points setting a new state-of-the-art.

It is characterized by snoring, nasal congestion, and growth disorders. Computed Tomography (CT) emerges as a pivotal medical imaging modality, utilizing X-rays and advanced computational techniques to generate detailed cross-sectional images. Within the realm of pediatric airway assessments, CT imaging provides an insightful perspective on the shape and volume of enlarged adenoids. Despite the advances of deep learning methods for medical imaging analysis, there remains an emptiness in the segmentation of adenoid hypertrophy in CT scans. To address this research gap, we introduce TSUBF-Nett (Trans-Spatial UNet-like Network based on Bi-direction Fusion), a 3D medical image segmentation framework. TSUBF-Net is engineered to effectively discern intricate 3D spatial interlayer features in CT scans and enhance the extraction of boundary-blurring features. Notably, we propose two innovative modules within the U-shaped network architecture:the Trans-Spatial Perception module (TSP) and the Bi-directional Sampling Collaborated Fusion module (BSCF).These two modules are in charge of operating during the sampling process and strategically fusing down-sampled and up-sampled features, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce the Sobel loss term, which optimizes the smoothness of the segmentation results and enhances model accuracy. Extensive 3D segmentation experiments are conducted on several datasets. TSUBF-Net is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with the lowest HD95: 7.03, IoU:85.63, and DSC: 92.26 on our own AHSD dataset. The results in the other two public datasets also demonstrate that our methods can robustly and effectively address the challenges of 3D segmentation in CT scans.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-scale Feature Enhancement in Multi-task Learning for Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00351v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional deep learning methods in medical imaging often focus solely on segmentation or classification, limiting their ability to leverage shared information. Multi-task learning (MTL) addresses this by combining both tasks through shared representations but often struggles to balance local spatial features for segmentation and global semantic features for classification, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective UNet-based MTL model, where features extracted by the encoder are used to predict classification labels, while the decoder produces the segmentation mask. The model introduces an advanced encoder incorporating a novel ResFormer block that integrates local context from convolutional feature extraction with long-range dependencies modeled by the Transformer. This design captures broader contextual relationships and fine-grained details, improving classification and segmentation accuracy. To enhance classification performance, multi-scale features from different encoder levels are combined to leverage the hierarchical representation of the input image. For segmentation, the features passed to the decoder via skip connections are refined using a novel dilated feature enhancement (DFE) module, which captures information at different scales through three parallel convolution branches with varying dilation rates. This allows the decoder to detect lesions of varying sizes with greater accuracy. Experimental results across multiple medical datasets confirm the superior performance of our model in both segmentation and classification tasks, compared to state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task learning methods.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Adaptive Interactive Segmentation for Multimodal Medical Imaging via Selection Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19447v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical image analysis, achieving fast, efficient, and accurate segmentation is essential for automated diagnosis and treatment. Although recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved segmentation accuracy, current models often face challenges in adaptability and generalization, particularly when processing multi-modal medical imaging data. These limitations stem from the substantial variations between imaging modalities and the inherent complexity of medical data. To address these challenges, we propose the Strategy-driven Interactive Segmentation Model (SISeg), built on SAM2, which enhances segmentation performance across various medical imaging modalities by integrating a selection engine. To mitigate memory bottlenecks and optimize prompt frame selection during the inference of 2D image sequences, we developed an automated system, the Adaptive Frame Selection Engine (AFSE). This system dynamically selects the optimal prompt frames without requiring extensive prior medical knowledge and enhances the interpretability of the model's inference process through an interactive feedback mechanism. We conducted extensive experiments on 10 datasets covering 7 representative medical imaging modalities, demonstrating the SISeg model's robust adaptability and generalization in multi-modal tasks.

Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data.

This is due to significant imaging modality-specific variations in artifacts, vascular patterns and scales, signal-to-noise ratios, and background tissues. These variations, along with domain gaps arising from varying imaging protocols, limit the generalization of existing supervised learning-based methods, requiring tedious voxel-level annotations for each dataset separately. While foundation models promise to alleviate this limitation, they typically fail to generalize to the task of blood vessel segmentation, posing a unique, complex problem. In this work, we present vesselFM, a foundation model designed specifically for the broad task of 3D blood vessel segmentation. Unlike previous models, vesselFM can effortlessly generalize to unseen domains. To achieve zero-shot generalization, we train vesselFM on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated dataset, data generated by a domain randomization scheme, and data sampled from a flow matching-based generative model. Extensive evaluations show that vesselFM outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation foundation models across four (pre-)clinically relevant imaging modalities in zero-, one-, and few-shot scenarios, therefore providing a universal solution for 3D blood vessel segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to brain tumor classification using a vision transformer with a novel cross-attention mechanism. Our approach leverages the strengths of transformers in modeling long-range dependencies and multi-scale feature fusion. We introduce two new mechanisms to improve the performance of the cross-attention fusion module: Feature Calibration Mechanism (FCM) and Selective Cross-Attention (SCA). FCM calibrates the features from different branches to make them more compatible, while SCA selectively attends to the most informative features. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in brain tumor classification, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency. The proposed FCM and SCA mechanisms can be easily integrated into other vision transformer architectures, making them a promising direction for future research in medical image analysis. Experimental results confirm that our approach surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Medical Slice Transformer: Improved Diagnosis and Explainability on 3D Medical Images with DINOv2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15802v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MRI and CT are essential clinical cross-sectional imaging techniques for diagnosing complex conditions. However, large 3D datasets with annotations for deep learning are scarce. While methods like DINOv2 are encouraging for 2D image analysis, these methods have not been applied to 3D medical images. Furthermore, deep learning models often lack explainability due to their "black-box" nature. This study aims to extend 2D self-supervised models, specifically DINOv2, to 3D medical imaging while evaluating their potential for explainable outcomes. We introduce the Medical Slice Transformer (MST) framework to adapt 2D self-supervised models for 3D medical image analysis. MST combines a Transformer architecture with a 2D feature extractor, i.e., DINOv2. We evaluate its diagnostic performance against a 3D convolutional neural network (3D ResNet) across three clinical datasets: breast MRI (651 patients), chest CT (722 patients), and knee MRI (1199 patients). Both methods were tested for diagnosing breast cancer, predicting lung nodule dignity, and detecting meniscus tears. Diagnostic performance was assessed by calculating the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). Explainability was evaluated through a radiologist's qualitative comparison of saliency maps based on slice and lesion correctness. P-values were calculated using Delong's test. MST achieved higher AUC values compared to ResNet across all three datasets: breast (0.94$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.91$\pm$0.02, P=0.02), chest (0.95$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.92$\pm$0.02, P=0.13), and knee (0.85$\pm$0.04 vs. 0.69$\pm$0.05, P=0.001). Saliency maps were consistently more precise and anatomically correct for MST than for ResNet. Self-supervised 2D models like DINOv2 can be effectively adapted for 3D medical imaging using MST, offering enhanced diagnostic accuracy and explainability compared to convolutional neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

This manual process demands high accuracy and is often time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. Automated image segmentation using artificial intelligence offers a promising alternative to streamline this workflow. However, most existing methods are supervised, requiring large, expertly annotated datasets that are not always available, and they experience significant generalization issues. Thus, unsupervised learning models can be leveraged for image segmentation, but they come at a cost of reduced accuracy, or require extensive computational resourcess. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end quantum-enhanced framework for unsupervised mammography medical images segmentation that balances between performance accuracy and computational requirements. We first introduce a quantum-inspired image representation that serves as an initial approximation of the segmentation mask. The segmentation task is then formulated as a QUBO problem, aiming to maximize the contrast between the background and the tumor region while ensuring a cohesive segmentation mask with minimal connected components. We conduct an extensive evaluation of quantum and quantum-inspired methods for image segmentation, demonstrating that quantum annealing and variational quantum circuits achieve performance comparable to classical optimization techniques. Notably, quantum annealing is shown to be an order of magnitude faster than the classical optimization method in our experiments. Our findings demonstrate that this framework achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods, including UNet-based architectures, offering a viable unsupervised alternative for breast cancer image segmentation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, it is a challenging task to obtain HR medical images, as it requires advanced instruments and significant time. Deep learning-based super-resolution methods can help to improve the resolution and perceptual quality of low-resolution (LR) medical images. Recently, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based methods have shown remarkable performance among deep learning-based super-resolution methods. Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) is a practical model for recovering HR images from real-world LR images. In our proposed approach, we use transfer learning technique and fine-tune the pre-trained Real-ESRGAN model using medical image datasets. This technique helps in improving the performance of the model. We employ the high-order degradation model of the Real-ESRGAN which better simulates real-world image degradations. This adaptation allows for generating more realistic degraded medical images, resulting in improved performance. The focus of this paper is on enhancing the resolution and perceptual quality of chest X-ray and retinal images. We use the Tuberculosis chest X-ray (Shenzhen) dataset and the STARE dataset of retinal images for fine-tuning the model. The proposed model achieves superior perceptual quality compared to the Real-ESRGAN model, effectively preserving fine details and generating images with more realistic textures.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Graph Domain Adaptation with Dual-branch Encoder and Two-level Alignment for Whole Slide Image-based Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14001v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, histopathological whole slide image (WSI)- based survival analysis has attracted much attention in medical image analysis. In practice, WSIs usually come from different hospitals or laboratories, which can be seen as different domains, and thus may have significant differences in imaging equipment, processing procedures, and sample sources. These differences generally result in large gaps in distribution between different WSI domains, and thus the survival analysis models trained on one domain may fail to transfer to another. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-branch Encoder and Two-level Alignment (DETA) framework to explore both feature and category-level alignment between different WSI domains. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as graph domain adaptation (GDA) by virtue the graph representation of WSIs. Then we construct a dual-branch graph encoder, including the message passing branch and the shortest path branch, to explicitly and implicitly extract semantic information from the graph-represented WSIs. To realize GDA, we propose a two-level alignment approach: at the category level, we develop a coupling technique by virtue of the dual-branch structure, leading to reduced divergence between the category distributions of the two domains; at the feature level, we introduce an adversarial perturbation strategy to better augment source domain feature, resulting in improved alignment in feature distribution. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to alleviate the domain shift issue for WSI data analysis. Extensive experiments on four TCGA datasets have validated the effectiveness of our proposed DETA framework and demonstrated its superior performance in WSI-based survival analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures | None |

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a promising solution to these challenges. However, existing MLLMs have limitations in fully leveraging the rich, hierarchical information embedded in 3D medical images. Inspired by clinical practice, where radiologists focus on both 3D spatial structure and 2D planar content, we propose Med-2E3, a novel MLLM for 3D medical image analysis that integrates 3D and 2D encoders. To aggregate 2D features more effectively, we design a Text-Guided Inter-Slice (TG-IS) scoring module, which scores the attention of each 2D slice based on slice contents and task instructions. To the best of our knowledge, Med-2E3 is the first MLLM to integrate both 3D and 2D features for 3D medical image analysis. Experiments on a large-scale, open-source 3D medical multimodal benchmark demonstrate that Med-2E3 exhibits task-specific attention distribution and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models, with a 14% improvement in report generation and a 5% gain in medical visual question answering (VQA), highlighting the model's potential in addressing complex multimodal clinical tasks.

We introduce CytoDiffusion, a diffusion-based classifier that effectively models blood cell morphology, combining accurate classification with robust anomaly detection, resistance to distributional shifts, interpretability, data efficiency, and superhuman uncertainty quantification. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative models in anomaly detection (AUC 0.990 vs. 0.918), resistance to domain shifts (85.85% vs. 74.38% balanced accuracy), and performance in low-data regimes (95.88% vs. 94.95% balanced accuracy). Notably, our model generates synthetic blood cell images that are nearly indistinguishable from real images, as demonstrated by an authenticity test in which expert haematologists achieved only 52.3% accuracy (95% CI: [50.5%, 54.2%]) in distinguishing real from generated images. Furthermore, we enhance model explainability through the generation of directly interpretable counterfactual heatmaps.

Our study focuses on two principal aspects of uncertainty in structured output segmentation tasks. First, we postulate that a reliable uncertainty measure should indicate predictions likely to be incorrect with high uncertainty values. Second, we investigate the merit of quantifying uncertainty at different anatomical scales (voxel, lesion, or patient). We hypothesize that uncertainty at each scale is related to specific types of errors. Our study aims to confirm this relationship by conducting separate analyses for in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our primary methodological contributions are (i) the development of novel measures for quantifying uncertainty at lesion and patient scales, derived from structural prediction discrepancies, and (ii) the extension of an error retention curve analysis framework to facilitate the evaluation of UQ performance at both lesion and patient scales. The results from a multi-centric MRI dataset of 444 patients demonstrate that our proposed measures more effectively capture model errors at the lesion and patient scales compared to measures that average voxel-scale uncertainty values. We provide the UQ protocols code at https://github.com/Medical-Image-Analysis-Laboratory/MS_WML_uncs.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Medical-Image-Analysis-Laboratory/MS_WML_uncs) |

However, in the medical field, even small improvements in accuracy can have significant clinical implications. This study explores the application of Vision Transformers (ViT), a state-of-the-art architecture in machine learning, to chest X-ray analysis, aiming to push the boundaries of diagnostic accuracy. I present a comparative analysis of two ViT-based approaches: one utilizing full chest X-ray images and another focusing on segmented lung regions. Experiments demonstrate that both methods surpass the performance of traditional CNN-based models, with the full-image ViT achieving up to 97.83% accuracy and the lung-segmented ViT reaching 96.58% accuracy in classifcation of diseases on three label and AUC of 94.54% when label numbers are increased to eight. Notably, the full-image approach showed superior performance across all metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. These findings suggest that Vision Transformers can effectively capture relevant features from chest X-rays without the need for explicit lung segmentation, potentially simplifying the preprocessing pipeline while maintaining high accuracy. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of transformer-based architectures in medical image analysis and highlights their potential to enhance diagnostic precision in clinical settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Retinal Vessel Segmentation via Neuron Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11110v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and treatment of various ophthalmic diseases. Designing a network model for this task requires meticulous tuning and extensive experimentation to handle the tiny and intertwined morphology of retinal blood vessels. To tackle this challenge, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods are developed to fully explore the space of potential network architectures and go after the most powerful one. Inspired by neuronal diversity which is the biological foundation of all kinds of intelligent behaviors in our brain, this paper introduces a novel and foundational approach to neural network design, termed ``neuron programming'', to automatically search neuronal types into a network to enhance a network's representation ability at the neuronal level, which is complementary to architecture-level enhancement done by NAS. Additionally, to mitigate the time and computational intensity of neuron programming, we develop a hypernetwork that leverages the search-derived architectural information to predict optimal neuronal configurations. Comprehensive experiments validate that neuron programming can achieve competitive performance in retinal blood segmentation, demonstrating the strong potential of neuronal diversity in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Post-hoc XAI techniques, which aim to explain black-box models after training, have raised concerns about their fidelity to model predictions. In contrast, Self-eXplainable AI (S-XAI) offers a compelling alternative by incorporating explainability directly into the training process of deep learning models. This approach allows models to generate inherent explanations that are closely aligned with their internal decision-making processes, enhancing transparency and supporting the trustworthiness, robustness, and accountability of AI systems in real-world medical applications. To facilitate the development of S-XAI methods for medical image analysis, this survey presents a comprehensive review across various image modalities and clinical applications. It covers more than 200 papers from three key perspectives: 1) input explainability through the integration of explainable feature engineering and knowledge graph, 2) model explainability via attention-based learning, concept-based learning, and prototype-based learning, and 3) output explainability by providing textual and counterfactual explanations. This paper also outlines desired characteristics of explainability and evaluation methods for assessing explanation quality, while discussing major challenges and future research directions in developing S-XAI for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Segmentation by Semantic Proportions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15608v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision aiming to identify and classify individual pixels in an image, with numerous applications in for example autonomous driving and medical image analysis. However, semantic segmentation can be highly challenging particularly due to the need for large amounts of annotated data. Annotating images is a time-consuming and costly process, often requiring expert knowledge and significant effort; moreover, saving the annotated images could dramatically increase the storage space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation, requiring the rough information of individual semantic class proportions, shortened as semantic proportions, rather than the necessity of ground-truth segmentation maps. This greatly simplifies the data annotation process and thus will significantly reduce the annotation time, cost and storage space, opening up new possibilities for semantic segmentation tasks where obtaining the full ground-truth segmentation maps may not be feasible or practical. Our proposed method of utilising semantic proportions can (i) further be utilised as a booster in the presence of ground-truth segmentation maps to gain performance without extra data and model complexity, and (ii) also be seen as a parameter-free plug-and-play module, which can be attached to existing deep neural networks designed for semantic segmentation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the good performance of our method compared to benchmark methods that rely on ground-truth segmentation maps. Utilising semantic proportions suggested in this work offers a promising direction for future semantic segmentation research.</p></details> |  | None |

Focusing on the solution of the flow map differential equation as the diffeomorphic deformation, recent methods use discrete timesteps along with various regularization terms to penalize the negative determinant of Jacobian and impose smoothness of the solution vector field. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach for diffeomorphic 3D-image registration which finds the diffeomorphisms in the time continuum with only a single regularization term and no additional integration. As one of the fundamental properties of flow maps, we exploit the semigroup property as the only form of regularization, ensuring temporally continuous diffeomorphic flows between pairs of images. Leveraging this property, our method alleviates the need for additional regularization terms and scaling and squaring integration during both training and evaluation. To achieve time-continuous diffeomorphisms, we employ time-embedded UNets, an architecture commonly utilized in diffusion models. The proposed method reveals that ensuring diffeomorphism in a continuous time interval leads to better registration results. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over both learning-based and optimization-based methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures | None |

Recent approaches generally rely on weakly supervised learning due to the ease of acquiring case-level labels from pathology reports. However, patch-level classification is preferable in applications where only a limited number of cases are available or when local prediction accuracy is critical. On the other hand, acquiring extensive datasets with localized labels for training is not feasible. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised patch-level histopathological image classification model, named CLASS-M, that does not require extensively labeled datasets. CLASS-M is formed by two main parts: a contrastive learning module that uses separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images generated through an adaptive stain separation process, and a module with pseudo-labels using MixUp. We compare our model with other state-of-the-art models on two clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets. We demonstrate that our CLASS-M model has the best performance on both datasets.

Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications.

In the field of medicine, while GFMs exhibit superior generalizability based on their extensive intrinsic knowledge as well as proficiency in instruction following and in-context learning, specialist models excel in precision due to their domain knowledge. In this work, for the first time, we explore the synergy between the GFM and specialist models, to enable precise medical image analysis on a broader scope. Specifically, we propose a cooperative framework, Generalist-Specialist Collaboration (GSCo), which consists of two stages, namely the construction of GFM and specialists, and collaborative inference on downstream tasks. In the construction stage, we develop MedDr, the largest open-source GFM tailored for medicine, showcasing exceptional instruction-following and in-context learning capabilities. Meanwhile, a series of lightweight specialists are crafted for downstream tasks with low computational cost. In the collaborative inference stage, we introduce two cooperative mechanisms, Mixture-of-Expert Diagnosis and Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis, to harvest the generalist's in-context learning abilities alongside the specialists' domain expertise. For a comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale benchmark featuring 28 datasets and about 250,000 images. Extensive results demonstrate that MedDr consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs on downstream datasets. Furthermore, GSCo exceeds both GFMs and specialists across all out-of-domain disease diagnosis datasets. These findings indicate a significant paradigm shift in the application of GFMs, transitioning from separate models for specific tasks to a collaborative approach between GFMs and specialists, thereby advancing the frontiers of generalizable AI in medicine.</p></details> |  | None |

We investigate this challenge and focus on model sensitivity to domain shifts, such as data sampled from different hospitals or data confounded by demographic variables such as sex, race, etc, in the context of chest X-rays and skin lesion images. A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings. Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept. We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets. In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average. Finally, evaluations reveal that PubMed is a promising resource for making medical models less sensitive to domain shift, outperforming other resources on both diversity of information and final prediction performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight), project page: https://yueyang1996.github.io/knobo/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yueyang1996.github.io/knobo) |

Techniques such as deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), are now enabling the precise analysis of complex histopathological images, automating detection, and enhancing classification accuracy across various cancer types. This study focuses on osteosarcoma (OS), the most common bone cancer in children and adolescents, which affects the long bones of the arms and legs. Early and accurate detection of OS is essential for improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality. However, the increasing prevalence of cancer and the demand for personalized treatments create challenges in achieving precise diagnoses and customized therapies. We propose a novel hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT) to improve diagnostic accuracy for OS using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathological images. The CNN model extracts local features, while the ViT captures global patterns from histopathological images. These features are combined and classified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) into four categories: non-tumor (NT), non-viable tumor (NVT), viable tumor (VT), and none-viable ratio (NVR). Using the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.08%, precision of 99.10%, recall of 99.28%, and an F1-score of 99.23%.

However, considering the inherent heterogeneity and inhomogeneity of real-world medical data, directly applying these models to specific medical image segmentation tasks often leads to negative domain shift effects, which can severely weaken the model's segmentation capabilities. To this end, we propose an adaptive amalgamation knowledge framework that aims to train a versatile foundation model to handle the joint goals of multiple expert models, each specialized for a distinct task. Specifically, we first train an nnUNet-based expert model for each task, and reuse the pre-trained SwinUNTER as the target foundation model. Then, the input data for all challenging tasks are encoded in the foundation model and the expert models, respectively, and their backbone features are jointly projected into the adaptive amalgamation layer. Within the hidden layer, the hierarchical attention mechanisms are designed to achieve adaptive merging of the target model to the hidden layer feature knowledge of all experts, which significantly reduces the domain shift arising from the inter-task differences. Finally, the gold amalgamated features and the prompt features are fed into the mask decoder to obtain the segmentation results.

The methods include ConvNet-based and Transformer-based methods. Although ConvNets can effectively utilize local information to reduce redundancy via small neighborhood convolution, the limited receptive field results in the inability to capture global dependencies. Transformers can establish long-distance dependencies via a self-attention mechanism; however, the intense calculation of the relationships among all tokens leads to high redundancy. We propose a novel unsupervised image registration method named the unified Transformer and superresolution (UTSRMorph) network, which can enhance feature representation learning in the encoder and generate detailed displacement fields in the decoder to overcome these problems. We first propose a fusion attention block to integrate the advantages of ConvNets and Transformers, which inserts a ConvNet-based channel attention module into a multihead self-attention module. The overlapping attention block, a novel cross-attention method, uses overlapping windows to obtain abundant correlations with match information of a pair of images. Then, the blocks are flexibly stacked into a new powerful encoder. The decoder generation process of a high-resolution deformation displacement field from low-resolution features is considered as a superresolution process. Specifically, the superresolution module was employed to replace interpolation upsampling, which can overcome feature degradation. UTSRMorph was compared to state-of-the-art registration methods in the 3D brain MR (OASIS, IXI) and MR-CT datasets. The qualitative and quantitative results indicate that UTSRMorph achieves relatively better performance.

Transformers, which have shown great promise in computer vision, are now being applied to medical image analysis. However, their application to histopathological images presents challenges due to the need for extensive manual annotations of whole-slide images (WSIs), as these models require large amounts of data to work effectively, which is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, the quadratic computational cost of Vision Transformers (ViTs) is particularly prohibitive for large, high-resolution histopathological images, especially on edge devices with limited computational resources. In this study, we introduce a novel lightweight breast cancer classification approach using transformers that operates effectively without large datasets. By incorporating parallel processing pathways for Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Attention and MobileConv, we convert image data from the spatial domain to the frequency domain to utilize the benefits such as filtering out high frequencies in the image, which reduces computational cost. This demonstrates the potential of our approach to improve breast cancer classification in histopathological images, offering a more efficient solution with reduced reliance on extensive annotated datasets. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 96.00% $\pm$ 0.48% for binary classification and 87.85% $\pm$ 0.93% for multiclass classification, which is comparable to state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational costs. This demonstrates the potential of our approach to improve breast cancer classification in histopathological images, offering a more efficient solution with reduced reliance on extensive annotated datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for 2024 9th International Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)</p></details> | None |

Despite the numerous registration models that have been proposed, existing methods still fall short in terms of accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we present MsMorph, a deep learning-based image registration framework aimed at mimicking the manual process of registering image pairs to achieve more similar deformations, where the registered image pairs exhibit consistency or similarity in features. By extracting the feature differences between image pairs across various as-pects using gradients, the framework decodes semantic information at different scales and continuously compen-sates for the predicted deformation field, driving the optimization of parameters to significantly improve registration accuracy. The proposed method simulates the manual approach to registration, focusing on different regions of the image pairs and their neighborhoods to predict the deformation field between the two images, which provides strong interpretability. We compared several existing registration methods on two public brain MRI datasets, including LPBA and Mindboggle. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state of the art in terms of metrics such as Dice score, Hausdorff distance, average symmetric surface distance, and non-Jacobian.

However, existing domain adaptation methods are hampered by distribution shift caused by in vivo artifacts, necessitating robust techniques for aligning noisy and artifact abundant patient endoscopic videos with clean virtual images reconstructed from pre-operative tomographic data for pose estimation during intraoperative guidance. This paper presents an artifact-resilient image translation method and an associated benchmark for this purpose. The method incorporates a novel ``local-global'' translation framework and a noise-resilient feature extraction strategy. For the former, it decouples the image translation process into a local step for feature denoising, and a global step for global style transfer. For feature extraction, a new contrastive learning strategy is proposed, which can extract noise-resilient features for establishing robust correspondence across domains. Detailed validation on both public and in-house clinical datasets has been conducted, demonstrating significantly improved performance compared to the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  | None |

However, performance disparities on specific patient groups pose challenges to their clinical utility, safety, and fairness. This can affect known patient groups - such as those based on sex, age, or disease subtype - as well as previously unknown and unlabeled groups. Furthermore, the root cause of such observed performance disparities is often challenging to uncover, hindering mitigation efforts. In this paper, to address these issues, we leverage Slice Discovery Methods (SDMs) to identify interpretable underperforming subsets of data and formulate hypotheses regarding the cause of observed performance disparities. We introduce a novel SDM and apply it in a case study on the classification of pneumothorax and atelectasis from chest x-rays. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of SDMs in hypothesis formulation and yields an explanation of previously observed but unexplained performance disparities between male and female patients in widely used chest X-ray datasets and models. Our findings indicate shortcut learning in both classification tasks, through the presence of chest drains and ECG wires, respectively. Sex-based differences in the prevalence of these shortcut features appear to cause the observed classification performance gap, representing a previously underappreciated interaction between shortcut learning and model fairness analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 Workshop on Fairness of AI in Medical Imaging</p></details> | None |

However, existing approaches are prone to overfitting and rely heavily on view-specific features, which can lead to trivial solutions. In this work, we introduce Random Token Fusion (RTF), a novel technique designed to enhance multi-view medical image analysis using vision transformers. By integrating randomness into the feature fusion process during training, RTF addresses the issue of overfitting and enhances the robustness and accuracy of diagnostic models without incurring any additional cost at inference. We validate our approach on standard mammography and chest X-ray benchmark datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RTF consistently improves the performance of existing fusion methods, paving the way for a new generation of multi-view medical foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Originally published at the NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Advancements In Medical Foundation Models: Explainability, Robustness, Security, and Beyond (AIM-FM)</p></details> | None |
| **[Private, Efficient and Scalable Kernel Learning for Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15840v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical imaging is key in modern medicine. From magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to microscopic imaging for blood cell detection, diagnostic medical imaging reveals vital insights into patient health. To predict diseases or provide individualized therapies, machine learning techniques like kernel methods have been widely used. Nevertheless, there are multiple challenges for implementing kernel methods. Medical image data often originates from various hospitals and cannot be combined due to privacy concerns, and the high dimensionality of image data presents another significant obstacle. While randomised encoding offers a promising direction, existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Addressing the need for efficient privacy-preserving methods on distributed image data, we introduce OKRA (Orthonormal K-fRAmes), a novel randomized encoding-based approach for kernel-based machine learning. This technique, tailored for widely used kernel functions, significantly enhances scalability and speed compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. Through experiments conducted on various clinical image datasets, we evaluated model quality, computational performance, and resource overhead. Additionally, our method outperforms comparable approaches</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical encoder-decoder-based framework that strives to explicitly capture the local and global dependencies for volumetric 3D medical image segmentation. The proposed framework exploits local volume-based self-attention to encode the local dependencies at high resolution and introduces a novel volumetric MLP-mixer to capture the global dependencies at low-resolution feature representations, respectively. The proposed volumetric MLP-mixer learns better associations among volumetric feature representations. These explicit local and global feature representations contribute to better learning of the shape-boundary characteristics of the organs. Extensive experiments on three different datasets reveal that the proposed method achieves favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On the challenging Synapse Multi-organ dataset, the proposed method achieves an absolute 3.82\% gain over the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of HD95 evaluation metrics {while a similar improvement pattern is exhibited in MSD Liver and Pancreas tumor datasets}. We also provide a detailed comparison between recent architectural design choices in the 2D computer vision literature by adapting them for the problem of 3D medical image segmentation. Finally, our experiments on the ZebraFish 3D cell membrane dataset having limited training data demonstrate the superior transfer learning capabilities of the proposed vMixer model on the challenging 3D cell instance segmentation task, where accurate boundary prediction plays a vital role in distinguishing individual cell instances.</p></details> |  | None |

ML's proponents laud its capacity to handle vast, complicated, and erratic medical data. It's common knowledge that attackers might cause misclassification by deliberately creating inputs for machine learning classifiers. Research on adversarial examples has been extensively conducted in the field of computer vision applications. Healthcare systems are thought to be highly difficult because of the security and life-or-death considerations they include, and performance accuracy is very important. Recent arguments have suggested that adversarial attacks could be made against medical image analysis (MedIA) technologies because of the accompanying technology infrastructure and powerful financial incentives. Since the diagnosis will be the basis for important decisions, it is essential to assess how strong medical DNN tasks are against adversarial attacks. Simple adversarial attacks have been taken into account in several earlier studies. However, DNNs are susceptible to more risky and realistic attacks. The present paper covers recent proposed adversarial attack strategies against DNNs for medical imaging as well as countermeasures. In this study, we review current techniques for adversarial imaging attacks, detections. It also encompasses various facets of these techniques and offers suggestions for the robustness of neural networks to be improved in the future.</p></details> |  | None |

The current breakthrough in computer vision algorithms and deep learning approaches has substantially enhanced the effectiveness and precision of apps built to recognize and locate regions of interest inside medical photographs. Among the different disciplines of medical image analysis, bone fracture detection, and classification have exhibited exceptional potential. Although numerous imaging modalities are applied in medical diagnostics, X-rays are particularly significant in this sector due to their broad availability, ease of use, and extensive information extraction capabilities. This research studies bone fracture categorization using the FracAtlas dataset, which comprises 4,083 musculoskeletal radiography pictures. Given the transformational development in transfer learning, particularly its efficacy in medical image processing, we deploy an attention-based transfer learning model to detect bone fractures in X-ray scans. Though the popular InceptionV3 and DenseNet121 deep learning models have been widely used, they still have the potential to be employed in crucial jobs. In this research, alongside transfer learning, a separate attention mechanism is also applied to boost the capabilities of transfer learning techniques. Through rigorous optimization, our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of more than 90\% in fracture classification. This work contributes to the expanding corpus of research focused on the application of transfer learning to medical imaging, notably in the context of X-ray processing, and emphasizes the promise for additional exploration in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 tables, 4 figures, submitted to 27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT) to be held during 20-22 December, 2024</p></details> | None |

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, which analyze CT images, have proven effective in detecting and classifying pulmonary nodules, significantly enhancing the detection rate of early-stage lung cancer. Although traditional machine learning algorithms have been valuable, they exhibit limitations in handling complex sample data. The recent emergence of deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, driving substantial advancements in this field. This review focuses on recent progress in deep learning for pulmonary nodule detection, segmentation, and classification. Traditional machine learning methods, such as SVM and KNN, have shown limitations, paving the way for advanced approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The integration of ensemble models and novel techniques is also discussed, emphasizing the latest developments in lung cancer diagnosis. Deep learning algorithms, combined with various analytical techniques, have markedly improved the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary nodule analysis, surpassing traditional methods, particularly in nodule classification. Although challenges remain, continuous technological advancements are expected to further strengthen the role of deep learning in medical diagnostics, especially for early lung cancer detection and diagnosis.

Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns.

| **[UniCoN: Universal Conditional Networks for Multi-Age Embryonic Cartilage Segmentation with Sparsely Annotated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13043v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Osteochondrodysplasia, affecting 2-3% of newborns globally, is a group of bone and cartilage disorders that often result in head malformations, contributing to childhood morbidity and reduced quality of life. Current research on this disease using mouse models faces challenges since it involves accurately segmenting the developing cartilage in 3D micro-CT images of embryonic mice. Tackling this segmentation task with deep learning (DL) methods is laborious due to the big burden of manual image annotation, expensive due to the high acquisition costs of 3D micro-CT images, and difficult due to embryonic cartilage's complex and rapidly changing shapes. While DL approaches have been proposed to automate cartilage segmentation, most such models have limited accuracy and generalizability, especially across data from different embryonic age groups. To address these limitations, we propose novel DL methods that can be adopted by any DL architectures -- including CNNs, Transformers, or hybrid models -- which effectively leverage age and spatial information to enhance model performance. Specifically, we propose two new mechanisms, one conditioned on discrete age categories and the other on continuous image crop locations, to enable an accurate representation of cartilage shape changes across ages and local shape details throughout the cranial region. Extensive experiments on multi-age cartilage segmentation datasets show significant and consistent performance improvements when integrating our conditional modules into popular DL segmentation architectures. On average, we achieve a 1.7% Dice score increase with minimal computational overhead and a 7.5% improvement on unseen data. These results highlight the potential of our approach for developing robust, universal models capable of handling diverse datasets with limited annotated data, a key challenge in DL-based medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ODES: Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Online Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05407v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation typically relies on self-training using pseudo labels predicted by a pre-trained network on an unlabeled target dataset. However, the noisy nature of such pseudo-labels presents a major bottleneck in adapting a network to the distribution shift between source and target datasets. This challenge is exaggerated when the network encounters an incoming data stream in online fashion, where the network is constrained to adapt to incoming streams of target domain data in exactly one round of forward and backward passes. In this scenario, relying solely on inaccurate pseudo-labels can lead to low-quality segmentation, which is detrimental to medical image analysis where accuracy and precision are of utmost priority. We hypothesize that a small amount of pixel-level annotation obtained from an expert can address this problem, thereby enhancing the performance of domain adaptation of online streaming data, even in the absence of dedicated training data. We call our method ODES: Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Online Medical Image Segmentation that adapts to each incoming data batch in an online setup, incorporating feedback from an expert through active learning. Through active learning, the most informative pixels in each image can be selected for expert annotation. However, the acquisition of pixel-level annotations across all images in a batch often leads to redundant information while increasing temporal overhead in online learning. To reduce the annotation acquisition time and make the adaptation process more online-friendly, we further propose a novel image-pruning strategy that selects the most useful subset of images from the current batch for active learning. Our proposed approach outperforms existing online adaptation approaches and produces competitive results compared to offline domain adaptive active learning methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the high demands of acquisition device, collection of HR images with their annotations is always impractical in clinical scenarios. Consequently, segmentation results based on low-resolution (LR) images with large slice thickness are often unsatisfactory for subsequent tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Resource-Efficient High-Resolution Segmentation framework (REHRSeg) to address the above-mentioned challenges in real-world applications, which can achieve HR segmentation while only employing the LR images as input. REHRSeg is designed to leverage self-supervised super-resolution (self-SR) to provide pseudo supervision, therefore the relatively easier-to-acquire LR annotated images generated by 2D scanning protocols can be directly used for model training. The main contribution to ensure the effectiveness in self-SR for enhancing segmentation is three-fold: (1) We mitigate the data scarcity problem in the medical field by using pseudo-data for training the segmentation model. (2) We design an uncertainty-aware super-resolution (UASR) head in self-SR to raise the awareness of segmentation uncertainty as commonly appeared on the ROI boundaries. (3) We align the spatial features for self-SR and segmentation through structural knowledge distillation to enable a better capture of region correlations. Experimental results demonstrate that REHRSeg achieves high-quality HR segmentation without intensive supervision, while also significantly improving the baseline performance for LR segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches to few-shot segmentation have often overlooked the potential of the query itself, failing to fully utilize the valuable information it contains. However, treating the query as unlabeled data provides an opportunity to enhance prediction accuracy. Specifically in the domain of medical imaging, the volumetric structure of queries offers a considerable source of valuable information that can be used to improve the target slice segmentation. In this work, we present a novel strategy to efficiently leverage the intrinsic information of the query sample for final segmentation during inference. First, we use the support slices from a reference volume to generate an initial segmentation score for the query slices through a prototypical approach. Subsequently, we apply a confidence-aware pseudo-labeling procedure to transfer the most informative parts of query slices to the support set. The final prediction is performed based on the new expanded support set, enabling the prediction of a more accurate segmentation mask for the query volume. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can effectively boost performance across diverse settings and datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Large-Scale 3D Medical Image Pre-training with Geometric Context Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09890v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of annotations poses a significant challenge in medical image analysis. Large-scale pre-training has emerged as a promising label-efficient solution, owing to the utilization of large-scale data, large models, and advanced pre-training techniques. However, its development in medical images remains underexplored. The primary challenge lies in harnessing large-scale unlabeled data and learning high-level semantics without annotations. We observe that 3D medical images exhibit consistent geometric context, i.e., consistent geometric relations between different organs, which leads to a promising way for learning consistent representations. Motivated by this, we introduce a simple-yet-effective Volume Contrast (VoCo) framework to leverage geometric context priors for self-supervision. Given an input volume, we extract base crops from different regions to construct positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning. Then we predict the contextual position of a random crop by contrasting its similarity to the base crops. In this way, VoCo encodes the inherent geometric context into model representations, facilitating high-level semantic learning without annotations. Specifically, we (1) introduce the largest medical pre-training dataset PreCT-160K; (2) investigate scaling laws and propose guidelines for tailoring different model sizes to various medical tasks; (3) build a benchmark encompassing 48 medical tasks. Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of VoCo.

In particular, deep neural networks based on a U-shaped architecture (UNet) with skip connections have been adopted for several medical imaging tasks, including organ segmentation. Despite their great success, CNNs are not good at learning global or semantic features. Especially ones that require human-like reasoning to understand the context. Many UNet architectures attempted to adjust with the introduction of Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms, and notable gains in performance have been noted. However, the transformers are inherently flawed with redundancy to learn at shallow layers, which often leads to an increase in the computation of attention from the nearby pixels offering limited information. The recently introduced Super Token Attention (STA) mechanism adapts the concept of superpixels from pixel space to token space, using super tokens as compact visual representations. This approach tackles the redundancy by learning efficient global representations in vision transformers, especially for the shallow layers. In this work, we introduce the STA module in the UNet architecture (STA-UNet), to limit redundancy without losing rich information. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of STA-UNet over existing state-of-the-art architectures in terms of Dice score and IOU for organ segmentation tasks.

VoxelPrompt is multi-modal and versatile, leveraging the flexibility of language interaction while providing quantitatively grounded image analysis. Given a variable number of 3D medical volumes, such as MRI and CT scans, VoxelPrompt employs a language agent that iteratively predicts executable instructions to solve a task specified by an input prompt. These instructions communicate with a vision network to encode image features and generate volumetric outputs (e.g., segmentations). VoxelPrompt interprets the results of intermediate instructions and plans further actions to compute discrete measures (e.g., tumor growth across a series of scans) and present relevant outputs to the user. We evaluate this framework in a sandbox of diverse neuroimaging tasks, and we show that the single VoxelPrompt model can delineate hundreds of anatomical and pathological features, measure many complex morphological properties, and perform open-language analysis of lesion characteristics. VoxelPrompt carries out these objectives with accuracy similar to that of fine-tuned, single-task models for segmentation and visual question-answering, while facilitating a much larger range of tasks. Therefore, by supporting accurate image processing with language interaction, VoxelPrompt provides comprehensive utility for numerous imaging tasks that traditionally require specialized models to address.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, vision-language agent, medical image analysis, neuroimage foundation model</p></details> | None |
| **[Medical Image Registration via Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03111v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration is an essential step in many medical image analysis tasks. Traditional methods for image registration are primarily optimization-driven, finding the optimal deformations that maximize the similarity between two images. Recent learning-based methods, trained to directly predict transformations between two images, run much faster, but suffer from performance deficiencies due to model generalization and the inefficiency in handling individual image specific deformations. Here we present a new neural net based image registration framework, called NIR (Neural Image Registration), which is based on optimization but utilizes deep neural nets to model deformations between image pairs. NIR represents the transformation between two images with a continuous function implemented via neural fields, receiving a 3D coordinate as input and outputting the corresponding deformation vector. NIR provides two ways of generating deformation field: directly output a displacement vector field for general deformable registration, or output a velocity vector field and integrate the velocity field to derive the deformation field for diffeomorphic image registration. The optimal registration is discovered by updating the parameters of the neural field via stochastic gradient descent. We describe several design choices that facilitate model optimization, including coordinate encoding, sinusoidal activation, coordinate sampling, and intensity sampling. Experiments on two 3D MR brain scan datasets demonstrate that NIR yields state-of-the-art performance in terms of both registration accuracy and regularity, while running significantly faster than traditional optimization-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Medical Image Quality Assessment based on Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08118v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image quality assessment (MIQA) is essential for reliable medical image analysis. While deep learning has shown promise in this field, current models could be misled by spurious correlations learned from data and struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To that end, we propose an MIQA framework based on a concept from causal inference: Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS). PNS measures how likely a set of features is to be both necessary (always present for an outcome) and sufficient (capable of guaranteeing an outcome) for a particular result. Our approach leverages this concept by learning hidden features from medical images with high PNS values for quality prediction. This encourages models to capture more essential predictive information, enhancing their robustness to OOD scenarios. We evaluate our framework on an Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) dataset for the MIQA task and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

However, when the inference dataset slightly differs from what the model has seen during one-time training, the model performance is greatly compromised. The situation requires restarting the training process using both the old and the new data which is computationally costly, does not align with the human learning process, and imposes storage constraints and privacy concerns. Alternatively, continual learning has emerged as a crucial approach for developing unified and sustainable deep models to deal with new classes, tasks, and the drifting nature of data in non-stationary environments for various application areas. Continual learning techniques enable models to adapt and accumulate knowledge over time, which is essential for maintaining performance on evolving datasets and novel tasks. This systematic review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in continual learning techniques applied to medical imaging analysis. We present an extensive survey of existing research, covering topics including catastrophic forgetting, data drifts, stability, and plasticity requirements. Further, an in-depth discussion of key components of a continual learning framework such as continual learning scenarios, techniques, evaluation schemes, and metrics is provided.

However, there is still a gap in models specifically designed for medical image localization. To address this, we introduce MedLAM, a 3D medical foundation localization model that accurately identifies any anatomical part within the body using only a few template scans. MedLAM employs two self-supervision tasks: unified anatomical mapping (UAM) and multi-scale similarity (MSS) across a comprehensive dataset of 14,012 CT scans. Furthermore, we developed MedLSAM by integrating MedLAM with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). This innovative framework requires extreme point annotations across three directions on several templates to enable MedLAM to locate the target anatomical structure in the image, with SAM performing the segmentation. It significantly reduces the amount of manual annotation required by SAM in 3D medical imaging scenarios. We conducted extensive experiments on two 3D datasets covering 38 distinct organs. Our findings are twofold: 1) MedLAM can directly localize anatomical structures using just a few template scans, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models; 2) MedLSAM closely matches the performance of SAM and its specialized medical adaptations with manual prompts, while minimizing the need for extensive point annotations across the entire dataset. Moreover, MedLAM has the potential to be seamlessly integrated with future 3D SAM models, paving the way for enhanced segmentation performance.

When accompanied by the innovative federated learning (FL) framework, ML techniques can further overcome privacy concerns related to patient data exposure. Given the frequent presence of diverse data modalities within patient records, leveraging FL in a multi-modal learning framework holds considerable promise for cancer staging. However, existing works on multi-modal FL often presume that all data-collecting institutions have access to all data modalities. This oversimplified approach neglects institutions that have access to only a portion of data modalities within the system. In this work, we introduce a novel FL architecture designed to accommodate not only the heterogeneity of data samples, but also the inherent heterogeneity/non-uniformity of data modalities across institutions. We shed light on the challenges associated with varying convergence speeds observed across different data modalities within our FL system. Subsequently, we propose a solution to tackle these challenges by devising a distributed gradient blending and proximity-aware client weighting strategy tailored for multi-modal FL. To show the superiority of our method, we conduct experiments using The Cancer Genome Atlas program (TCGA) datalake considering different cancer types and three modalities of data: mRNA sequences, histopathological image data, and clinical information.

| **[FACMIC: Federated Adaptative CLIP Model for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14707v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to medical image analysis that allows deep model training using decentralized data while ensuring data privacy. However, in the field of FL, communication cost plays a critical role in evaluating the performance of the model. Thus, transferring vision foundation models can be particularly challenging due to the significant resource costs involved. In this paper, we introduce a federated adaptive Contrastive Language Image Pretraining CLIP model designed for classification tasks. We employ a light-weight and efficient feature attention module for CLIP that selects suitable features for each client's data. Additionally, we propose a domain adaptation technique to reduce differences in data distribution between clients.

| **[Federated brain tumor segmentation: an extensive benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17265v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, federated learning has raised increasing interest in the medical image analysis field due to its ability to aggregate multi-center data with privacy-preserving properties. A large amount of federated training schemes have been published, which we categorize into global (one final model), personalized (one model per institution) or hybrid (one model per cluster of institutions) methods. However, their applicability on the recently published Federated Brain Tumor Segmentation 2022 dataset has not been explored yet. We propose an extensive benchmark of federated learning algorithms from all three classes on this task. While standard FedAvg already performs very well, we show that some methods from each category can bring a slight performance improvement and potentially limit the final model(s) bias toward the predominant data distribution of the federation. Moreover, we provide a deeper understanding of the behaviour of federated learning on this task through alternative ways of distributing the pooled dataset among institutions, namely an Independent and Identical Distributed (IID) setup, and a limited data setup.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Survey on Trustworthiness in Foundation Models for Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15851v2)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of foundation models in medical imaging represents a significant leap toward enhancing diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment. However, the deployment of foundation models in healthcare necessitates a rigorous examination of their trustworthiness, encompassing privacy, robustness, reliability, explainability, and fairness. The current body of survey literature on foundation models in medical imaging reveals considerable gaps, particularly in the area of trustworthiness. Additionally, existing surveys on the trustworthiness of foundation models do not adequately address their specific variations and applications within the medical imaging domain. This survey aims to fill that gap by presenting a novel taxonomy of foundation models used in medical imaging and analyzing the key motivations for ensuring their trustworthiness. We review current research on foundation models in major medical imaging applications, focusing on segmentation, medical report generation, medical question and answering (Q\&A), and disease diagnosis. These areas are highlighted because they have seen a relatively mature and substantial number of foundation models compared to other applications. We focus on literature that discusses trustworthiness in medical image analysis manuscripts. We explore the complex challenges of building trustworthy foundation models for each application, summarizing current concerns and strategies for enhancing trustworthiness. Furthermore, we examine the potential of these models to revolutionize patient care. Our analysis underscores the imperative for advancing towards trustworthy AI in medical image analysis, advocating for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring ethical and equitable healthcare delivery.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generalizing Medical Image Representations via Quaternion Wavelet Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10224v4)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network generalizability is becoming a broad research field due to the increasing availability of datasets from different sources and for various tasks. This issue is even wider when processing medical data, where a lack of methodological standards causes large variations being provided by different imaging centers or acquired with various devices and cofactors. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable, data- and task-agnostic framework able to extract salient features from medical images. The proposed quaternion wavelet network (QUAVE) can be easily integrated with any pre-existing medical image analysis or synthesis task, and it can be involved with real, quaternion, or hypercomplex-valued models, generalizing their adoption to single-channel data. QUAVE first extracts different sub-bands through the quaternion wavelet transform, resulting in both low-frequency/approximation bands and high-frequency/fine-grained features. Then, it weighs the most representative set of sub-bands to be involved as input to any other neural model for image processing, replacing standard data samples. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation comprising different datasets, diverse image analysis, and synthesis tasks including reconstruction, segmentation, and modality translation. We also evaluate QUAVE in combination with both real and quaternion-valued models. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalizability of the proposed framework that improves network performance while being flexible to be adopted in manifold scenarios and robust to domain shifts.

| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Mamba Architectures for Medical Image Analysis: Classification, Segmentation, Restoration and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02362v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.</p></details> |  | None |

Spine imaging is an essential tool for noninvasively visualizing and assessing spinal pathology. Segmenting vertebrae in computed tomography (CT) images is the basis of quantitative medical image analysis for clinical diagnosis and surgery planning of spine diseases. Current publicly available annotated datasets on spinal vertebrae are small in size. Due to the lack of a large-scale annotated spine image dataset, the mainstream deep learning-based segmentation methods, which are data-driven, are heavily restricted. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated from multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT volumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal conditions. Based on this dataset, we conduct several spinal vertebrae segmentation experiments to set the first benchmark. We believe that this large-scale dataset will facilitate further research in many spine-related image analysis tasks, including but not limited to vertebrae segmentation, labeling, 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, image super-resolution, and enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2024 Open Data for oral presentation and will be published as a part of the journal MELBA special issue</p></details> | None |
| **[CTARR: A fast and robust method for identifying anatomical regions on CT images via atlas registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02316v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image analysis tasks often focus on regions or structures located in a particular location within the patient's body. Often large parts of the image may not be of interest for the image analysis task. When using deep-learning based approaches, this causes an unnecessary increases the computational burden during inference and raises the chance of errors. In this paper, we introduce CTARR, a novel generic method for CT Anatomical Region Recognition. The method serves as a pre-processing step for any deep learning-based CT image analysis pipeline by automatically identifying the pre-defined anatomical region that is relevant for the follow-up task and removing the rest. It can be used in (i) image segmentation to prevent false positives in anatomically implausible regions and speeding up the inference, (ii) image classification to produce image crops that are consistent in their anatomical context, and (iii) image registration by serving as a fast pre-registration step. Our proposed method is based on atlas registration and provides a fast and robust way to crop any anatomical region encoded as one or multiple bounding box(es) from any unlabeled CT scan of the brain, chest, abdomen and/or pelvis. We demonstrate the utility and robustness of the proposed method in the context of medical image segmentation by evaluating it on six datasets of public segmentation challenges. The foreground voxels in the regions of interest are preserved in the vast majority of cases and tasks (97.45-100%) while taking only fractions of a seconds to compute (0.1-0.21s) on a deep learning workstation and greatly reducing the segmentation runtime (2.0-12.7x).

It aims to train well-generalized models from a large number of images that follow a long-tailed class distribution. In the medical field, many diagnostic imaging exams such as dermoscopy and chest radiography yield a long-tailed distribution of complex clinical findings. Recently, long-tailed learning in medical image analysis has garnered significant attention. However, the field currently lacks a unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often leads to unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. To help the community improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified, well-structured codebase called Medical OpeN-source Long-taIled ClassifiCAtion (MONICA), which implements over 30 methods developed in relevant fields and evaluated on 12 long-tailed medical datasets covering 6 medical domains. Our work provides valuable practical guidance and insights for the field, offering detailed analysis and discussion on the effectiveness of individual components within the inbuilt state-of-the-art methodologies. We hope this codebase serves as a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark, encouraging further advancements in long-tailed medical image learning.

This study presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning-based methods, Mamba, SAM, and YOLO, for segmenting prostate cancer histopathology images. We evaluated the performance of these models on two comprehensive datasets, Gleason 2019 and SICAPv2, using Dice score, precision, and recall metrics. Our results show that the High-order Vision Mamba UNet (H-vmunet) model outperforms the other two models, achieving the highest scores across all metrics on both datasets. The H-vmunet model's advanced architecture, which integrates high-order visual state spaces and 2D-selective-scan operations, enables efficient and sensitive lesion detection across different scales. Our study demonstrates the potential of the H-vmunet model for clinical applications and highlights the importance of robust validation and comparison of deep learning-based methods for medical image analysis.

| **[The Impact of Scanner Domain Shift on Deep Learning Performance in Medical Imaging: an Experimental Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04368v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Medical images acquired using different scanners and protocols can differ substantially in their appearance. This phenomenon, scanner domain shift, can result in a drop in the performance of deep neural networks which are trained on data acquired by one scanner and tested on another. This significant practical issue is well-acknowledged, however, no systematic study of the issue is available across different modalities and diagnostic tasks. Materials and Methods: In this paper, we present a broad experimental study evaluating the impact of scanner domain shift on convolutional neural network performance for different automated diagnostic tasks. We evaluate this phenomenon in common radiological modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. Results: We find that network performance on data from a different scanner is almost always worse than on same-scanner data, and we quantify the degree of performance drop across different datasets. Notably, we find that this drop is most severe for MRI, moderate for X-ray, and quite small for CT, on average, which we attribute to the standardized nature of CT acquisition systems which is not present in MRI or X-ray. We also study how injecting varying amounts of target domain data into the training set, as well as adding noise to the training data, helps with generalization. Conclusion: Our results provide extensive experimental evidence and quantification of the extent of performance drop caused by scanner domain shift in deep learning across different modalities, with the goal of guiding the future development of robust deep learning models for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Hence, recent studies have focused on pretrained models with fewer annotation requirements that can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches are mainly 3D adaptions of 2D approaches ill-suited for 3D medical imaging data. Motivated by this gap, we propose novel domain-aware multi-task learning tasks to pretrain a 3D Swin Transformer for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our method considers the domain knowledge in brain MRI by incorporating brain anatomy and morphology as well as standard pretext tasks adapted for 3D imaging in a contrastive learning setting. We pretrain our model using large-scale brain MRI data of 13,687 samples spanning several large-scale databases. Our method outperforms existing supervised and self-supervised methods in three downstream tasks of Alzheimer's disease classification, Parkinson's disease classification, and age prediction tasks. The ablation study of the proposed pretext tasks shows the effectiveness of our pretext tasks.</p></details> | ACCV 2024, 14 pages | None |

Numerous efforts employ generative models to generate high-fidelity, unlabeled 3D volumes across diverse modalities and anatomical regions. However, the intricate and indistinguishable anatomical structures within the abdomen pose a unique challenge to abdominal CT volume generation compared to other anatomical regions. To address the overlooked challenge, we introduce the Locality-Aware Diffusion (Lad), a novel method tailored for exquisite 3D abdominal CT volume generation. We design a locality loss to refine crucial anatomical regions and devise a condition extractor to integrate abdominal priori into generation, thereby enabling the generation of large quantities of high-quality abdominal CT volumes essential for SSL tasks without the need for additional data such as labels or radiology reports. Volumes generated through our method demonstrate remarkable fidelity in reproducing abdominal structures, achieving a decrease in FID score from 0.0034 to 0.0002 on AbdomenCT-1K dataset, closely mirroring authentic data and surpassing current methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in self-supervised organ segmentation tasks, resulting in an improvement in mean Dice scores on two abdominal datasets effectively. These results underscore the potential of synthetic data to advance self-supervised learning in medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual-Attention Frequency Fusion at Multi-Scale for Joint Segmentation and Deformable Medical Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19658v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable medical image registration is a crucial aspect of medical image analysis. In recent years, researchers have begun leveraging auxiliary tasks (such as supervised segmentation) to provide anatomical structure information for the primary registration task, addressing complex deformation challenges in medical image registration. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning framework based on multi-scale dual attention frequency fusion (DAFF-Net), which simultaneously achieves the segmentation masks and dense deformation fields in a single-step estimation. DAFF-Net consists of a global encoder, a segmentation decoder, and a coarse-to-fine pyramid registration decoder. During the registration decoding process, we design the dual attention frequency feature fusion (DAFF) module to fuse registration and segmentation features at different scales, fully leveraging the correlation between the two tasks. The DAFF module optimizes the features through global and local weighting mechanisms. During local weighting, it incorporates both high-frequency and low-frequency information to further capture the features that are critical for the registration task. With the aid of segmentation, the registration learns more precise anatomical structure information, thereby enhancing the anatomical consistency of the warped images after registration. Additionally, due to the DAFF module's outstanding ability to extract effective feature information, we extend its application to unsupervised registration. Extensive experiments on three public 3D brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets demonstrate that the proposed DAFF-Net and its unsupervised variant outperform state-of-the-art registration methods across several evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in deformable medical image registration.</p></details> |  | None |

These synthetic images can serve as an effective data augmentation method to aid the development of more accurate machine learning models for medical image analysis. While the fidelity of these synthetic images has progressively increased, the diversity of these images is an understudied phenomenon. In this work, we propose the SDICE index, which is based on the characterization of similarity distributions induced by a contrastive encoder. Given a synthetic dataset and a reference dataset of real images, the SDICE index measures the distance between the similarity score distributions of original and synthetic images, where the similarity scores are estimated using a pre-trained contrastive encoder. This distance is then normalized using an exponential function to provide a consistent metric that can be easily compared across domains. Experiments conducted on the MIMIC-chest X-ray and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SDICE index in assessing synthetic medical dataset diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2024 - PFATCV</p></details> | None |

First, we conduct a thorough analysis of the cervical spinal cord within a healthy population. Unlike most previous studies, which required medical professionals to perform functional examinations using metrics like the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score or the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale, this research focuses solely on Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of the cervical spinal cord. Second, we employ cutting-edge deep learning-based segmentation methods to achieve highly accurate macrostructural measurements from MR images. To this end, we propose an enhanced UNet-like Transformer-based framework with attentive skip connections.

The demand for automated report generation systems has become increasingly urgent. While prior research has mainly focused on using machine learning and multimodal language models for 2D medical images, the generation of reports for 3D medical images has been less explored due to data scarcity and computational complexities. This paper introduces 3D-CT-GPT, a Visual Question Answering (VQA)-based medical visual language model specifically designed for generating radiology reports from 3D CT scans, particularly chest CTs. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets demonstrate that 3D-CT-GPT significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of report accuracy and quality. Although current methods are few, including the partially open-source CT2Rep and the open-source M3D, we ensured fair comparison through appropriate data conversion and evaluation methodologies. Experimental results indicate that 3D-CT-GPT enhances diagnostic accuracy and report coherence, establishing itself as a robust solution for clinical radiology report generation. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and further optimizing the model to enhance its performance and applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to these restrictions, existing CLIP applications in medical imaging focus mainly on modalities like chest X-rays that have abundant image-report data available, leaving many other important modalities under-explored. Here, we propose the first adaptation of the full CLIP model to mammography, which presents significant challenges due to labeled data scarcity, high-resolution images with small regions of interest, and data imbalance. We first develop a specialized supervision framework for mammography that leverages its multi-view nature. Furthermore, we design a symmetric local alignment module to better focus on detailed features in high-resolution images. Lastly, we incorporate a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for large language models pre-trained with medical knowledge to address data limitations. Our multi-view and multi-scale alignment (MaMA) method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for three different tasks on two large real-world mammography datasets, EMBED and RSNA-Mammo, with only 52% model size compared with the largest baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is also the basis of the overall best solution for the MICCAI 2024 CXR-LT Challenge</p></details> | None |

Benefiting from its unique encoder-decoder architecture and skip connections, it can effectively extract features from input images to segment target regions. The commonly used U-Net is typically based on convolutional operations or Transformers, modeling the dependencies between local or global information to accomplish medical image analysis tasks. However, convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and attention mechanisms used in this process introduce a significant number of parameters, often requiring the stacking of network layers to model complex nonlinear relationships, which can impact the training process. To address these issues, we propose TransUKAN. Specifically, we have improved the KAN to reduce memory usage and computational load. On this basis, we explored an effective combination of KAN, Transformer, and U-Net structures. This approach enhances the model's capability to capture nonlinear relationships by introducing only a small number of additional parameters and compensates for the Transformer structure's deficiency in local information extraction. We validated TransUKAN on multiple medical image segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TransUKAN achieves excellent performance with significantly reduced parameters.

Based on the traditional U-Net, we introduce GSConv module and ECA attention mechanism to improve the performance of the model in medical image segmentation tasks. With these improvements, the new U-Net model is able to extract and utilize multi-scale features more efficiently while flexibly focusing on important channels, resulting in significantly improved segmentation results. During the experiment, the improved U-Net model is trained and evaluated systematically. By looking at the loss curves of the training set and the test set, we find that the loss values of both rapidly decline to the lowest point after the eighth epoch, and then gradually converge and stabilize. This shows that our model has good learning ability and generalization ability. In addition, by monitoring the change in the mean intersection ratio (mIoU), we can see that after the 35th epoch, the mIoU gradually approaches 0.8 and remains stable, which further validates the model. Compared with the traditional U-Net, the improved version based on GSConv module and ECA attention mechanism shows obvious advantages in segmentation effect. Especially in the processing of brain tumor image edges, the improved model can provide more accurate segmentation results. This achievement not only improves the accuracy of medical image analysis, but also provides more reliable technical support for clinical diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; Accepted by CONF-CDS 2024 conference already</p></details> | None |

Automatic vessel segmentation is highly desirable to guide clinicians in computer-assisted diagnosis, therapy or surgical planning. Despite a good ability to extract large anatomical structures, the capacity of U-Net inspired architectures to automatically delineate vascular systems remains a major issue, especially given the scarcity of existing datasets. In this paper, we present a novel approach that integrates into deep segmentation shape priors from a Semi-Overcomplete Convolutional Auto-Encoder (S-OCAE) embedding. Compared to standard Convolutional Auto-Encoders (CAE), it exploits an over-complete branch that projects data onto higher dimensions to better characterize tiny structures.

Experimental results on two medical image datasets, including lung X-ray images and breast tissue slice images, show that this MCMC-based BNN model works very well on small-sample data and greatly improves the robustness and accuracy of classification. Model accuracy reached 85% for the lung X-ray dataset and 88% for the breast tissue slice dataset. To this end, we combine data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling with regularization methods like dropout and weight decay to improve effectively the diversity of the training data and the generalization ability of the model. The performance of the model was evaluated by many indicators of the results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. All of these have proven the advantages of BNN in small-sample medical image classification. This study not only enriches the application of BNN in the field of medical image classification, but also provides specific implementation paths and optimization methods, providing new solutions for future medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[EFCM: Efficient Fine-tuning on Compressed Models for deployment of large models in medical image analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11817v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of deep learning large models in medicine shows remarkable performance in medical image analysis and diagnosis, but their large number of parameters causes memory and inference latency challenges. Knowledge distillation offers a solution, but the slide-level gradients cannot be backpropagated for student model updates due to high-resolution pathological images and slide-level labels. This study presents an Efficient Fine-tuning on Compressed Models (EFCM) framework with two stages: unsupervised feature distillation and fine-tuning. In the distillation stage, Feature Projection Distillation (FPD) is proposed with a TransScan module for adaptive receptive field adjustment to enhance the knowledge absorption capability of the student model. In the slide-level fine-tuning stage, three strategies (Reuse CLAM, Retrain CLAM, and End2end Train CLAM (ETC)) are compared. Experiments are conducted on 11 downstream datasets related to three large medical models: RETFound for retina, MRM for chest X-ray, and BROW for histopathology. The experimental results demonstrate that the EFCM framework significantly improves accuracy and efficiency in handling slide-level pathological image problems, effectively addressing the challenges of deploying large medical models. Specifically, it achieves a 4.33% increase in ACC and a 5.2% increase in AUC compared to the large model BROW on the TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-BRCA datasets. The analysis of model inference efficiency highlights the high efficiency of the distillation fine-tuning method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Systematic Review of Generalization Research in Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12167v3)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous Deep Learning (DL) classification models have been developed for a large spectrum of medical image analysis applications, which promises to reshape various facets of medical practice. Despite early advances in DL model validation and implementation, which encourage healthcare institutions to adopt them, a fundamental questions remain: how can these models effectively handle domain shift? This question is crucial to limit DL models performance degradation. Medical data are dynamic and prone to domain shift, due to multiple factors. Two main shift types can occur over time: 1) covariate shift mainly arising due to updates to medical equipment and 2) concept shift caused by inter-grader variability. To mitigate the problem of domain shift, existing surveys mainly focus on domain adaptation techniques, with an emphasis on covariate shift. More generally, no work has reviewed the state-of-the-art solutions while focusing on the shift types. This paper aims to explore existing domain generalization methods for DL-based classification models through a systematic review of literature. It proposes a taxonomy based on the shift type they aim to solve. Papers were searched and gathered on Scopus till 10 April 2023, and after the eligibility screening and quality evaluation, 77 articles were identified. Exclusion criteria included: lack of methodological novelty (e.g., reviews, benchmarks), experiments conducted on a single mono-center dataset, or articles not written in English. The results of this paper show that learning based methods are emerging, for both shift types. Finally, we discuss future challenges, including the need for improved evaluation protocols and benchmarks, and envisioned future developments to achieve robust, generalized models for medical image classification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoReEcho: Continuous Representation Learning for 2D+time Echocardiography Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10164v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models have been advancing automatic medical image analysis on various modalities, including echocardiography, by offering a comprehensive end-to-end training pipeline. This approach enables DL models to regress ejection fraction (EF) directly from 2D+time echocardiograms, resulting in superior performance. However, the end-to-end training pipeline makes the learned representations less explainable. The representations may also fail to capture the continuous relation among echocardiogram clips, indicating the existence of spurious correlations, which can negatively affect the generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose CoReEcho, a novel training framework emphasizing continuous representations tailored for direct EF regression. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CoReEcho: 1) outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the largest echocardiography dataset (EchoNet-Dynamic) with MAE of 3.90 & R2 of 82.44, and 2) provides robust and generalizable features that transfer more effectively in related downstream tasks.

| **[Evaluating General Purpose Vision Foundation Models for Medical Image Analysis: An Experimental Study of DINOv2 on Radiology Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02366v4)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of deep learning systems into healthcare has been hindered by the resource-intensive process of data annotation and the inability of these systems to generalize to different data distributions. Foundation models, which are models pre-trained on large datasets, have emerged as a solution to reduce reliance on annotated data and enhance model generalizability and robustness. DINOv2 is an open-source foundation model pre-trained with self-supervised learning on 142 million curated natural images that exhibits promising capabilities across various vision tasks. Nevertheless, a critical question remains unanswered regarding DINOv2's adaptability to radiological imaging, and whether its features are sufficiently general to benefit radiology image analysis. Therefore, this study comprehensively evaluates the performance DINOv2 for radiology, conducting over 200 evaluations across diverse modalities (X-ray, CT, and MRI). To measure the effectiveness and generalizability of DINOv2's feature representations, we analyze the model across medical image analysis tasks including disease classification and organ segmentation on both 2D and 3D images, and under different settings like kNN, few-shot learning, linear-probing, end-to-end fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparative analyses with established supervised, self-supervised, and weakly-supervised models reveal DINOv2's superior performance and cross-task generalizability. The findings contribute insights to potential avenues for optimizing pre-training strategies for medical imaging and enhancing the broader understanding of DINOv2's role in bridging the gap between natural and radiological image analysis.

| **[Improved Unet model for brain tumor image segmentation based on ASPP-coordinate attention mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08588v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an improved Unet model for brain tumor image segmentation, which combines coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module to improve the segmentation effect. After the data set is divided, we do the necessary preprocessing to the image and use the improved model to experiment. First, we trained and validated the traditional Unet model. By analyzing the loss curve of the training set and the validation set, we can see that the loss value continues to decline at the first epoch and becomes stable at the eighth epoch. This process shows that the model constantly optimizes its parameters to improve performance. At the same time, the change in the miou (mean Intersection over Union) index shows that the miou value exceeded 0.6 at the 15th epoch, remained above 0.6 thereafter, and reached above 0.7 at the 46th epoch. These results indicate that the basic Unet model is effective in brain tumor image segmentation. Next, we introduce an improved Unet algorithm based on coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module for experiments. By observing the loss change curves of the training set and the verification set, it is found that the loss value reaches the lowest point at the sixth epoch and then remains relatively stable. At the same time, the miou indicator has stabilized above 0.7 since the 20th epoch and has reached a maximum of 0.76. These results show that the new mechanism introduced significantly improves the segmentation ability of the model. Finally, we apply the trained traditional Unet model and the improved Unet model based on the coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module to the test set for brain tumor image segmentation prediction. Compared to the traditional Unet, the enhanced model offers superior segmentation and edge accuracy, providing a more reliable method for medical image analysis with the coordinate attention mechanism and ASPP module.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ICBASE 2024</p></details> | None |

Despite recent methodological advancements in image analysis techniques like image segmentation, registration, and domain-specific image computing algorithms, only a few works focus on building fully automated pipelines for imaging feature extraction. In this study, we developed a deep-learning-based medical image analysis application for knee cartilage morphometrics, CartiMorph Toolbox (CMT). We proposed a 2-stage joint template learning and registration network, CMT-reg. We trained the model using the OAI-ZIB dataset and assessed its performance in template-to-image registration. The CMT-reg demonstrated competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art models. We integrated the proposed model into an automated pipeline for the quantification of cartilage shape and lesion (full-thickness cartilage loss, specifically).

| **[Continual Domain Incremental Learning for Privacy-aware Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06455v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the field of digital pathology, driven by the ability to model complex tissue patterns using advanced deep-learning algorithms. However, the robustness of these models is often severely compromised in the presence of data shifts (e.g., different stains, organs, centers, etc.). Alternatively, continual learning (CL) techniques aim to reduce the forgetting of past data when learning new data with distributional shift conditions. Specifically, rehearsal-based CL techniques, which store some past data in a buffer and then replay it with new data, have proven effective in medical image analysis tasks. However, privacy concerns arise as these approaches store past data, prompting the development of our novel Generative Latent Replay-based CL (GLRCL) approach. GLRCL captures the previous distribution through Gaussian Mixture Models instead of storing past samples, which are then utilized to generate features and perform latent replay with new data. We systematically evaluate our proposed framework under different shift conditions in histopathology data, including stain and organ shift. Our approach significantly outperforms popular buffer-free CL approaches and performs similarly to rehearsal-based CL approaches that require large buffers causing serious privacy violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in MICCAI 2024</p></details> | None |

Numerous existing solutions, predominantly CNN-based, face issues related to a lack of global contextual understanding. Alternatively, some approaches resort to large-scale Transformer models to bridge the global contextual gaps, but at the expense of model size and computational complexity. Finally many Transformer based approaches rely primarily on CNN based decoders overlooking the benefits of Transformer based decoding models. Recognizing these limitations, we address the need efficient lightweight solutions by introducing MobileUNETR, which aims to overcome the performance constraints associated with both CNNs and Transformers while minimizing model size, presenting a promising stride towards efficient image segmentation. MobileUNETR has 3 main features. 1) MobileUNETR comprises of a lightweight hybrid CNN-Transformer encoder to help balance local and global contextual feature extraction in an efficient manner; 2) A novel hybrid decoder that simultaneously utilizes low-level and global features at different resolutions within the decoding stage for accurate mask generation; 3) surpassing large and complex architectures, MobileUNETR achieves superior performance with 3 million parameters and a computational complexity of 1.3 GFLOP resulting in 10x and 23x reduction in parameters and FLOPS, respectively. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on four publicly available skin lesion segmentation datasets, including ISIC 2016, ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets.

| **[Enhancing the vision-language foundation model with key semantic knowledge-emphasized report refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11421v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language representation learning has made remarkable advancements in building up medical foundation models, holding immense potential for transforming the landscape of clinical research and medical care. The underlying hypothesis is that the rich knowledge embedded in radiology reports can effectively assist and guide the learning process, reducing the need for additional labels. However, these reports tend to be complex and sometimes even consist of redundant descriptions that make the representation learning too challenging to capture the key semantic information. This paper develops a novel iterative vision-language representation learning framework by proposing a key semantic knowledge-emphasized report refinement method. Particularly, raw radiology reports are refined to highlight the key information according to a constructed clinical dictionary and two model-optimized knowledge-enhancement metrics. The iterative framework is designed to progressively learn, starting from gaining a general understanding of the patient's condition based on raw reports and gradually refines and extracts critical information essential to the fine-grained analysis tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on various downstream medical image analysis tasks, including disease classification, region-of-interest segmentation, and phrase grounding. Our framework surpasses seven state-of-the-art methods in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, demonstrating its encouraging potential for different clinical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly multimodal models like ChatGPT, have shown promise in transforming medical image analysis through capabilities such as medical vision-language question answering. However, there remains a significant gap in integrating pathology image data with these AI models for clinical applications. This study benchmarks the performance of GPT on pathology images, assessing their diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in real-word clinical records. We observe significant deficits of GPT in bone diseases and a fair-level performance in diseases from other three systems. Despite offering satisfactory abnormality annotations, GPT exhibits consistent disadvantage in terminology accuracy and multimodal integration. Specifically, we demonstrate GPT's failures in interpreting immunohistochemistry results and diagnosing metastatic cancers. This study highlight the weakness of current generalist GPT model and contribute to the integration of pathology and advanced AI.</p></details> |  | None |

While these models offer great opportunities, they still face crucial challenges, such as the requirement for fine-grained knowledge understanding in computer-aided diagnosis and the capability of utilizing very limited or even no task-specific labeled data in real-world clinical applications. In this study, we present MaCo, a masked contrastive chest X-ray foundation model that tackles these challenges. MaCo explores masked contrastive learning to simultaneously achieve fine-grained image understanding and zero-shot learning for a variety of medical imaging tasks. It designs a correlation weighting mechanism to adjust the correlation between masked chest X-ray image patches and their corresponding reports, thereby enhancing the model's representation learning capabilities. To evaluate the performance of MaCo, we conducted extensive experiments using 6 well-known open-source X-ray datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MaCo over 10 state-of-the-art approaches across tasks such as classification, segmentation, detection, and phrase grounding. These findings highlight the significant potential of MaCo in advancing a wide range of medical image analysis tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This necessitates effective dataset compression techniques to reduce storage, transmission, and computational cost. However, existing coreset selection methods are primarily designed for natural image datasets, and exhibit doubtful effectiveness when applied to medical image datasets due to challenges such as intra-class variation and inter-class similarity. In this paper, we propose a novel coreset selection strategy termed as Evolution-aware VAriance (EVA), which captures the evolutionary process of model training through a dual-window approach and reflects the fluctuation of sample importance more precisely through variance measurement. Extensive experiments on medical image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy over previous SOTA methods, especially at high compression rates. EVA achieves 98.27% accuracy with only 10% training data, compared to 97.20% for the full training set. None of the compared baseline methods can exceed Random at 5% selection rate, while EVA outperforms Random by 5.61%, showcasing its potential for efficient medical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024 (oral), see: https://openreview.net/forum?id=m1qrB9KSYD</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose ViP, a novel visual symptom-guided prompt learning framework for medical image analysis, which facilitates general knowledge transfer from CLIP. ViP consists of two key components: a visual symptom generator (VSG) and a dual-prompt network. Specifically, VSG aims to extract explicable visual symptoms from pre-trained large language models, while the dual-prompt network utilizes these visual symptoms to guide the training on two learnable prompt modules, i.e., context prompt and merge prompt, which effectively adapts our framework to medical image analysis via large VLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ViP can outperform state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluating Reliability in Medical DNNs: A Critical Analysis of Feature and Confidence-Based OOD Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17337v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for medical image analysis requires methods to identify inputs that differ significantly from the training data, called out-of-distribution (OOD), to prevent erroneous predictions. OOD detection methods can be categorised as either confidence-based (using the model's output layer for OOD detection) or feature-based (not using the output layer). We created two new OOD benchmarks by dividing the D7P (dermatology) and BreastMNIST (ultrasound) datasets into subsets which either contain or don't contain an artefact (rulers or annotations respectively). Models were trained with artefact-free images, and images with the artefacts were used as OOD test sets. For each OOD image, we created a counterfactual by manually removing the artefact via image processing, to assess the artefact's impact on the model's predictions. We show that OOD artefacts can boost a model's softmax confidence in its predictions, due to correlations in training data among other factors. This contradicts the common assumption that OOD artefacts should lead to more uncertain outputs, an assumption on which most confidence-based methods rely. We use this to explain why feature-based methods (e.g. Mahalanobis score) typically have greater OOD detection performance than confidence-based methods (e.g. MCP). However, we also show that feature-based methods typically perform worse at distinguishing between inputs that lead to correct and incorrect predictions (for both OOD and ID data). Following from these insights, we argue that a combination of feature-based and confidence-based methods should be used within DNN pipelines to mitigate their respective weaknesses. These project's code and OOD benchmarks are available at: https://github.com/HarryAnthony/Evaluating_OOD_detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the Uncertainty for Safe Utilization of Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (UNSURE 2024) workshop at the MICCAI 2023</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/HarryAnthony/Evaluating_OOD_detection) |
| **[PromptSmooth: Certifying Robustness of Medical Vision-Language Models via Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16769v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) trained on large datasets of medical image-text pairs and later fine-tuned for specific tasks have emerged as a mainstream paradigm in medical image analysis. However, recent studies have highlighted the susceptibility of these Med-VLMs to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their safety and robustness. Randomized smoothing is a well-known technique for turning any classifier into a model that is certifiably robust to adversarial perturbations. However, this approach requires retraining the Med-VLM-based classifier so that it classifies well under Gaussian noise, which is often infeasible in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called PromptSmooth to achieve efficient certified robustness of Med-VLMs by leveraging the concept of prompt learning. Given any pre-trained Med-VLM, PromptSmooth adapts it to handle Gaussian noise by learning textual prompts in a zero-shot or few-shot manner, achieving a delicate balance between accuracy and robustness, while minimizing the computational overhead. Moreover, PromptSmooth requires only a single model to handle multiple noise levels, which substantially reduces the computational cost compared to traditional methods that rely on training a separate model for each noise level. Comprehensive experiments based on three Med-VLMs and across six downstream datasets of various imaging modalities demonstrate the efficacy of PromptSmooth.

| **[Pre-training Everywhere: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Medical Image Analysis via Target Parameter Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15011v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged to address issues of overfitting and high computational costs associated with fully fine-tuning in the paradigm of self-supervised learning. Mainstream methods based on PEFT involve adding a few trainable parameters while keeping the pre-trained parameters of the backbone fixed. These methods achieve comparative, and often superior, performance to fully fine-tuning, demonstrating the powerful representation ability of the pre-trained backbone. Despite its success, these methods typically ignore the initialization of the new parameters, often relying solely on random initialization. We argue that if pre-training is significantly beneficial, it should be applied to all parameters requiring representational capacity. Motivated by this insight, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning framework based on Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP). The target parameters refer to the new parameters introduced during fine-tuning. TPP includes an additional stage before PEFT to pre-train these target parameters. During this stage, the pre-trained backbone parameters are frozen, and only the target parameters are trainable. A defined pre-text task is used to encourage the target parameters to learn specific representations of downstream data. When PEFT is subsequently employed, the pre-trained target parameters are loaded to enhance fine-tuning efficiency. The proposed TPP framework is versatile, allowing for the integration of various pretext tasks for pre-training and supporting different PEFT methods as backbones. We evaluated the fine-tining performance of our method using five public datasets, including three modalities and two task types. The results demonstrate that the proposed TPP can be easily integrated into existing PEFT methods, significantly improving performance.</p></details> |  | None |
