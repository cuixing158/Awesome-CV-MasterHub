| **[Vision Transformers on the Edge: A Comprehensive Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02891v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful and promising techniques for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire further research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient deployment on edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Q-DiT: Accurate Post-Training Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17343v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the architectural transformation from UNet-based models to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), significantly improve the quality and scalability of image and video generation. However, despite their impressive capabilities, the substantial computational costs of these large-scale models pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution, enabling model compression and accelerated inference for pretrained models, without the costly retraining. However, research on DiT quantization remains sparse, and existing PTQ frameworks, primarily designed for traditional diffusion models, tend to suffer from biased quantization, leading to notable performance degradation. In this work, we identify that DiTs typically exhibit significant spatial variance in both weights and activations, along with temporal variance in activations. To address these issues, we propose Q-DiT, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates two key techniques: automatic quantization granularity allocation to handle the significant variance of weights and activations across input channels, and sample-wise dynamic activation quantization to adaptively capture activation changes across both timesteps and samples. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and VBench demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-DiT. Specifically, when quantizing DiT-XL/2 to W6A8 on ImageNet ($256 \times 256$), Q-DiT achieves a remarkable reduction in FID by 1.09 compared to the baseline. Under the more challenging W4A8 setting, it maintains high fidelity in image and video generation, establishing a new benchmark for efficient, high-quality quantization in DiTs.

| **[Model Compression and Efficient Inference for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09748v1)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer based large language models have achieved tremendous success. However, the significant memory and computational costs incurred during the inference process make it challenging to deploy large models on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we investigate compression and efficient inference methods for large language models from an algorithmic perspective. Regarding taxonomy, similar to smaller models, compression and acceleration algorithms for large language models can still be categorized into quantization, pruning, distillation, compact architecture design, dynamic networks. However, Large language models have two prominent characteristics compared to smaller models: (1) Most of compression algorithms require finetuning or even retraining the model after compression. The most notable aspect of large models is the very high cost associated with model finetuning or training. Therefore, many algorithms for large models, such as quantization and pruning, start to explore tuning-free algorithms. (2) Large models emphasize versatility and generalization rather than performance on a single task. Hence, many algorithms, such as knowledge distillation, focus on how to preserving their versatility and generalization after compression. Since these two characteristics were not very pronounced in early large models, we further distinguish large language models into medium models and ``real'' large models. Additionally, we also provide an introduction to some mature frameworks for efficient inference of large models, which can support basic compression or acceleration algorithms, greatly facilitating model deployment for users.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, review 380 papers.

Since published in ISCA'16, it opened a new design space to accelerate pruned and sparse neural networks and spawned many algorithm-hardware co-designs for model compression and acceleration, both in academia and commercial AI chips. In retrospect, we review the background of this project, summarize the pros and cons, and discuss new opportunities where pruning, sparsity, and low precision can accelerate emerging deep learning workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Invit...</summary><p>Invited retrospective paper at ISCA 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[A Survey on Model Compression and Acceleration for Pretrained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07105v2)** | 2022-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks, the high energy cost and long inference delay prevent Transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs) from seeing broader adoption including for edge and mobile computing. Efficient NLP research aims to comprehensively consider computation, time and carbon emission for the entire life-cycle of NLP, including data preparation, model training and inference. In this survey, we focus on the inference stage and review the current state of model compression and acceleration for pretrained language models, including benchmarks, metrics and methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2023</p></details> | None |
