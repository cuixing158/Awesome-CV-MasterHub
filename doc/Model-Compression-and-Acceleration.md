| **[Q-DiT: Accurate Post-Training Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17343v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the architectural transformation from UNet-based models to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), significantly improve the quality and scalability of image and video generation. However, despite their impressive capabilities, the substantial computational costs of these large-scale models pose significant challenges for real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution, enabling model compression and accelerated inference for pretrained models, without the costly retraining. However, research on DiT quantization remains sparse, and existing PTQ frameworks, primarily designed for traditional diffusion models, tend to suffer from biased quantization, leading to notable performance degradation. In this work, we identify that DiTs typically exhibit significant spatial variance in both weights and activations, along with temporal variance in activations. To address these issues, we propose Q-DiT, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates two key techniques: automatic quantization granularity allocation to handle the significant variance of weights and activations across input channels, and sample-wise dynamic activation quantization to adaptively capture activation changes across both timesteps and samples. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and VBench demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-DiT. Specifically, when quantizing DiT-XL/2 to W6A8 on ImageNet ($256 \times 256$), Q-DiT achieves a remarkable reduction in FID by 1.09 compared to the baseline. Under the more challenging W4A8 setting, it maintains high fidelity in image and video generation, establishing a new benchmark for efficient, high-quality quantization in DiTs.

| **[Model Compression and Efficient Inference for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09748v1)** | 2024-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer based large language models have achieved tremendous success. However, the significant memory and computational costs incurred during the inference process make it challenging to deploy large models on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we investigate compression and efficient inference methods for large language models from an algorithmic perspective. Regarding taxonomy, similar to smaller models, compression and acceleration algorithms for large language models can still be categorized into quantization, pruning, distillation, compact architecture design, dynamic networks. However, Large language models have two prominent characteristics compared to smaller models: (1) Most of compression algorithms require finetuning or even retraining the model after compression. The most notable aspect of large models is the very high cost associated with model finetuning or training. Therefore, many algorithms for large models, such as quantization and pruning, start to explore tuning-free algorithms. (2) Large models emphasize versatility and generalization rather than performance on a single task. Hence, many algorithms, such as knowledge distillation, focus on how to preserving their versatility and generalization after compression. Since these two characteristics were not very pronounced in early large models, we further distinguish large language models into medium models and ``real'' large models. Additionally, we also provide an introduction to some mature frameworks for efficient inference of large models, which can support basic compression or acceleration algorithms, greatly facilitating model deployment for users.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, review 380 papers.

| **[Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks on Raspberry Pi for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00943v4)** | 2022-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the good performance of deep learning algorithms in the field of computer vision (CV), the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture has become a main backbone of the computer vision task. With the widespread use of mobile devices, neural network models based on platforms with low computing power are gradually being paid attention. However, due to the limitation of computing power, deep learning algorithms are usually not available on mobile devices. This paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network, TripleNet, which can operate easily on Raspberry Pi. Adopted from the concept of block connections in ThreshNet, the newly proposed network model compresses and accelerates the network model, reduces the amount of parameters of the network, and shortens the inference time of each image while ensuring the accuracy. Our proposed TripleNet and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) neural networks perform image classification experiments with the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets on Raspberry Pi. The experimental results show that, compared with GhostNet, MobileNet, ThreshNet, EfficientNet, and HarDNet, the inference time of TripleNet per image is shortened by 15%, 16%, 17%, 24%, and 30%, respectively.

| **[Sub-network Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Filter Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01957v1)** | 2022-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filter pruning is a common method to achieve model compression and acceleration in deep neural networks (DNNs).Some research regarded filter pruning as a combinatorial optimization problem and thus used evolutionary algorithms (EA) to prune filters of DNNs. However, it is difficult to find a satisfactory compromise solution in a reasonable time due to the complexity of solution space searching. To solve this problem, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization problem based on a sub-network of the full model and propose a Sub-network Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (SMOEA) for filter pruning. By progressively pruning the convolutional layers in groups, SMOEA can obtain a lightweight pruned result with better performance.Experiments on VGG-14 model for CIFAR-10 verify the effectiveness of the proposed SMOEA. Specifically, the accuracy of the pruned model with 16.56% parameters decreases by 0.28% only, which is better than the widely used popular filter pruning criteria.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Model Blending for Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02819v1)** | 2022-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven successful in a wide variety of applications such as speech recognition and synthesis, computer vision, machine translation, and game playing, to name but a few. However, existing deep neural network models are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their deployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict latency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model compression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing the model performance, which is what we call reducing the complexity. In the following work, we try reducing the complexity of state of the art LSTM models for natural language tasks such as text classification, by distilling their knowledge to CNN based models, thus reducing the inference time(or latency) during testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Masters thesis. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1803.01271, arXiv:1710.09282 by other authors</p></details> | None |
| **[Distilling Object Detectors with Feature Richness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00674v4)** | 2021-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large-scale deep models have achieved great success, but the huge computational complexity and massive storage requirements make it a great challenge to deploy them in resource-limited devices. As a model compression and acceleration method, knowledge distillation effectively improves the performance of small models by transferring the dark knowledge from the teacher detector. However, most of the existing distillation-based detection methods mainly imitating features near bounding boxes, which suffer from two limitations. First, they ignore the beneficial features outside the bounding boxes. Second, these methods imitate some features which are mistakenly regarded as the background by the teacher detector. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Feature-Richness Score (FRS) method to choose important features that improve generalized detectability during distilling. The proposed method effectively retrieves the important features outside the bounding boxes and removes the detrimental features within the bounding boxes. Extensive experiments show that our methods achieve excellent performance on both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. For example, RetinaNet with ResNet-50 achieves 39.7% in mAP on the COCO2017 dataset, which even surpasses the ResNet-101 based teacher detector 38.9% by 0.8%. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/duzhixing/FRS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2021</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/duzhixing/FRS) |
| **[Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection via Rank Mimicking and Prediction-guided Feature Imitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04840v1)** | 2021-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely-used technology to inherit information from cumbersome teacher models to compact student models, consequently realizing model compression and acceleration. Compared with image classification, object detection is a more complex task, and designing specific KD methods for object detection is non-trivial. In this work, we elaborately study the behaviour difference between the teacher and student detection models, and obtain two intriguing observations: First, the teacher and student rank their detected candidate boxes quite differently, which results in their precision discrepancy. Second, there is a considerable gap between the feature response differences and prediction differences between teacher and student, indicating that equally imitating all the feature maps of the teacher is the sub-optimal choice for improving the student's accuracy. Based on the two observations, we propose Rank Mimicking (RM) and Prediction-guided Feature Imitation (PFI) for distilling one-stage detectors, respectively. RM takes the rank of candidate boxes from teachers as a new form of knowledge to distill, which consistently outperforms the traditional soft label distillation. PFI attempts to correlate feature differences with prediction differences, making feature imitation directly help to improve the student's accuracy. On MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks, extensive experiments are conducted on various detectors with different backbones to validate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, RetinaNet with ResNet50 achieves 40.4% mAP in MS COCO, which is 3.5% higher than its baseline, and also outperforms previous KD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2022</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning Interpretation with Explainable Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06945v1)** | 2021-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been considered as a key solution in model compression and acceleration in recent years. In KD, a small student model is generally trained from a large teacher model by minimizing the divergence between the probabilistic outputs of the two. However, as demonstrated in our experiments, existing KD methods might not transfer critical explainable knowledge of the teacher to the student, i.e. the explanations of predictions made by the two models are not consistent. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable knowledge distillation model, called XDistillation, through which both the performance the explanations' information are transferred from the teacher model to the student model. The XDistillation model leverages the idea of convolutional autoencoders to approximate the teacher explanations. Our experiments shows that models trained by XDistillation outperform those trained by conventional KD methods not only in term of predictive accuracy but also faithfulness to the teacher models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE BigData 2021</p></details> | None |
