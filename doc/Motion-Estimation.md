| **[EMoTive: Event-guided Trajectory Modeling for 3D Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11371v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual 3D motion estimation aims to infer the motion of 2D pixels in 3D space based on visual cues. The key challenge arises from depth variation induced spatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local spatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks. In contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation through continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper presents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal trajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively characterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we first introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a continuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to encode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation, we introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal features under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve parameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The final 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of parametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce CarlaEvent3D, a multi-dynamic synthetic dataset for comprehensive validation. Extensive experiments on both this dataset and a real-world benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[U-Motion: Learned Point Cloud Video Compression with U-Structured Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14501v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud video (PCV) is a versatile 3D representation of dynamic scenes with emerging applications. This paper introduces U-Motion, a learning-based compression scheme for both PCV geometry and attributes. We propose a U-Structured inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates Top-Down (Fine-to-Coarse) Motion Propagation, Bottom-Up Motion Predictive Coding and Multi-scale Group Motion Compensation to enable accurate motion estimation and efficient motion compression at each scale. In addition, we design a multi-scale spatial-temporal predictive coding module to capture the cross-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition for dense dynamic point clouds and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Residual Learning and Filtering Networks for End-to-End Lossless Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08819v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing learning-based video compression methods still face challenges related to inaccurate motion estimates and inadequate motion compensation structures. These issues result in compression errors and a suboptimal rate-distortion trade-off. To address these challenges, this work presents an end-to-end video compression method that incorporates several key operations. Specifically, we propose an autoencoder-type network with a residual skip connection to efficiently compress motion information. Additionally, we design motion vector and residual frame filtering networks to mitigate compression errors in the video compression system. To improve the effectiveness of the motion compensation network, we utilize powerful nonlinear transforms, such as the Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU), to delve deeper into the motion compensation architecture. Furthermore, a buffer is introduced to fine-tune the previous reference frames, thereby enhancing the reconstructed frame quality. These modules are combined with a carefully designed loss function that assesses the trade-off and enhances the overall video quality of the decoded output. Experimental results showcase the competitive performance of our method on various datasets, including HEVC (sequences B, C, and D), UVG, VTL, and MCL-JCV. The proposed approach tackles the challenges of accurate motion estimation and motion compensation in video compression, and the results highlight its competitive performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ArticulatedGS: Self-supervised Digital Twin Modeling of Articulated Objects using 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08135v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the challenge of concurrent reconstruction at the part level with the RGB appearance and estimation of motion parameters for building digital twins of articulated objects using the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) method. With two distinct sets of multi-view imagery, each depicting an object in separate static articulation configurations, we reconstruct the articulated object in 3D Gaussian representations with both appearance and geometry information at the same time. Our approach decoupled multiple highly interdependent parameters through a multi-step optimization process, thereby achieving a stable optimization procedure and high-quality outcomes. We introduce ArticulatedGS, a self-supervised, comprehensive framework that autonomously learns to model shapes and appearances at the part level and synchronizes the optimization of motion parameters, all without reliance on 3D supervision, motion cues, or semantic labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that, among comparable methodologies, our approach has achieved optimal outcomes in terms of part segmentation accuracy, motion estimation accuracy, and visual quality.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SIRE: SE(3) Intrinsic Rigidity Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07739v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion serves as a powerful cue for scene perception and understanding by separating independently moving surfaces and organizing the physical world into distinct entities. We introduce SIRE, a self-supervised method for motion discovery of objects and dynamic scene reconstruction from casual scenes by learning intrinsic rigidity embeddings from videos. Our method trains an image encoder to estimate scene rigidity and geometry, supervised by a simple 4D reconstruction loss: a least-squares solver uses the estimated geometry and rigidity to lift 2D point track trajectories into SE(3) tracks, which are simply re-projected back to 2D and compared against the original 2D trajectories for supervision. Crucially, our framework is fully end-to-end differentiable and can be optimized either on video datasets to learn generalizable image priors, or even on a single video to capture scene-specific structure - highlighting strong data efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our rigidity embeddings and geometry across multiple settings, including downstream object segmentation, SE(3) rigid motion estimation, and self-supervised depth estimation. Our findings suggest that SIRE can learn strong geometry and motion rigidity priors from video data, with minimal supervision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ReynoldsFlow: Exquisite Flow Estimation via Reynolds Transport Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04500v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow is a fundamental technique for motion estimation, widely applied in video stabilization, interpolation, and object tracking. Traditional optical flow estimation methods rely on restrictive assumptions like brightness constancy and slow motion constraints. Recent deep learning-based flow estimations require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) advances have enabled deep learning models to take advantage of optical flow as an important feature for object tracking and motion analysis. Since optical flow is commonly encoded in HSV for visualization, its conversion to RGB for neural network processing is nonlinear and may introduce perceptual distortions. These transformations amplify the sensitivity to estimation errors, potentially affecting the predictive accuracy of the networks. To address these challenges that are influential to the performance of downstream network models, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. In addition to conventional HSV-based visualization of Reynolds flow, we also introduce an RGB-encoded representation of Reynolds flow designed to improve flow visualization and feature enhancement for neural networks. We evaluated the effectiveness of Reynolds flow in video-based tasks. Experimental results on three benchmarks, tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB, demonstrate that networks trained with RGB-encoded Reynolds flow achieve SOTA performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Implicit Neural Representation for Video and Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04665v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach for super-resolution that utilizes implicit neural representation (INR) to effectively reconstruct and enhance low-resolution videos and images. By leveraging the capacity of neural networks to implicitly encode spatial and temporal features, our method facilitates high-resolution reconstruction using only low-resolution inputs and a 3D high-resolution grid. This results in an efficient solution for both image and video super-resolution. Our proposed method, SR-INR, maintains consistent details across frames and images, achieving impressive temporal stability without relying on the computationally intensive optical flow or motion estimation typically used in other video super-resolution techniques. The simplicity of our approach contrasts with the complexity of many existing methods, making it both effective and efficient. Experimental evaluations show that SR-INR delivers results on par with or superior to state-of-the-art super-resolution methods, while maintaining a more straightforward structure and reduced computational demands. These findings highlight the potential of implicit neural representations as a powerful tool for reconstructing high-quality, temporally consistent video and image signals from low-resolution data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Geometry-Constrained Monocular Scale Estimation Using Semantic Segmentation for Dynamic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04235v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular visual localization plays a pivotal role in advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving by estimating a vehicle's ego-motion from a single pinhole camera. Nevertheless, conventional monocular visual odometry encoun-ters challenges in scale estimation due to the absence of depth information during projection. Previous methodologies, whether rooted in physical constraints or deep learning paradigms, con-tend with issues related to computational complexity and the management of dynamic objects. This study extends our prior research, presenting innovative strategies for ego-motion estima-tion and the selection of ground points. Striving for a nuanced equilibrium between computational efficiency and precision, we propose a hybrid method that leverages the SegNeXt model for real-time applications, encompassing both ego-motion estimation and ground point selection. Our methodology incorporates dy-namic object masks to eliminate unstable features and employs ground plane masks for meticulous triangulation. Furthermore, we exploit Geometry-constraint to delineate road regions for scale recovery. The integration of this approach with the mo-nocular version of ORB-SLAM3 culminates in the accurate esti-mation of a road model, a pivotal component in our scale recov-ery process. Rigorous experiments, conducted on the KITTI da-taset, systematically compare our method with existing monocu-lar visual odometry algorithms and contemporary scale recovery methodologies. The results undeniably confirm the superior ef-fectiveness of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms.
