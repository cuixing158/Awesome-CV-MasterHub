We introduce DELTA, a novel method that efficiently tracks every pixel in 3D space, enabling accurate motion estimation across entire videos. Our approach leverages a joint global-local attention mechanism for reduced-resolution tracking, followed by a transformer-based upsampler to achieve high-resolution predictions. Unlike existing methods, which are limited by computational inefficiency or sparse tracking, DELTA delivers dense 3D tracking at scale, running over 8x faster than previous methods while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the impact of depth representation on tracking performance and identify log-depth as the optimal choice. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DELTA on multiple benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both 2D and 3D dense tracking tasks. Our method provides a robust solution for applications requiring fine-grained, long-term motion tracking in 3D space.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

To address these challenges, we propose an Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)-guided visual odometry with selective online adaptation named ORB-SfMLearner. We present a novel use of ORB features for learning-based ego-motion estimation, leading to more robust and accurate results. We also introduce the cross-attention mechanism to enhance the explainability of PoseNet and have revealed that driving direction of the vehicle can be explained through the attention weights. To improve generalizability, our selective online adaptation allows the network to rapidly and selectively adjust to the optimal parameters across different domains. Experimental results on KITTI and vKITTI datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep visual odometry methods in terms of ego-motion accuracy and generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025; Project page: https://www.neiljin.site/projects/orbsfm/</p></details> | None |
| **[Active Illumination for Visual Ego-Motion Estimation in the Dark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13708v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) systems often struggle in low-light and dark environments due to the lack of robust visual features. In this paper, we propose a novel active illumination framework to enhance the performance of VO and V-SLAM algorithms in these challenging conditions. The developed approach dynamically controls a moving light source to illuminate highly textured areas, thereby improving feature extraction and tracking. Specifically, a detector block, which incorporates a deep learning-based enhancing network, identifies regions with relevant features. Then, a pan-tilt controller is responsible for guiding the light beam toward these areas, so that to provide information-rich images to the ego-motion estimation algorithm. Experimental results on a real robotic platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing a reduction in the pose estimation error up to 75% with respect to a traditional fixed lighting technique.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DynoSAM: Open-Source Smoothing and Mapping Framework for Dynamic SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11893v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) systems focus solely on static scene structures, overlooking dynamic elements in the environment. Although effective for accurate visual odometry in complex scenarios, these methods discard crucial information about moving objects. By incorporating this information into a Dynamic SLAM framework, the motion of dynamic entities can be estimated, enhancing navigation whilst ensuring accurate localization. However, the fundamental formulation of Dynamic SLAM remains an open challenge, with no consensus on the optimal approach for accurate motion estimation within a SLAM pipeline. Therefore, we developed DynoSAM, an open-source framework for Dynamic SLAM that enables the efficient implementation, testing, and comparison of various Dynamic SLAM optimization formulations. DynoSAM integrates static and dynamic measurements into a unified optimization problem solved using factor graphs, simultaneously estimating camera poses, static scene, object motion or poses, and object structures. We evaluate DynoSAM across diverse simulated and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art motion estimation in indoor and outdoor environments, with substantial improvements over existing systems. Additionally, we demonstrate DynoSAM utility in downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes and trajectory prediction, thereby showcasing potential for advancing dynamic object-aware SLAM systems.

| **[A Cooperative Bearing-Rate Approach for Observability-Enhanced Target Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08089v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based target motion estimation is a fundamental problem in many robotic tasks. The existing methods have the limitation of low observability and, hence, face challenges in tracking highly maneuverable targets. Motivated by the aerial target pursuit task where a target may maneuver in 3D space, this paper studies how to further enhance observability by incorporating the \emph{bearing rate} information that has not been well explored in the literature. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new cooperative estimator called STT-R (Spatial-Temporal Triangulation with bearing Rate), which is designed under the framework of distributed recursive least squares. This theoretical result is further verified by numerical simulation and real-world experiments. It is shown that the proposed STT-R algorithm can effectively generate more accurate estimations and effectively reduce the lag in velocity estimation, enabling tracking of more maneuverable targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by icra 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Optimal Spatial-Temporal Triangulation for Bearing-Only Cooperative Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15846v5)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based cooperative motion estimation is an important problem for many multi-robot systems such as cooperative aerial target pursuit. This problem can be formulated as bearing-only cooperative motion estimation, where the visual measurement is modeled as a bearing vector pointing from the camera to the target. The conventional approaches for bearing-only cooperative estimation are mainly based on the framework distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). In this paper, we propose a new optimal bearing-only cooperative estimation algorithm, named spatial-temporal triangulation, based on the method of distributed recursive least squares, which provides a more flexible framework for designing distributed estimators than DKF. The design of the algorithm fully incorporates all the available information and the specific triangulation geometric constraint. As a result, the algorithm has superior estimation performance than the state-of-the-art DKF algorithms in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed as verified by numerical simulation. We rigorously prove the exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under practical challenging conditions, we develop a vision-based cooperative aerial target pursuit system, which is the first of such fully autonomous systems so far to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Automatica</p></details> | None |

In recent years, the availability of customer-level 360 cameras has made omnidirectional vision more popular, and the advance of deep learning (DL) has significantly sparked its research and applications. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review and analysis of the recent progress of DL for omnidirectional vision.

Our system combines a single LiDAR with expandable moving cameras, allowing for flexible and precise motion estimation in a unified world coordinate. In particular, We introduce a local-to-global pose-aware cross-sensor human-matching module that predicts the alignment among each sensor, even in the absence of calibration. Additionally, our coarse-to-fine sensor-expandable pose optimizer further optimizes the 3D human key points and the alignments, it is also capable of incorporating additional cameras to enhance accuracy. Extensive experiments on Human-M3 and FreeMotion datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-modal methods, offering an expandable and efficient solution for multi-person motion capture across various applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Low Resource Video Super-resolution using Memory and Residual Deformable Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01816v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based video super-resolution (VSR) models have set new benchmarks in recent years, but their substantial computational demands make most of them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Achieving a balance between model complexity and output quality remains a formidable challenge in VSR. Although lightweight models have been introduced to address this issue, they often struggle to deliver state-of-the-art performance. We propose a novel lightweight, parameter-efficient deep residual deformable convolution network for VSR. Unlike prior methods, our model enhances feature utilization through residual connections and employs deformable convolution for precise frame alignment, addressing motion dynamics effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a single memory tensor to capture information accrued from the past frames and improve motion estimation across frames. This design enables an efficient balance between computational cost and reconstruction quality. With just 2.3 million parameters, our model achieves state-of-the-art SSIM of 0.9175 on the REDS4 dataset, surpassing existing lightweight and many heavy models in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Architectural insights from our model pave the way for real-time VSR on streaming data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Video Neural Network Processing Based on Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15119v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video neural network (VNN) processing using the conventional pipeline first converts Bayer video information into human understandable RGB videos using image signal processing (ISP) on a pixel by pixel basis. Then, VNN processing is performed on a frame by frame basis. Both ISP and VNN are computationally expensive with high power consumption and latency. In this paper, we propose an efficient VNN processing framework. Instead of using ISP, computer vision tasks are directly accomplished using Bayer pattern information. To accelerate VNN processing, motion estimation is introduced to find temporal redundancies in input video data so as to avoid repeated and unnecessary computations. Experiments show greater than 67\% computation reduction, while maintaining computer vision task accuracy for typical computer vision tasks and data sets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scalable Benchmarking and Robust Learning for Noise-Free Ego-Motion and 3D Reconstruction from Noisy Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14319v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to redefine robust ego-motion estimation and photorealistic 3D reconstruction by addressing a critical limitation: the reliance on noise-free data in existing models. While such sanitized conditions simplify evaluation, they fail to capture the unpredictable, noisy complexities of real-world environments. Dynamic motion, sensor imperfections, and synchronization perturbations lead to sharp performance declines when these models are deployed in practice, revealing an urgent need for frameworks that embrace and excel under real-world noise. To bridge this gap, we tackle three core challenges: scalable data generation, comprehensive benchmarking, and model robustness enhancement. First, we introduce a scalable noisy data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse datasets simulating complex motion, sensor imperfections, and synchronization errors. Second, we leverage this pipeline to create Robust-Ego3D, a benchmark rigorously designed to expose noise-induced performance degradation, highlighting the limitations of current learning-based methods in ego-motion accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Third, we propose Correspondence-guided Gaussian Splatting (CorrGS), a novel test-time adaptation method that progressively refines an internal clean 3D representation by aligning noisy observations with rendered RGB-D frames from clean 3D map, enhancing geometric alignment and appearance restoration through visual correspondence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that CorrGS consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios involving rapid motion and dynamic illumination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025; 92 Pages; Project Repo: https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/SLAM-under-Perturbation. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.16850</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/SLAM-under-Perturbation) |
| **[Efficient Dynamic Image Reconstruction with motion estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12497v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic inverse problems are challenging to solve due to the need to identify and incorporate appropriate regularization in both space and time. Moreover, the very large scale nature of such problems in practice presents an enormous computational challenge. In this work, in addition to the use of edge-enhancing regularization of spatial features, we propose a new regularization method that incorporates a temporal model that estimates the motion of objects in time. In particular, we consider the optical flow model that simultaneously estimates the motion and provides an approximation for the desired image, and we incorporate this information into the cost functional as an additional form of temporal regularization. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm to solve the jointly regularized problem that leverages a generalized Krylov subspace method. We illustrate the effectiveness of the prescribed approach on a wide range of numerical experiments, including limited angle and single-shot computerized tomography.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[TOFFE -- Temporally-binned Object Flow from Events for High-speed and Energy-Efficient Object Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12482v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection and tracking is an essential perception task for enabling fully autonomous navigation in robotic systems. Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Event-based vision for egomotion estimation using precise event timing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11554v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egomotion estimation is crucial for applications such as autonomous navigation and robotics, where accurate and real-time motion tracking is required. However, traditional methods relying on inertial sensors are highly sensitive to external conditions, and suffer from drifts leading to large inaccuracies over long distances. Vision-based methods, particularly those utilising event-based vision sensors, provide an efficient alternative by capturing data only when changes are perceived in the scene. This approach minimises power consumption while delivering high-speed, low-latency feedback. In this work, we propose a fully event-based pipeline for egomotion estimation that processes the event stream directly within the event-based domain. This method eliminates the need for frame-based intermediaries, allowing for low-latency and energy-efficient motion estimation. We construct a shallow spiking neural network using a synaptic gating mechanism to convert precise event timing into bursts of spikes. These spikes encode local optical flow velocities, and the network provides an event-based readout of egomotion. We evaluate the network's performance on a dedicated chip, demonstrating strong potential for low-latency, low-power motion estimation. Additionally, simulations of larger networks show that the system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in egomotion estimation tasks with event-based cameras, making it a promising solution for real-time, power-constrained robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures.

| **[CorrDiff: Adaptive Delay-aware Detector with Temporal Cue Inputs for Real-time Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05132v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time object detection takes an essential part in the decision-making process of numerous real-world applications, including collision avoidance and path planning in autonomous driving systems. This paper presents a novel real-time streaming perception method named CorrDiff, designed to tackle the challenge of delays in real-time detection systems. The main contribution of CorrDiff lies in its adaptive delay-aware detector, which is able to utilize runtime-estimated temporal cues to predict objects' locations for multiple future frames, and selectively produce predictions that matches real-world time, effectively compensating for any communication and computational delays. The proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by leveraging motion estimation and feature enhancement, both for 1) single-frame detection for the current frame or the next frame, in terms of the metric mAP, and 2) the prediction for (multiple) future frame(s), in terms of the metric sAP (The sAP metric is to evaluate object detection algorithms in streaming scenarios, factoring in both latency and accuracy). It demonstrates robust performance across a range of devices, from powerful Tesla V100 to modest RTX 2080Ti, achieving the highest level of perceptual accuracy on all platforms. Unlike most state-of-the-art methods that struggle to complete computation within a single frame on less powerful devices, CorrDiff meets the stringent real-time processing requirements on all kinds of devices. The experimental results emphasize the system's adaptability and its potential to significantly improve the safety and reliability for many real-world systems, such as autonomous driving.

| **[NextStop: An Improved Tracker For Panoptic LIDAR Segmentation Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06235v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation is essential for scene understanding in autonomous driving and robotics ,combining semantic and instance segmentation with temporal consistency.Current methods, like 4D-PLS and 4D-STOP, use a tracking-by-detection methodology, employing deep learning networks to perform semantic and instance segmentation on each frame. To maintain temporal consistency, large-size instances detected in the current frame are compared and associated with instances within a temporal window that includes the current and preceding frames. However, their reliance on short-term instance detection, lack of motion estimation, and exclusion of small-sized instances lead to frequent identity switches and reduced tracking performance. We address these issues with the NextStop1 tracker, which integrates Kalman filter-based motion estimation, data association, and lifespan management, along with a tracklet state concept to improve prioritization. Evaluated using the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric on the SemanticKITTI validation set, NextStop demonstrated enhanced tracking performance, particularly for small-sized objects like people and bicyclists, with fewer ID switches, earlier tracking initiation, and improved reliability in complex environments.

While much progress has been made in capturing human-scene interaction in constrained environments, those prior methods can hardly reconstruct the natural and diverse human motion and scene context from web videos. In this work, we propose JOSH, a novel optimization-based method for 4D human-scene reconstruction in the wild from monocular videos. JOSH uses techniques in both dense scene reconstruction and human mesh recovery as initialization, and then it leverages the human-scene contact constraints to jointly optimize the scene, the camera poses, and the human motion. Experiment results show JOSH achieves better results on both global human motion estimation and dense scene reconstruction by joint optimization of scene geometry and human motion. We further design a more efficient model, JOSH3R, and directly train it with pseudo-labels from web videos. JOSH3R outperforms other optimization-free methods by only training with labels predicted from JOSH, further demonstrating its accuracy and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://genforce.github.io/JOSH/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://genforce.github.io/JOSH) |

However, precise calibration of the time offset between these two sensor types is a prerequisite for accurate and robust tracking. To address this, we propose a universal online temporal calibration strategy for optimization-based visual-inertial navigation systems. Technically, we incorporate the time offset td as a state parameter in the optimization residual model to align the IMU state to the corresponding image timestamp using td, angular velocity and translational velocity. This allows the temporal misalignment td to be optimized alongside other tracking states during the process. As our method only modifies the structure of the residual model, it can be applied to various optimization-based frameworks with different tracking frontends. We evaluate our calibration method with both EuRoC and simulation data and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate time offset estimation and faster convergence, particularly in the presence of noisy sensor data.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

Existing approaches primarily rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to infer novel-view videos, typically leading to issues such as limited diversity, spatial-temporal inconsistency and poor prompt alignment, due to the inherent randomness of SDS. To tackle these problems, we propose AR4D, a novel paradigm for SDS-free 4D generation. Specifically, our paradigm consists of three stages. To begin with, for a monocular video that is either generated or captured, we first utilize pre-trained expert models to create a 3D representation of the first frame, which is further fine-tuned to serve as the canonical space. Subsequently, motivated by the fact that videos happen naturally in an autoregressive manner, we propose to generate each frame's 3D representation based on its previous frame's representation, as this autoregressive generation manner can facilitate more accurate geometry and motion estimation. Meanwhile, to prevent overfitting during this process, we introduce a progressive view sampling strategy, utilizing priors from pre-trained large-scale 3D reconstruction models. To avoid appearance drift introduced by autoregressive generation, we further incorporate a refinement stage based on a global deformation field and the geometry of each frame's 3D representation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that AR4D can achieve state-of-the-art 4D generation without SDS, delivering greater diversity, improved spatial-temporal consistency, and better alignment with input prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: We present a novel method for 4D generation from monocular videos without relying on SDS, delivering greater diversity, improved spatial-temporal consistency, and better alignment with input prompts.

However, the collisions of the capsule endoscopies within the gastrointestinal tract cause vibration perturbations in the training data. Existing solutions focus solely on vision-based processing, neglecting other auxiliary signals like vibrations that could reduce noise and improve performance. Therefore, we propose V$^2$-SfMLearner, a multimodal approach integrating vibration signals into vision-based depth and capsule motion estimation for monocular capsule endoscopy. We construct a multimodal capsule endoscopy dataset containing vibration and visual signals, and our artificial intelligence solution develops an unsupervised method using vision-vibration signals, effectively eliminating vibration perturbations through multimodal learning. Specifically, we carefully design a vibration network branch and a Fourier fusion module, to detect and mitigate vibration noises. The fusion framework is compatible with popular vision-only algorithms. Extensive validation on the multimodal dataset demonstrates superior performance and robustness against vision-only algorithms. Without the need for large external equipment, our V$^2$-SfMLearner has the potential for integration into clinical capsule robots, providing real-time and dependable digestive examination tools. The findings show promise for practical implementation in clinical settings, enhancing the diagnostic capabilities of doctors.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering (IEEE TASE)</p></details> | None |
| **[A Plug-and-Play Physical Motion Restoration Approach for In-the-Wild High-Difficulty Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17377v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting physically plausible 3D human motion from videos is a critical task. Although existing simulation-based motion imitation methods can enhance the physical quality of daily motions estimated from monocular video capture, extending this capability to high-difficulty motions remains an open challenge. This can be attributed to some flawed motion clips in video-based motion capture results and the inherent complexity in modeling high-difficulty motions. Therefore, sensing the advantage of segmentation in localizing human body, we introduce a mask-based motion correction module (MCM) that leverages motion context and video mask to repair flawed motions, producing imitation-friendly motions; and propose a physics-based motion transfer module (PTM), which employs a pretrain and adapt approach for motion imitation, improving physical plausibility with the ability to handle in-the-wild and challenging motions. Our approach is designed as a plug-and-play module to physically refine the video motion capture results, including high-difficulty in-the-wild motions. Finally, to validate our approach, we collected a challenging in-the-wild test set to establish a benchmark, and our method has demonstrated effectiveness on both the new benchmark and existing public datasets.https://physicalmotionrestoration.github.io</p></details> |  | None |

Optical flow serves as a fundamental building block for various video-related tasks, such as video restoration, motion estimation, video stabilization, object tracking, action recognition, and video generation. While current state-of-the-art methods prioritize accuracy, they often overlook constraints regarding speed and memory usage. Existing light models typically focus on reducing size but still exhibit high latency, compromise significantly on quality, or are optimized for high-performance GPUs, resulting in sub-optimal performance on mobile devices. This study aims to develop a mobile-optimized optical flow model by proposing a novel mobile device-compatible architecture, as well as enhancements to the training pipeline, which optimize the model for reduced weight, low memory utilization, and increased speed while maintaining minimal error. Our approach demonstrates superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art lightweight models on the challenging KITTI and Sintel benchmarks. Furthermore, it attains a significantly accelerated inference speed, thereby yielding real-time operational efficiency on the iPhone 8, while surpassing real-time performance levels on more advanced mobile devices.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the sparsity and unique distribution of observations present a significant challenge, resulting in an ill-posed problem with multiple feasible solutions (i.e., hypotheses). This amplifies uncertainty and ambiguity in full-body motion estimation, especially for the lower-body joints. Therefore, we propose a new method, EnvPoser, that employs a two-stage framework to perform full-body motion estimation using sparse tracking signals and pre-scanned environment from VR devices. EnvPoser models the multi-hypothesis nature of human motion through an uncertainty-aware estimation module in the first stage. In the second stage, we refine these multi-hypothesis estimates by integrating semantic and geometric environmental constraints, ensuring that the final motion estimation aligns realistically with both the environmental context and physical interactions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting significant improvements in human motion estimation within motion-environment interaction scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional methods produce sparse, low-detail maps, while recent dense mapping approaches struggle with high latency. To overcome these challenges, we present MAC-Ego3D, a novel framework for real-time collaborative photorealistic 3D reconstruction via Multi-Agent Gaussian Consensus. MAC-Ego3D enables agents to independently construct, align, and iteratively refine local maps using a unified Gaussian splat representation. Through Intra-Agent Gaussian Consensus, it enforces spatial coherence among neighboring Gaussian splats within an agent. For global alignment, parallelized Inter-Agent Gaussian Consensus, which asynchronously aligns and optimizes local maps by regularizing multi-agent Gaussian splats, seamlessly integrates them into a high-fidelity 3D model. Leveraging Gaussian primitives, MAC-Ego3D supports efficient RGB-D rendering, enabling rapid inter-agent Gaussian association and alignment. MAC-Ego3D bridges local precision and global coherence, delivering higher efficiency, largely reducing localization error, and improving mapping fidelity. It establishes a new SOTA on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, achieving a 15x increase in inference speed, order-of-magnitude reductions in ego-motion estimation error for partial cases, and RGB PSNR gains of 4 to 10 dB.

While previous text-to-ODV generation methods achieve impressive results, they struggle with content inaccuracies and inconsistencies due to reliance solely on textual inputs. Although recent motion control techniques provide fine-grained control for video generation, directly applying these methods to ODVs often results in spatial distortion and unsatisfactory performance, especially with complex spherical motions. To tackle these challenges, we propose OmniDrag, the first approach enabling both scene- and object-level motion control for accurate, high-quality omnidirectional image-to-video generation. Building on pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce an omnidirectional control module, which is jointly fine-tuned with temporal attention layers to effectively handle complex spherical motion. In addition, we develop a novel spherical motion estimator that accurately extracts motion-control signals and allows users to perform drag-style ODV generation by simply drawing handle and target points. We also present a new dataset, named Move360, addressing the scarcity of ODV data with large scene and object motions. Experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of OmniDrag in achieving holistic scene-level and fine-grained object-level control for ODV generation.

SLAM is widely used for estimating camera trajectory and point cloud, but monocular SLAM does so only up to an unknown scale factor. Previous works estimate the scale factor through optimization, but this is unreliable and time-consuming. This paper presents an optimization-free scale calibration framework, Human as Checkerboard (HAC). HAC innovatively leverages the human body predicted by human mesh recovery model as a calibration reference. Specifically, it uses the absolute depth of human-scene contact joints as references to calibrate the corresponding relative scene depth from SLAM. HAC benefits from geometric priors encoded in human mesh recovery models to estimate the SLAM scale and achieves precise global human motion estimation. Simple yet powerful, our method sets a new state-of-the-art performance for global human mesh estimation tasks, reducing motion errors by 50% over prior local-to-global methods while using 100$\times$ less inference time than optimization-based methods.

However, estimating event-based HTR optical flow faces two key challenges: the absence of HTR ground-truth data and the intrinsic sparsity of event data. Most existing approaches rely on the flow accumulation paradigms to indirectly supervise intermediate flows, often resulting in accumulation errors and optimization difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a residual-based paradigm for estimating HTR optical flow with event data. Our approach separates HTR flow estimation into two stages: global linear motion estimation and HTR residual flow refinement. The residual paradigm effectively mitigates the impacts of event sparsity on optimization and is compatible with any LTR algorithm. Next, to address the challenge posed by the absence of HTR ground truth, we incorporate novel learning strategies. Specifically, we initially employ a shared refiner to estimate the residual flows, enabling both LTR supervision and HTR inference. Subsequently, we introduce regional noise to simulate the residual patterns of intermediate flows, facilitating the adaptation from LTR supervision to HTR inference. Additionally, we show that the noise-based strategy supports in-domain self-supervised training. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both LTR and HTR metrics, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures | None |

Recent work has focused on fusing the event measurements with inertial measurements to enable ego-motion estimation in high-speed and HDR environments. However, existing methods predominantly rely on IMU preintegration designed mainly for synchronous sensors and discrete-time frameworks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time preintegration method based on the Temporal Gaussian Process (TGP) called GPO. Concretely, we model the preintegration as a time-indexed motion trajectory and leverage an efficient two-step optimization to initialize the precision preintegration pseudo-measurements. Our method realizes a linear and constant time cost for initialization and query, respectively. To further validate the proposal, we leverage the GPO to design an asynchronous event-inertial odometry and compare with other asynchronous fusion schemes within the same odometry system. Experiments conducted on both public and own-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed GPO offers significant advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, outperforming existing approaches in handling asynchronous sensor fusion.</p></details> | 8pages | None |

The perception of these robots face three major challenges: the relative pose change between the tractor and trailer, the asynchronous vibrations between the tractor and trailer, and the significant camera parallax caused by the large size. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Vertex Motion Video Stabilization and Stitching framework designed for unknown environments. To establish the relationship between stabilization and stitching, the proposed Unified Vertex Motion framework comprises the Stitching Motion Field, which addresses relative positional change, and the Stabilization Motion Field, which tackles asynchronous vibrations. Then, recognizing the heterogeneity of optimization functions required for stabilization and stitching, a weighted cost function approach is proposed to address the problem of camera parallax. Furthermore, this framework has been successfully implemented in real tractor-trailer wheeled robots. The proposed Unified Vertex Motion Video Stabilization and Stitching method has been thoroughly tested in various challenging scenarios, demonstrating its accuracy and practicality in real-world robot tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

These motion-aware models are appealing to generate diverse motion patterns, yet there lacks a reliable motion estimator for training such models on large-scale video set in the wild. Traditional metrics, e.g., SSIM or optical flow, are hard to generalize to arbitrary videos, while, it is very tough for human annotators to label the abstract motion intensity neither. Furthermore, the motion intensity shall reveal both local object motion and global camera movement, which has not been studied before. This paper addresses the challenge with a new motion estimator, capable of measuring the decoupled motion intensities of objects and cameras in video. We leverage the contrastive learning on randomly paired videos and distinguish the video with greater motion intensity. Such a paradigm is friendly for annotation and easy to scale up to achieve stable performance on motion estimation. We then present a new I2V model, named MotionStone, developed with the decoupled motion estimator. Experimental results demonstrate the stability of the proposed motion estimator and the state-of-the-art performance of MotionStone on I2V generation. These advantages warrant the decoupled motion estimator to serve as a general plug-in enhancer for both data processing and video generation training.</p></details> |  | None |

These artifacts appear as blurred images that mimic tissue-like appearances, making segmentation difficult. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework that demonstrates superior performance in both motion correction and robust brain tissue segmentation in the presence of artifacts. The core concept lies in a complementary process: a disentanglement learning network progressively removes artifacts, leading to cleaner images and consequently, more accurate segmentation by a jointly trained motion estimation and segmentation network. This network generates three outputs: a motioncorrected image, a motion deformation map that identifies artifact-affected regions, and a brain tissue segmentation mask. This deformation serves as a guidance mechanism for the disentanglement process, aiding the model in recovering lost information or removing artificial structures introduced by the artifacts. Extensive in-vivo experiments on pediatric motion data demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmenting motion-corrupted MRI scans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2024</p></details> | None |

Addressing this need, our paper introduces EgoCast, a bimodal method for 3D human pose forecasting using egocentric videos and proprioceptive data. We study the task of human pose forecasting in a realistic setting, extending the boundaries of temporal forecasting in dynamic scenes and building on the current framework for current pose estimation in the wild. We introduce a current-frame estimation module that generates pseudo-groundtruth poses for inference, eliminating the need for past groundtruth poses typically required by current methods during forecasting. Our experimental results on the recent Ego-Exo4D and Aria Digital Twin datasets validate EgoCast for real-life motion estimation. On the Ego-Exo4D Body Pose 2024 Challenge, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, laying the groundwork for future research in human pose estimation and forecasting in unscripted activities with egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

Early dynamic mapping methods focused on mitigating the negative influence of short-term dynamic objects on camera motion estimation by masking or tracking specific categories, which often fall short in adapting to long-term scene changes. Recent efforts address object association in long-term dynamic environments using neural networks trained on synthetic datasets, but they still rely on predefined object shapes and categories. Other methods incorporate visual, geometric, or semantic heuristics for the association but often lack robustness. In this work, we introduce BYE, a class-agnostic, per-scene point cloud encoder that removes the need for predefined categories, shape priors, or extensive association datasets. Trained on only a single sequence of exploration data, BYE can efficiently perform object association in dynamically changing scenes. We further propose an ensembling scheme combining the semantic strengths of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the scene-specific expertise of BYE, achieving a 7% improvement and a 95% success rate in object association tasks.

Existing Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods rely predominantly on frame-based approaches, which are prone to aliasing and inaccuracies due to limited temporal resolution and motion blur. In this work, we predict a continuous-time human motion field directly from events by leveraging a recurrent feed-forward neural network to predict human motion in the latent space of possible human motions. Prior state-of-the-art event-based methods rely on computationally intensive optimization across a fixed number of poses at high frame rates, which becomes prohibitively expensive as we increase the temporal resolution. In comparison, we present the first work that replaces traditional discrete-time predictions with a continuous human motion field represented as a time-implicit function, enabling parallel pose queries at arbitrary temporal resolutions. Despite the promises of event cameras, few benchmarks have tested the limit of high-speed human motion estimation. We introduce Beam-splitter Event Agile Human Motion Dataset-a hardware-synchronized high-speed human dataset to fill this gap. On this new data, our method improves joint errors by 23.8% compared to previous event human methods while reducing the computational time by 69%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Local-Global Context Learning for Neural Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00446v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In neural video codecs, current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt multi-scale motion compensation to handle diverse motions. These methods estimate and compress either optical flow or deformable offsets to reduce inter-frame redundancy. However, flow-based methods often suffer from inaccurate motion estimation in complicated scenes. Deformable convolution-based methods are more robust but have a higher bit cost for motion coding. In this paper, we propose a hybrid context generation module, which combines the advantages of the above methods in an optimal way and achieves accurate compensation at a low bit cost. Specifically, considering the characteristics of features at different scales, we adopt flow-guided deformable compensation at largest-scale to produce accurate alignment in detailed regions. For smaller-scale features, we perform flow-based warping to save the bit cost for motion coding. Furthermore, we design a local-global context enhancement module to fully explore the local-global information of previous reconstructed signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Hybrid Local-Global Context learning (HLGC) method can significantly enhance the state-of-the-art methods on standard test datasets.</p></details> | Accepted to DCC 2024 | None |

However, while research has mostly focused on driving the accuracy of models in nominal settings, addressing scenarios with difficult lighting conditions and high-speed motions remains out of reach due to the limitations of the sensor. This work addresses this challenge with the first event camera-based TAP method. It leverages the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range of event cameras for robust high-speed tracking, and the global contexts in TAP methods to handle asynchronous and sparse event measurements. We further extend the TAP framework to handle event feature variations induced by motion - thereby addressing an open challenge in purely event-based tracking - with a novel feature alignment loss which ensures the learning of motion-robust features. Our method is trained with data from a new data generation pipeline and systematically ablated across all design decisions. Our method shows strong cross-dataset generalization and performs 135% better on the average Jaccard metric than the baselines. Moreover, on an established feature tracking benchmark, it achieves a 19% improvement over the previous best event-only method and even surpasses the previous best events-and-frames method by 3.7%.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

However, fully sampling the dynamic k-space data is often infeasible due to time constraints and physiological motion such as respiratory and cardiac motion. This necessitates undersampling, which degrades the quality of reconstructed images. Poor image quality not only hinders visualization but also impairs the estimation of deformation fields, crucial for registering dynamic (moving) images to a static reference image. This registration enables tasks such as motion correction, treatment planning, and quantitative analysis in applications like cardiac imaging and MR-guided radiotherapy. To overcome the challenges posed by undersampling and motion, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework that integrates adaptive dynamic k-space sampling, reconstruction, and registration. Our approach begins with a DL-based adaptive sampling strategy, optimizing dynamic k-space acquisition to capture the most relevant data for each specific case. This is followed by a DL-based reconstruction module that produces images optimized for accurate deformation field estimation from the undersampled moving data. Finally, a registration module estimates the deformation fields aligning the reconstructed dynamic images with a static reference. The proposed framework is independent of specific reconstruction and registration modules allowing for plug-and-play integration of these components. The entire framework is jointly trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised loss functions, enabling end-to-end optimization for improved performance across all components. Through controlled experiments and ablation studies, we validate each component, demonstrating that each choice contributes to robust motion estimation from undersampled dynamic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 19 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

GMFlow overcomes local ambiguities caused by occlusion or missing parts by seeking global explanations. We leverage the object's structural information to extend the motion of visible parts of the rigid body to its invisible regions. Specifically, we capture global contextual information through a linear attention mechanism and guide local motion information to generate global motion estimates. Furthermore, we introduce object shape constraints in the flow iteration process, making flow estimation suitable for pose estimation scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that handles the drawbacks of the two typical above-mentioned architectures, we call it kernel-based motion-free video coding. The advantages of the motion-free approach are twofold: it improves the coding efficiency of the network and significantly reduces computational complexity thanks to eliminating motion estimation, motion compensation, and motion coding which are the most time-consuming engines. In addition, the kernel-based auto-encoder alleviates blur artifacts that usually occur with the conventional symmetric autoencoder. Consequently, it improves the visual quality of the reconstructed frames. Experimental results show the proposed framework outperforms the SOTA deep neural video compression networks on the HEVC-class B dataset and is competitive on the UVG and MCL-JCV datasets.

This provides the required supervisory signal on the motion without the need for any motion annotations. In this manner, we couple the information obtained from different images during training and increase accuracy, especially in crowded scenes and when using low frame-rate sequences.

It integrates both higher and lower-scale motion features, in addition to the information of current and previous frames, to enable accurate motion estimation at the current scale. In addition, we design a cascaded spatial predictive coding module to capture the inter-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We further propose an effective context detach and restore scheme to reduce spatial-temporal redundancy in the motion and latent bit-streams and improve compression performance. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.</p></details> |  | None |

There are many methods for producing such estimations, but most boil down to a synchronous discrete-time fusion problem. However, the asynchronous nature of event cameras and their unique fusion mechanism with inertial sensors remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a monocular event-inertial odometry method called AsynEIO, designed to fuse asynchronous event and inertial data within a unified Gaussian Process (GP) regression framework. Our approach incorporates an event-driven frontend that tracks feature trajectories directly from raw event streams at a high temporal resolution. These tracked feature trajectories, along with various inertial factors, are integrated into the same GP regression framework to enable asynchronous fusion. With deriving analytical residual Jacobians and noise models, our method constructs a factor graph that is iteratively optimized and pruned using a sliding-window optimizer. Comparative assessments highlight the performance of different inertial fusion strategies, suggesting optimal choices for varying conditions. Experimental results on both public datasets and our own event-inertial sequences indicate that AsynEIO outperforms existing methods, especially in high-speed and low-illumination scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE (2024-11-4)</p></details> | None |

| **[RINO: Accurate, Robust Radar-Inertial Odometry with Non-Iterative Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07699v2)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise localization and mapping are critical for achieving autonomous navigation in self-driving vehicles. However, ego-motion estimation still faces significant challenges, particularly when GNSS failures occur or under extreme weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain, and snow). In recent years, scanning radar has emerged as an effective solution due to its strong penetration capabilities. Nevertheless, scanning radar data inherently contains high levels of noise, necessitating hundreds to thousands of iterations of optimization to estimate a reliable transformation from the noisy data. Such iterative solving is time-consuming, unstable, and prone to failure. To address these challenges, we propose an accurate and robust Radar-Inertial Odometry system, RINO, which employs a non-iterative solving approach. Our method decouples rotation and translation estimation and applies an adaptive voting scheme for 2D rotation estimation, enhancing efficiency while ensuring consistent solving time. Additionally, the approach implements a loosely coupled system between the scanning radar and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), leveraging Error-State Kalman Filtering (ESKF). Notably, we successfully estimated the uncertainty of the pose estimation from the scanning radar, incorporating this into the filter's Maximum A Posteriori estimation, a consideration that has been previously overlooked. Validation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that RINO outperforms state-of-the-art methods and baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

In this paper, we present BEV-ODOM, a novel MVO framework leveraging the Bird's Eye View (BEV) Representation to address scale drift. Unlike existing approaches, BEV-ODOM integrates a depth-based perspective-view (PV) to BEV encoder, a correlation feature extraction neck, and a CNN-MLP-based decoder, enabling it to estimate motion across three degrees of freedom without the need for depth supervision or complex optimization techniques. Our framework reduces scale drift in long-term sequences and achieves accurate motion estimation across various datasets, including NCLT, Oxford, and KITTI. The results indicate that BEV-ODOM outperforms current MVO methods, demonstrating reduced scale drift and higher accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[iKalibr: Unified Targetless Spatiotemporal Calibration for Resilient Integrated Inertial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11420v2)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integrated inertial system, typically integrating an IMU and an exteroceptive sensor such as radar, LiDAR, and camera, has been widely accepted and applied in modern robotic applications for ego-motion estimation, motion control, or autonomous exploration. To improve system accuracy, robustness, and further usability, both multiple and various sensors are generally resiliently integrated, which benefits the system performance regarding failure tolerance, perception capability, and environment compatibility. For such systems, accurate and consistent spatiotemporal calibration is required to maintain a unique spatiotemporal framework for multi-sensor fusion. Considering most existing calibration methods (i) are generally oriented to specific integrated inertial systems, (ii) often only focus on spatial determination, (iii) usually require artificial targets, lacking convenience and usability, we propose iKalibr: a unified targetless spatiotemporal calibration framework for resilient integrated inertial systems, which overcomes the above issues, and enables both accurate and consistent calibration. Altogether four commonly employed sensors are supported in iKalibr currently, namely IMU, radar, LiDAR, and camera. The proposed method starts with a rigorous and efficient dynamic initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be accurately recovered. Subsequently, several continuous-time batch optimizations are conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. Sufficient real-world experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility and evaluate the calibration performance of iKalibr. The results demonstrate that iKalibr can achieve accurate resilient spatiotemporal calibration. We open-source our implementations at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/iKalibr) to benefit the research community.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/iKalibr) |

Consequently, temporal redundancy is not fully leveraged, resulting in suboptimal compression efficacy. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel coarse-to-fine scheme to generate anchor meshes for frames with time-varying topology. Initially, we generate a coarse anchor mesh using an octree-based nearest neighbor search. Motion estimation compensates for regions with significant motion changes during this process. However, the quality of the coarse mesh is low due to its suboptimal vertices. To enhance details, the fine anchor mesh is further optimized using the Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) algorithm to calculate more precise anchor points. The inter-frame anchor mesh generated herein retains the connectivity of the reference base mesh, while concurrently preserving superior quality. Experimental results show that our method achieves 7.2% ~ 10.3% BD-rate gain compared to the existing V-DMC test model version 7.</p></details> |  | None |

However, fusing these two modalities typically requires a highly accurate calibration between them. In this paper, we propose MDPCalib which is a novel method for camera-LiDAR calibration that requires neither human supervision nor any specific target objects. Instead, we utilize sensor motion estimates from visual and LiDAR odometry as well as deep learning-based 2D-pixel-to-3D-point correspondences that are obtained without in-domain retraining. We represent camera-LiDAR calibration as an optimization problem and minimize the costs induced by constraints from sensor motion and point correspondences. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields highly accurate extrinsic calibration parameters and is robust to random initialization. Additionally, our approach generalizes to a wide range of sensor setups, which we demonstrate by employing it on various robotic platforms including a self-driving perception car, a quadruped robot, and a UAV. To make our calibration method publicly accessible, we release the code on our project website at http://calibration.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite many attempts over the years, motion correction remains a difficult problem and there is no general method applicable to all situations. We propose a retrospective method for motion estimation and correction to tackle the problem of in-plane rigid-body motion, apt for classical 2D Spin-Echo scans of the brain, which are regularly used in clinical practice. Due to the sequential acquisition of k-space, motion artifacts are well localized. The method leverages the power of deep neural networks to estimate motion parameters in k-space and uses a model-based approach to restore degraded images to avoid ''hallucinations''. Notable advantages are its ability to estimate motion occurring in high spatial frequencies without the need of a motion-free reference. The proposed method operates on the whole k-space dynamic range and is moderately affected by the lower SNR of higher harmonics. As a proof of concept, we provide models trained using supervised learning on 600k motion simulations based on motion-free scans of 43 different subjects. Generalization performance was tested with simulations as well as in-vivo. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations are presented for motion parameter estimations and image reconstruction. Experimental results show that our approach is able to obtain good generalization performance on simulated data and in-vivo acquisitions.

To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

The initial developments, such as regression-based and U-Net-based networks, established the foundation for deep learning in image registration. Subsequent progress has been made in various aspects of deep learning-based registration, including similarity measures, deformation regularizations, network architectures, and uncertainty estimation. These advancements have not only enriched the field of image registration but have also facilitated its application in a wide range of tasks, including atlas construction, multi-atlas segmentation, motion estimation, and 2D-3D registration. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the most recent advancements in deep learning-based image registration. We begin with a concise introduction to the core concepts of deep learning-based image registration. Then, we delve into innovative network architectures, loss functions specific to registration, and methods for estimating registration uncertainty.

As such, the motion estimation network may fail to predict large motion properly. One effective strategy to mitigate this domain shift issue is to downsample video frames for motion estimation. However, finding the optimal downsampling factor involves a time-consuming rate-distortion optimization process. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to determine the downsampling factor. To strike a good rate-distortion-complexity trade-off, our classifiers observe simple state signals, including only the coding and reference frames, to predict the best downsampling factor. We present two variants that adopt binary and multi-class classifiers, respectively. The binary classifier adopts the Focal Loss for training, classifying between motion estimation at high and low resolutions. Our multi-class classifier is trained with novel soft labels incorporating the knowledge of the rate-distortion costs of different downsampling factors. Both variants operate as add-on modules without the need to re-train the B-frame codec. Experimental results confirm that they achieve comparable coding performance to the brute-force search methods while greatly reducing computational complexity.</p></details> |  | None |

Prevailing techniques often rely on pre-trained motion estimators or intensive testing-time optimization, resulting in compromised interpolation accuracy or prolonged inference. This work presents FastPCI that introduces Pyramid Convolution-Transformer architecture for point cloud frame interpolation. Our hybrid Convolution-Transformer improves the local and long-range feature learning, while the pyramid network offers multilevel features and reduces the computation. In addition, FastPCI proposes a unique Dual-Direction Motion-Structure block for more accurate scene flow estimation. Our design is motivated by two facts: (1) accurate scene flow preserves 3D structure, and (2) point cloud at the previous timestep should be reconstructable using reverse motion from future timestep. Extensive experiments show that FastPCI significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art PointINet and NeuralPCI with notable gains (e.g. 26.6% and 18.3% reduction in Chamfer Distance in KITTI), while being more than 10x and 600x faster, respectively.

Conventionally, these motion estimates are derived through image-based registration, a particularly challenging task for complex motion patterns and high dynamic resolution. The accelerated scans in such applications result in imaging artifacts that compromise the motion estimation. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised deep learning-based framework, dubbed the Local-All Pass Attention Network (LAPANet), for non-rigid motion estimation directly from the acquired accelerated Fourier space, i.e. k-space. The proposed approach models non-rigid motion as the cumulative sum of local translational displacements, following the Local All-Pass (LAP) registration technique. LAPANet was evaluated on cardiac motion estimation across various sampling trajectories and acceleration rates. Our results demonstrate superior accuracy compared to prior conventional and deep learning-based registration methods, accommodating as few as 2 lines/frame in a Cartesian trajectory and 3 spokes/frame in a non-Cartesian trajectory. The achieved high temporal resolution (less than 5 ms) for non-rigid motion opens new avenues for motion detection, tracking and correction in dynamic and real-time MRI applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Even though they work well in small spaces, conventional methods for reconstructing 3D human motion frequently require the use of expensive hardware and have high processing costs. This study presents HumanAvatar, an innovative approach that efficiently reconstructs precise human avatars from monocular video sources. At the core of our methodology, we integrate the pre-trained HuMoR, a model celebrated for its proficiency in human motion estimation. This is adeptly fused with the cutting-edge neural radiance field technology, Instant-NGP, and the state-of-the-art articulated model, Fast-SNARF, to enhance the reconstruction fidelity and speed. By combining these two technologies, a system is created that can render quickly and effectively while also providing estimation of human pose parameters that are unmatched in accuracy. We have enhanced our system with an advanced posture-sensitive space reduction technique, which optimally balances rendering quality with computational efficiency. In our detailed experimental analysis using both artificial and real-world monocular videos, we establish the advanced performance of our approach. HumanAvatar consistently equals or surpasses contemporary leading-edge reconstruction techniques in quality. Furthermore, it achieves these complex reconstructions in minutes, a fraction of the time typically required by existing methods. Our models achieve a training speed that is 110X faster than that of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) NeRF-based models. Our technique performs noticeably better than SoTA dynamic human NeRF methods if given an identical runtime limit. HumanAvatar can provide effective visuals after only 30 seconds of training.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the integration of CBCT into clinical workflows faces challenges, primarily linked to long scan duration resulting in patient motion during scanning and leading to image quality degradation in the reconstructed volumes. This paper introduces a novel approach to CBCT motion estimation using a gradient-based optimization algorithm, which leverages generalized derivatives of the backprojection operator for cone-beam CT geometries. Building on that, a fully differentiable target function is formulated which grades the quality of the current motion estimate in reconstruction space. We drastically accelerate motion estimation yielding a 19-fold speed-up compared to existing methods. Additionally, we investigate the architecture of networks used for quality metric regression and propose predicting voxel-wise quality maps, favoring autoencoder-like architectures over contracting ones. This modification improves gradient flow, leading to more accurate motion estimation. The presented method is evaluated through realistic experiments on head anatomy. It achieves a reduction in reprojection error from an initial average of 3mm to 0.61mm after motion compensation and consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches. The analytic Jacobian for the backprojection operation, which is at the core of the proposed method, is made publicly available. In summary, this paper contributes to the advancement of CBCT integration into clinical workflows by proposing a robust motion estimation approach that enhances efficiency and accuracy, addressing critical challenges in time-sensitive scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

Compared to frame-based camera, a novel type of bio-inspired visual sensor, i.e. event camera, has demonstrated advantages in high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low power consumption and low latency. Due to its unique asynchronous and irregular data capturing process, limited work has been proposed to apply neural representation or 3D Gaussian splatting for an event camera. In this work, we present IncEventGS, an incremental 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction algorithm with a single event camera. To recover the 3D scene representation incrementally, we exploit the tracking and mapping paradigm of conventional SLAM pipelines for IncEventGS. Given the incoming event stream, the tracker firstly estimates an initial camera motion based on prior reconstructed 3D-GS scene representation. The mapper then jointly refines both the 3D scene representation and camera motion based on the previously estimated motion trajectory from the tracker. The experimental results demonstrate that IncEventGS delivers superior performance compared to prior NeRF-based methods and other related baselines, even we do not have the ground-truth camera poses. Furthermore, our method can also deliver better performance compared to state-of-the-art event visual odometry methods in terms of camera motion estimation.

At the core of 3D PTV is the dual-frame fluid motion estimation algorithm, which tracks particles across two consecutive frames. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive accuracy in dual-frame fluid motion estimation; however, they heavily depend on large volumes of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a new method that is completely self-supervised and notably outperforms its fully-supervised counterparts while requiring only 1% of the training samples (without labels) used by previous methods. Our method features a novel zero-divergence loss that is specific to the domain of turbulent flow. Inspired by the success of splat operation in high-dimensional filtering and random fields, we propose a splat-based implementation for this loss which is both efficient and effective. The self-supervised nature of our method naturally supports test-time optimization, leading to the development of a tailored Dynamic Velocimetry Enhancer (DVE) module.

Surface motion imposes uncertainty on both system parameters and non-homogeneous disturbance in the walking robot dynamics. In this paper, we design an adaptive ankle torque controller to simultaneously address these two uncertainties and propose a step-length planner to minimize the required control torque. Typically, an adaptive controller is used for a continuous system. To apply adaptive control on a hybrid system such as a walking robot, an intermediate command profile is introduced to ensure a continuous error system. Simulations on a planar bipedal robot, along with comparisons against a baseline controller, demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively ensures stable walking and accurate tracking under unknown, time-varying disturbances.</p></details> |  | None |

Beyond traditional hybrid video coding paradigms, Generative Face Video Compression (GFVC) relying on the strong capabilities of deep generative models and the philosophy of early Model-Based Coding (MBC) can facilitate the compact representation and realistic reconstruction of visual face signal, thus achieving ultra-low bitrate face video communication. However, these GFVC algorithms are sometimes faced with unstable reconstruction quality and limited bitrate ranges. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel Progressive Face Video Compression framework, namely PFVC, that utilizes adaptive visual tokens to realize exceptional trade-offs between reconstruction robustness and bandwidth intelligence. In particular, the encoder of the proposed PFVC projects the high-dimensional face signal into adaptive visual tokens in a progressive manner, whilst the decoder can further reconstruct these adaptive visual tokens for motion estimation and signal synthesis with different granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PFVC framework can achieve better coding flexibility and superior rate-distortion performance in comparison with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) codec and the state-of-the-art GFVC algorithms.

This single-model neural video codec operates across a broad range of bitrates, delivering not only superior compression performance to representative methods but also impressive complexity efficiency, enabling real-time processing with a significantly smaller memory footprint on standard GPUs. These remarkable advancements stem from the use of hierarchical predictive coding. Each video frame is uniformly transformed into multiscale representations through hierarchical variational autoencoders. For a specific scale's feature representation of a frame, its corresponding latent residual variables are generated by referencing lower-scale spatial features from the same frame and then conditionally entropy-encoded using a probabilistic model whose parameters are predicted using same-scale temporal reference from previous frames and lower-scale spatial reference of the current frame. This feature-space processing operates from the lowest to the highest scale of each frame, completely eliminating the need for the complexity-intensive motion estimation and compensation techniques that have been standard in video codecs for decades. The hierarchical approach facilitates parallel processing, accelerating both encoding and decoding, and supports transmission-friendly progressive decoding, making it particularly advantageous for networked video applications in the presence of packet loss.

| **[Correspondences of the Third Kind: Camera Pose Estimation from Object Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04527v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision has long relied on two kinds of correspondences: pixel correspondences in images and 3D correspondences on object surfaces. Is there another kind, and if there is, what can they do for us? In this paper, we introduce correspondences of the third kind we call reflection correspondences and show that they can help estimate camera pose by just looking at objects without relying on the background. Reflection correspondences are point correspondences in the reflected world, i.e., the scene reflected by the object surface. The object geometry and reflectance alters the scene geometrically and radiometrically, respectively, causing incorrect pixel correspondences. Geometry recovered from each image is also hampered by distortions, namely generalized bas-relief ambiguity, leading to erroneous 3D correspondences. We show that reflection correspondences can resolve the ambiguities arising from these distortions. We introduce a neural correspondence estimator and a RANSAC algorithm that fully leverages all three kinds of correspondences for robust and accurate joint camera pose and object shape estimation just from the object appearance. The method expands the horizon of numerous downstream tasks, including camera pose estimation for appearance modeling (e.g., NeRF) and motion estimation of reflective objects (e.g., cars on the road), to name a few, as it relieves the requirement of overlapping background.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |

| **[Platypose: Calibrated Zero-Shot Multi-Hypothesis 3D Human Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06164v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single camera 3D pose estimation is an ill-defined problem due to inherent ambiguities from depth, occlusion or keypoint noise. Multi-hypothesis pose estimation accounts for this uncertainty by providing multiple 3D poses consistent with the 2D measurements. Current research has predominantly concentrated on generating multiple hypotheses for single frame static pose estimation or single hypothesis motion estimation. In this study we focus on the new task of multi-hypothesis motion estimation. Multi-hypothesis motion estimation is not simply multi-hypothesis pose estimation applied to multiple frames, which would ignore temporal correlation across frames. Instead, it requires distributions which are capable of generating temporally consistent samples, which is significantly more challenging than multi-hypothesis pose estimation or single-hypothesis motion estimation. To this end, we introduce Platypose, a framework that uses a diffusion model pretrained on 3D human motion sequences for zero-shot 3D pose sequence estimation. Platypose outperforms baseline methods on multiple hypotheses for motion estimation. Additionally, Platypose also achieves state-of-the-art calibration and competitive joint error when tested on static poses from Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW. Finally, because it is zero-shot, our method generalizes flexibly to different settings such as multi-camera inference.</p></details> |  | None |

This leads to severe motion artifacts in the reconstructed images and volumes. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based test-time-training method for accurate motion estimation. The key idea is that a neural network trained for motion-free reconstruction has a small loss if there is no motion, thus optimizing over motion parameters passed through the reconstruction network enables accurate estimation of motion. The estimated motion parameters enable to correct for the motion and to reconstruct accurate motion-corrected images. Our method uses 2D reconstruction networks to estimate rigid motion in 3D, and constitutes the first deep learning based method for 3D rigid motion estimation towards 3D-motion-corrected MRI. We show that our method can provably reconstruct motion parameters for a simple signal and neural network model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for both retrospectively simulated motion and prospectively collected real motion-corrupted data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object Segmentation-Assisted Inter Prediction for Versatile Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11694v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern video coding standards, block-based inter prediction is widely adopted, which brings high compression efficiency. However, in natural videos, there are usually multiple moving objects of arbitrary shapes, resulting in complex motion fields that are difficult to represent compactly. This problem has been tackled by more flexible block partitioning methods in the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard, but the more flexible partitions require more overhead bits to signal and still cannot be made arbitrarily shaped. To address this limitation, we propose an object segmentation-assisted inter prediction method (SAIP), where objects in the reference frames are segmented by some advanced technologies. With a proper indication, the object segmentation mask is translated from the reference frame to the current frame as the arbitrary-shaped partition of different regions without any extra signal. Using the segmentation mask, motion compensation is separately performed for different regions, achieving higher prediction accuracy. The segmentation mask is further used to code the motion vectors of different regions more efficiently. Moreover, the segmentation mask is considered in the joint rate-distortion optimization for motion estimation and partition estimation to derive the motion vector of different regions and partition more accurately. The proposed method is implemented into the VVC reference software, VTM version 12.0. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to 1.98%, 1.14%, 0.79%, and on average 0.82%, 0.49%, 0.37% BD-rate reduction for common test sequences, under the Low-delay P, Low-delay B, and Random Access configurations, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 13 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting (TBC)</p></details> | None |

However, extending NeRFs to model dynamic objects or object articulations remains a challenging problem. Previous works have tackled this issue by focusing on part-level reconstruction and motion estimation for objects, but they often rely on heuristics regarding the number of moving parts or object categories, which can limit their practical use. In this work, we introduce LEIA, a novel approach for representing dynamic 3D objects. Our method involves observing the object at distinct time steps or "states" and conditioning a hypernetwork on the current state, using this to parameterize our NeRF. This approach allows us to learn a view-invariant latent representation for each state. We further demonstrate that by interpolating between these states, we can generate novel articulation configurations in 3D space that were previously unseen. Our experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method in articulating objects in a manner that is independent of the viewing angle and joint configuration. Notably, our approach outperforms previous methods that rely on motion information for articulation registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[SiamMo: Siamese Motion-Centric 3D Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01688v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current 3D single object tracking methods primarily rely on the Siamese matching-based paradigm, which struggles with textureless and incomplete LiDAR point clouds. Conversely, the motion-centric paradigm avoids appearance matching, thus overcoming these issues. However, its complex multi-stage pipeline and the limited temporal modeling capability of a single-stream architecture constrain its potential. In this paper, we introduce SiamMo, a novel and simple Siamese motion-centric tracking approach. Unlike the traditional single-stream architecture, we employ Siamese feature extraction for motion-centric tracking. This decouples feature extraction from temporal fusion, significantly enhancing tracking performance. Additionally, we design a Spatio-Temporal Feature Aggregation module to integrate Siamese features at multiple scales, capturing motion information effectively. We also introduce a Box-aware Feature Encoding module to encode object size priors into motion estimation. SiamMo is a purely motion-centric tracker that eliminates the need for additional processes like segmentation and box refinement. Without whistles and bells, SiamMo not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in challenging scenarios. SiamMo sets a new record on the KITTI tracking benchmark with 90.1\% precision while maintaining a high inference speed of 108 FPS. The code will be released at https://github.com/HDU-VRLab/SiamMo.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/HDU-VRLab/SiamMo) |

Despite its importance, LiDAR detection performance is limited by inherent constraints of point cloud data, particularly under conditions of extended distances and occlusions. Recently, temporal aggregation has been proven to significantly enhance detection accuracy by fusing multi-frame viewpoint information and enriching the spatial representation of objects. In this work, we introduce a novel LiDAR 3D object detection framework, namely LiSTM, to facilitate spatial-temporal feature learning with cross-frame motion forecasting information. We aim to improve the spatial-temporal interpretation capabilities of the LiDAR detector by incorporating a dynamic prior, generated from a non-learnable motion estimation model. Specifically, Motion-Guided Feature Aggregation (MGFA) is proposed to utilize the object trajectory from previous and future motion states to model spatial-temporal correlations into gaussian heatmap over a driving sequence. This motion-based heatmap then guides the temporal feature fusion, enriching the proposed object features. Moreover, we design a Dual Correlation Weighting Module (DCWM) that effectively facilitates the interaction between past and prospective frames through scene- and channel-wise feature abstraction. In the end, a cascade cross-attention-based decoder is employed to refine the 3D prediction. We have conducted experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets to demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior 3D detection performance with effective spatial-temporal feature learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Our system uses 6 inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a commodity head-mounted RGB camera. EgoHDM is the first human mocap system that offers dense scene mapping in near real-time. Further, it is fast and robust to initialize and fully closes the loop between physically plausible map-aware global human motion estimation and mocap-aware 3D scene reconstruction. Our key idea is integrating camera localization and mapping information with inertial human motion capture bidirectionally in our system. To achieve this, we design a tightly coupled mocap-aware dense bundle adjustment and physics-based body pose correction module leveraging a local body-centric elevation map. The latter introduces a novel terrain-aware contact PD controller, which enables characters to physically contact the given local elevation map thereby reducing human floating or penetration. We demonstrate the performance of our system on established synthetic and real-world benchmarks. The results show that our method reduces human localization, camera pose, and mapping accuracy error by 41%, 71%, 46%, respectively, compared to the state of the art. Our qualitative evaluations on newly captured data further demonstrate that EgoHDM can cover challenging scenarios in non-flat terrain including stepping over stairs and outdoor scenes in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://handiyin.github.io/EgoHDM/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://handiyin.github.io/EgoHDM) |

In this paper, we present MoManifold, a novel human motion prior, which models plausible human motion in continuous high-dimensional motion space. Different from existing mathematical or VAE-based methods, our representation is designed based on the neural distance field, which makes human dynamics explicitly quantified to a score and thus can measure human motion plausibility. Specifically, we propose novel decoupled joint acceleration manifolds to model human dynamics from existing limited motion data. Moreover, we introduce a novel optimization method using the manifold distance as guidance, which facilitates a variety of motion-related tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoManifold outperforms existing SOTAs as a prior in several downstream tasks such as denoising real-world human mocap data, recovering human motion from partial 3D observations, mitigating jitters for SMPL-based pose estimators, and refining the results of motion in-betweening.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2024.

Building on recent advancements, such as OpenAI's Sora, we explore the latent diffusion model (LDM) architecture and introduce a video variational autoencoder (VidVAE). VidVAE compresses video data both spatially and temporally, significantly reducing the length of visual tokens and the computational demands associated with generating long-sequence videos. To further address the computational costs, we propose a divide-and-merge strategy that maintains temporal consistency across video segments. Our Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model incorporates spatial and temporal self-attention layers, enabling robust generalization across different timeframes and aspect ratios. We have devised a data processing pipeline from the very beginning and collected over 13M high-quality video-text pairs. The pipeline includes multiple steps such as clipping, text detection, motion estimation, aesthetics scoring, and dense captioning based on our in-house video-LLM model. Training the VidVAE and DiT models required approximately 40 and 642 H100 days, respectively. Our model supports over 14-second 720p video generation in an end-to-end way and demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art T2V models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV24 AI4VA</p></details> | None |

To mitigate the ambiguity, existing methods leverage learned human motion priors, which however often result in oversmoothed motions with misaligned 2D projections. To tackle this problem, we propose COIN, a control-inpainting motion diffusion prior that enables fine-grained control to disentangle human and camera motions. Although pre-trained motion diffusion models encode rich motion priors, we find it non-trivial to leverage such knowledge to guide global motion estimation from RGB videos. COIN introduces a novel control-inpainting score distillation sampling method to ensure well-aligned, consistent, and high-quality motion from the diffusion prior within a joint optimization framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new human-scene relation loss to alleviate the scale ambiguity by enforcing consistency among the humans, camera, and scene. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COIN, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of global human motion estimation and camera motion estimation. As an illustrative example, COIN outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 33% in world joint position error (W-MPJPE) on the RICH dataset.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |

In such conditions, their performance might be compromised due to the inherent complexity of processing data captured under challenging motion. Integration of mechanical stabilizers to compensate for the camera rotation is not always possible due to the robot payload constraints. This paper presents a processing-based stabilization approach to compensate the camera's rotational motion both on events and on frames (i.e., images). Assuming that the camera's attitude is available, we evaluate the benefits of stabilization in two perception applications: feature tracking and estimating the translation component of the camera's ego-motion. The validation is performed using synthetic data and sequences from well-known event-based vision datasets. The experiments unveil that stabilization can improve feature tracking and camera ego-motion estimation accuracy in 27.37% and 34.82%, respectively. Concurrently, stabilization can reduce the processing time of computing the camera's linear velocity by at least 25%.

Although deep network-based video restorers achieve impressive progress, most of the existing methods lack a structured design to optimally leverage the priors within compression codecs. Since the quality degradation of the video is primarily induced by the compression algorithm, a new paradigm is urgently needed for a more ``conscious'' process of quality enhancement. As a result, we propose the Compression-Realized Deep Structural Network (CRDS), introducing three inductive biases aligned with the three primary processes in the classic compression codec, merging the strengths of classical encoder architecture with deep network capabilities. Inspired by the residual extraction and domain transformation process in the codec, a pre-trained Latent Degradation Residual Auto-Encoder is proposed to transform video frames into a latent feature space, and the mutual neighborhood attention mechanism is integrated for precise motion estimation and residual extraction. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the quantization noise distribution of the codec, CRDS proposes a novel Progressive Denoising framework with intermediate supervision that decomposes the quality enhancement into a series of simpler denoising sub-tasks. Experimental results on datasets like LDV 2.0 and MFQE 2.0 indicate our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods are not specifically designed for healthcare purposes and face challenges in real-world applications. Human pose estimation methods often lack the accuracy needed for detecting fine-grained, subtle body movements, while optical flow-based methods struggle with poor lighting conditions and unseen real-world data. These issues result in human body motion estimation errors, particularly during critical medical situations where the body is motionless, such as during unconsciousness. To address these challenges and improve the accuracy of human body motion estimation for healthcare purposes, we propose the OPPH operator designed to enhance current vision-based motion estimation methods. This operator, which considers human body movement and noise properties, functions as a multi-stage filter. Results tested on two real-world and one synthetic human motion dataset demonstrate that the operator effectively removes real-world noise, significantly enhances the detection of motionless states, maintains the accuracy of estimating active body movements, and maintains long-term body movement trends. This method could be beneficial for analyzing both critical medical events and chronic medical conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a novel perspective for addressing the MCMR problem and a more integrated and efficient solution to the MCMR field. Contrary to state-of-the-art (SOTA) MCMR methods which break the original problem into two sub-optimization problems, i.e. motion estimation and reconstruction, we formulate this problem as a single entity with one single optimization. Our approach is unique in that the motion estimation is directly driven by the ultimate goal, reconstruction, but not by the canonical motion-warping loss (similarity measurement between motion-warped images and target images). We align the objectives of motion estimation and reconstruction, eliminating the drawbacks of artifacts-affected motion estimation and therefore error-propagated reconstruction. Further, we can deliver high-quality reconstruction and realistic motion without applying any regularization/smoothness loss terms, circumventing the non-trivial weighting factor tuning. We evaluate our method on two datasets: 1) an in-house acquired 2D CINE dataset for the retrospective study and 2) the public OCMR cardiac dataset for the prospective study. The conducted experiments indicate that the proposed MCMR framework can deliver artifact-free motion estimation and high-quality MR images even for imaging accelerations up to 20x, outperforming SOTA non-MCMR and MCMR methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation across all experiments.

For the VFI task, the motion estimation between neighboring frames plays a crucial role in avoiding motion ambiguity. However, existing VFI methods always struggle to accurately predict the motion information between consecutive frames, and this imprecise estimation leads to blurred and visually incoherent interpolated frames. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion framework, motion-aware latent diffusion models (MADiff), which is specifically designed for the VFI task. By incorporating motion priors between the conditional neighboring frames with the target interpolated frame predicted throughout the diffusion sampling procedure, MADiff progressively refines the intermediate outcomes, culminating in generating both visually smooth and realistic results. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance significantly outperforming existing approaches, especially under challenging scenarios involving dynamic textures with complex motion.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures | None |

For sustainable space utilization, the continuous removal of space debris is the most severe problem for humanity. To maximize the reliability of the debris capture mission in orbit, accurate motion estimation of the target is essential. Space debris has lost its attitude and orbit control capabilities, and its shape is unknown due to the break. This paper proposes the Structure from Motion-based algorithm to perform unknown shaped space debris motion estimation with limited resources, where only 2D images are required as input. The method then outputs the reconstructed shape of the unknown object and the relative pose trajectory between the target and the camera simultaneously, which are exploited to estimate the target's motion.

However, most current analysis methods for arterial 4D flow MRI use static artery walls because of the difficulty in obtaining a full cycle segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a neural fields-based method that directly estimates continuous periodic wall deformations throughout the cardiac cycle. For a 3D + time imaging dataset, we optimize an implicit neural representation (INR) that represents a time-dependent velocity vector field (VVF). An ODE solver is used to integrate the VVF into a deformation vector field (DVF), that can deform images, segmentation masks, or meshes over time, thereby visualizing and quantifying local wall motion patterns. To properly reflect the periodic nature of 3D + time cardiovascular data, we impose periodicity in two ways. First, by periodically encoding the time input to the INR, and hence VVF. Second, by regularizing the DVF. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on synthetic data with different periodic patterns, ECG-gated CT, and 4D flow MRI data. The obtained method could be used to improve 4D flow MRI analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, STACOM 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Uniformly Accelerated Motion Model for Inter Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11541v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inter prediction is a key technology to reduce the temporal redundancy in video coding. In natural videos, there are usually multiple moving objects with variable velocity, resulting in complex motion fields that are difficult to represent compactly. In Versatile Video Coding (VVC), existing inter prediction methods usually assume uniform speed motion between consecutive frames and use the linear models for motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC), which may not well handle the complex motion fields in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce a uniformly accelerated motion model (UAMM) to exploit motion-related elements (velocity, acceleration) of moving objects between the video frames, and further combine them to assist the inter prediction methods to handle the variable motion in the temporal domain. Specifically, first, the theory of UAMM is mentioned. Second, based on that, we propose the UAMM-based parameter derivation and extrapolation schemes in the coding process. Third, we integrate the UAMM into existing inter prediction modes (Merge, MMVD, CIIP) to achieve higher prediction accuracy. The proposed method is implemented into the VVC reference software, VTM version 12.0. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to 0.38% and on average 0.13% BD-rate reduction compared to the VTM anchor, under the Low-delay P configuration, with a slight increase of time complexity on the encoding/decoding side.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures | None |

To this end, a two-layered learning-based human intention recognition mechanism is proposed, utilizing only the kinematic and kinetic data from the robot and two force sensors. A ``subtask detector" recognizes the human intent by estimating which phase of the task is being performed, e.g., \textit{Idle}, \textit{Tool-Attachment}, \textit{Driving}, and \textit{Contact}. Simultaneously, a ``motion estimator" continuously quantifies intent more precisely during the \textit{Driving} to predict when \textit{Contact} will begin. The controller is adapted online according to the subtask while allowing early adaptation before the \textit{Contact} to maximize precision and safety and prevent potential instabilities. Three sets of pHRI experiments were performed with multiple subjects under various conditions. Spring compression experiments were performed in virtual environments to train the data-driven models and validate the proposed adaptive system, and drilling experiments were performed in the physical world to test the proposed methods' efficacy in real-life scenarios. Experimental results show subtask classification accuracy of 84\% and motion estimation R\textsuperscript{2} score of 0.96. Furthermore, 57\% lower human effort was achieved during \textit{Driving} as well as 53\% lower oscillation amplitude at \textit{Contact} as a result of the proposed system.</p></details> |  | None |
