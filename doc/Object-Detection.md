| **[Uncertainty Aware Human-machine Collaboration in Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08373v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), the task of identifying objects concealed within their environments, has seen rapid growth due to its wide range of practical applications. A key step toward developing trustworthy COD systems is the estimation and effective utilization of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a human-machine collaboration framework for classifying the presence of camouflaged objects, leveraging the complementary strengths of computer vision (CV) models and noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our approach introduces a multiview backbone to estimate uncertainty in CV model predictions, utilizes this uncertainty during training to improve efficiency, and defers low-confidence cases to human evaluation via RSVP-based BCIs during testing for more reliable decision-making. We evaluated the framework in the CAMO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 4.56\% in balanced accuracy (BA) and 3.66\% in the F1 score compared to existing methods. For the best-performing participants, the improvements reached 7.6\% in BA and 6.66\% in the F1 score. Analysis of the training process revealed a strong correlation between our confidence measures and precision, while an ablation study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed training policy and the human-machine collaboration strategy. In general, this work reduces human cognitive load, improves system reliability, and provides a strong foundation for advancements in real-world COD applications and human-computer interaction.

However, existing datasets face challenges such as limited modalities, high construction costs, and imprecise annotations. To this end, we propose a synthetic multi-modal UAV-based multi-task dataset, UEMM-Air. Specifically, we simulate various UAV flight scenarios and object types using the Unreal Engine (UE). Then we design the UAV's flight logic to automatically collect data from different scenarios, perspectives, and altitudes. Furthermore, we propose a novel heuristic automatic annotation algorithm to generate accurate object detection labels. Finally, we utilize labels to generate text descriptions of images to make our UEMM-Air support more cross-modality tasks. In total, our UEMM-Air consists of 120k pairs of images with 6 modalities and precise annotations. Moreover, we conduct numerous experiments and establish new benchmark results on our dataset. We also found that models pre-trained on UEMM-Air exhibit better performance on downstream tasks compared to other similar datasets. The dataset is publicly available (https://github.com/1e12Leon/UEMM-Air) to support the research of multi-modal tasks on UAVs.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/1e12Leon/UEMM-Air) |
| **[Plantation Monitoring Using Drone Images: A Dataset and Performance Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08233v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic monitoring of tree plantations plays a crucial role in agriculture. Flawless monitoring of tree health helps farmers make informed decisions regarding their management by taking appropriate action. Use of drone images for automatic plantation monitoring can enhance the accuracy of the monitoring process, while still being affordable to small farmers in developing countries such as India. Small, low cost drones equipped with an RGB camera can capture high-resolution images of agricultural fields, allowing for detailed analysis of the well-being of the plantations. Existing methods of automated plantation monitoring are mostly based on satellite images, which are difficult to get for the farmers. We propose an automated system for plantation health monitoring using drone images, which are becoming easier to get for the farmers. We propose a dataset of images of trees with three categories: ``Good health", ``Stunted", and ``Dead". We annotate the dataset using CVAT annotation tool, for use in research purposes. We experiment with different well-known CNN models to observe their performance on the proposed dataset. The initial low accuracy levels show the complexity of the proposed dataset. Further, our study revealed that, depth-wise convolution operation embedded in a deep CNN model, can enhance the performance of the model on drone dataset. Further, we apply state-of-the-art object detection models to identify individual trees to better monitor them automatically.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Take What You Need: Flexible Multi-Task Semantic Communications with Channel Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08221v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for efficient semantic communication systems capable of managing diverse tasks and adapting to fluctuating channel conditions has driven the development of robust, resource-efficient frameworks. This article introduces a novel channel-adaptive and multi-task-aware semantic communication framework based on a masked auto-encoder architecture. Our framework optimizes the transmission of meaningful information by incorporating a multi-task-aware scoring mechanism that identifies and prioritizes semantically significant data across multiple concurrent tasks. A channel-aware extractor is employed to dynamically select relevant information in response to real-time channel conditions. By jointly optimizing semantic relevance and transmission efficiency, the framework ensures minimal performance degradation under resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework compared to conventional methods in tasks such as image reconstruction and object detection. These results underscore the framework's adaptability to heterogeneous channel environments and its scalability for multi-task applications, positioning it as a promising solution for next-generation semantic communication networks.</p></details> |  | None |

Although Vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing and image understanding, their applications remain limited in professional domains due to insufficient domain expertise. This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompasses diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains. Through experiments on 16 mainstream VLMs, the effectiveness of the dataset has been fully verified.

| **[A Novel Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for Real-Time Object Detection using 4D Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06114v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D object detection is crucial for safe autonomous navigation, requiring reliable performance across diverse weather conditions. While LiDAR performance deteriorates in challenging weather, Radar systems maintain their reliability. Traditional Radars have limitations due to their lack of elevation data, but the recent 4D Radars overcome this by measuring elevation alongside range, azimuth, and Doppler velocity, making them invaluable for autonomous vehicles. The primary challenge in utilizing 4D Radars is the sparsity of their point clouds. Previous works address this by developing architectures that better capture semantics and context in sparse point cloud, largely drawing from LiDAR-based approaches. However, these methods often overlook a unique advantage of 4D Radars: the dense Radar tensor, which encapsulates power measurements across three spatial dimensions and the Doppler dimension. Our paper leverages this tensor to tackle the sparsity issue. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables a student model to densify its sparse input in the latent space by emulating an ensemble of teacher models. Our experiments demonstrate a 25% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art RTNH model on the K-Radar dataset. Notably, this improvement is achieved while still maintaining a real-time inference speed.</p></details> | Arxiv preprint | None |
| **[Knowledge Swapping via Learning and Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08075v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce \textbf{Knowledge Swapping}, a novel task designed to selectively regulate knowledge of a pretrained model by enabling the forgetting of user\-specified information, retaining essential knowledge, and acquiring new knowledge simultaneously. By delving into the analysis of knock-on feature hierarchy, we find that incremental learning typically progresses from low\-level representations to higher\-level semantics, whereas forgetting tends to occur in the opposite direction\-starting from high-level semantics and moving down to low-level features. Building upon this, we propose to benchmark the knowledge swapping task with the strategy of \textit{Learning Before Forgetting}. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping}{https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping}.</p></details> | 10 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping) |

Existing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems relying on gestures or verbal commands are impractical for the elderly due to difficulties with complex syntax or sign language. To address the challenge, this paper introduces a multi-modal interaction framework that combines voice and deictic posture information to create a more natural HRI system. The visual cues are first processed by the object detection model to gain a global understanding of the environment, and then bounding boxes are estimated based on depth information. By using a large language model (LLM) with voice-to-text commands and temporally aligned selected bounding boxes, robot action sequences can be generated, while key control syntax constraints are applied to avoid potential LLM hallucination issues. The system is evaluated on real-world tasks with varying levels of complexity using a Universal Robots UR3e manipulator. Our method demonstrates significantly better performance in HRI in terms of accuracy and robustness. To benefit the research community and the general public, we will make our code and design open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine on 11 Feb 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[From Fog to Failure: How Dehazing Can Harm Clear Image Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02027v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the challenges of integrating human visual cue-based dehazing into object detection, given the selective nature of human perception. While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then enhanced via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LP-DETR: Layer-wise Progressive Relations for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05147v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents LP-DETR (Layer-wise Progressive DETR), a novel approach that enhances DETR-based object detection through multi-scale relation modeling. Our method introduces learnable spatial relationships between object queries through a relation-aware self-attention mechanism, which adaptively learns to balance different scales of relations (local, medium and global) across decoder layers. This progressive design enables the model to effectively capture evolving spatial dependencies throughout the detection pipeline. Extensive experiments on COCO 2017 dataset demonstrate that our method improves both convergence speed and detection accuracy compared to standard self-attention module. The proposed method achieves competitive results, reaching 52.3\% AP with 12 epochs and 52.5\% AP with 24 epochs using ResNet-50 backbone, and further improving to 58.0\% AP with Swin-L backbone. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an interesting pattern: the model naturally learns to prioritize local spatial relations in early decoder layers while gradually shifting attention to broader contexts in deeper layers, providing valuable insights for future research in object detection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Finding Dino: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Zero-Shot Detection of Out-of-Distribution Objects Using Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07664v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting and localising unknown or out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in any scene can be a challenging task in vision, particularly in safety-critical cases involving autonomous systems like automated vehicles or trains. Supervised anomaly segmentation or open-world object detection models depend on training on exhaustively annotated datasets for every domain and still struggle in distinguishing between background and OOD objects. In this work, we present a plug-and-play framework - PRototype-based OOD detection Without Labels (PROWL). It is an inference-based method that does not require training on the domain dataset and relies on extracting relevant features from self-supervised pre-trained models. PROWL can be easily adapted to detect in-domain objects in any operational design domain (ODD) in a zero-shot manner by specifying a list of known classes from this domain. PROWL, as a first zero-shot unsupervised method, achieves state-of-the-art results on the RoadAnomaly and RoadObstacle datasets provided in road driving benchmarks - SegmentMeIfYouCan (SMIYC) and Fishyscapes, as well as comparable performance against existing supervised methods trained without auxiliary OOD data. We also demonstrate its generalisability to other domains such as rail and maritime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Visual-based spatial audio generation system for multi-speaker environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07538v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimedia applications such as films and video games, spatial audio techniques are widely employed to enhance user experiences by simulating 3D sound: transforming mono audio into binaural formats. However, this process is often complex and labor-intensive for sound designers, requiring precise synchronization of audio with the spatial positions of visual components. To address these challenges, we propose a visual-based spatial audio generation system - an automated system that integrates face detection YOLOv8 for object detection, monocular depth estimation, and spatial audio techniques. Notably, the system operates without requiring additional binaural dataset training. The proposed system is evaluated against existing Spatial Audio generation system using objective metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves spatial consistency between audio and video, enhances speech quality, and performs robustly in multi-speaker scenarios. By streamlining the audio-visual alignment process, the proposed system enables sound engineers to achieve high-quality results efficiently, making it a valuable tool for professionals in multimedia production.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Robotics-Inspired Scanpath Model Reveals the Importance of Uncertainty and Semantic Object Cues for Gaze Guidance in Dynamic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01322v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objects we perceive guide our eye movements when observing real-world dynamic scenes. Yet, gaze shifts and selective attention are critical for perceiving details and refining object boundaries. Object segmentation and gaze behavior are, however, typically treated as two independent processes. Here, we present a computational model that simulates these processes in an interconnected manner and allows for hypothesis-driven investigations of distinct attentional mechanisms. Drawing on an information processing pattern from robotics, we use a Bayesian filter to recursively segment the scene, which also provides an uncertainty estimate for the object boundaries that we use to guide active scene exploration. We demonstrate that this model closely resembles observers' free viewing behavior on a dataset of dynamic real-world scenes, measured by scanpath statistics, including foveation duration and saccade amplitude distributions used for parameter fitting and higher-level statistics not used for fitting. These include how object detections, inspections, and returns are balanced and a delay of returning saccades without an explicit implementation of such temporal inhibition of return. Extensive simulations and ablation studies show that uncertainty promotes balanced exploration and that semantic object cues are crucial to forming the perceptual units used in object-based attention. Moreover, we show how our model's modular design allows for extensions, such as incorporating saccadic momentum or pre-saccadic attention, to further align its output with human scanpaths.</p></details> | <details><summary>40+25...</summary><p>40+25 pages, 8+7 figures</p></details> | None |

Several thousand such paintings exist, but a quantitative analysis of them has not been carried out. We created an extensive dataset of 1,939 Holocaust prisoner artworks, and we employed an object detection framework that found 19,377 objects within these artworks. To support the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the art collection and its objects, we have developed an intuitive and interactive dashboard to promote a deeper engagement with these visual testimonies. The dashboard features various visual interfaces, e.g., a word cloud showing the detected objects and a map of artwork origins, and options for filtering. We presented the interface to domain experts, whose feedback highlights the dashboard's intuitiveness and potential for both quantitative and qualitative analysis while also providing relevant suggestions for improvement. Our project demonstrates the benefit of digital methods such as machine learning and visual analytics for Holocaust remembrance and educational purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Prague Visual History and Digital Humanities Conference (PRAVIDCO) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Fast-COS: A Fast One-Stage Object Detector Based on Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07417v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The perception system is a a critical role of an autonomous driving system for ensuring safety. The driving scene perception system fundamentally represents an object detection task that requires achieving a balance between accuracy and processing speed. Many contemporary methods focus on improving detection accuracy but often overlook the importance of real-time detection capabilities when computational resources are limited. Thus, it is vital to investigate efficient object detection strategies for driving scenes. This paper introduces Fast-COS, a novel single-stage object detection framework crafted specifically for driving scene applications. The research initiates with an analysis of the backbone, considering both macro and micro architectural designs, yielding the Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer (RAViT). RAViT utilizes Reparameterized Multi-Scale Depth-Wise Convolution (RepMSDW) and Reparameterized Self-Attention (RepSA) to enhance computational efficiency and feature extraction. In extensive tests across GPU, edge, and mobile platforms, RAViT achieves 81.4% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset, demonstrating significant throughput improvements over comparable backbone models such as ResNet, FastViT, RepViT, and EfficientFormer. Additionally, integrating RepMSDW into a feature pyramid network forms RepFPN, enabling fast and multi-scale feature fusion. Fast-COS enhances object detection in driving scenes, attaining an AP50 score of 57.2% on the BDD100K dataset and 80.0% on the TJU-DHD Traffic dataset. It surpasses leading models in efficiency, delivering up to 75.9% faster GPU inference and 1.38 higher throughput on edge devices compared to FCOS, YOLOF, and RetinaNet. These findings establish Fast-COS as a highly scalable and reliable solution suitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-limited environments like autonomous driving systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review on IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> | None |
| **[Multi-Task-oriented Nighttime Haze Imaging Enhancer for Vision-driven Measurement Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07351v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) plays a critical role in vision-driven measurement systems (VMS), facilitating the detection and segmentation of key visual elements in an image. However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality, and complicating the SOD process. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MToIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MToIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MToIE surpasses existing methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of vision systems across diverse imaging scenarios.

| **[SparseFormer: Detecting Objects in HRW Shots via Sparse Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07216v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen an increase in the use of gigapixel-level image and video capture systems and benchmarks with high-resolution wide (HRW) shots. However, unlike close-up shots in the MS COCO dataset, the higher resolution and wider field of view raise unique challenges, such as extreme sparsity and huge scale changes, causing existing close-up detectors inaccuracy and inefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic sparse vision transformer, dubbed SparseFormer, to bridge the gap of object detection between close-up and HRW shots. The proposed SparseFormer selectively uses attentive tokens to scrutinize the sparsely distributed windows that may contain objects. In this way, it can jointly explore global and local attention by fusing coarse- and fine-grained features to handle huge scale changes. SparseFormer also benefits from a novel Cross-slice non-maximum suppression (C-NMS) algorithm to precisely localize objects from noisy windows and a simple yet effective multi-scale strategy to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments on two HRW benchmarks, PANDA and DOTA-v1.0, demonstrate that the proposed SparseFormer significantly improves detection accuracy (up to 5.8%) and speed (up to 3x) over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ACM MM 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Dense Object Detection Based on De-homogenized Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07194v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense object detection is widely used in automatic driving, video surveillance, and other fields. This paper focuses on the challenging task of dense object detection. Currently, detection methods based on greedy algorithms, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), often produce many repetitive predictions or missed detections in dense scenarios, which is a common problem faced by NMS-based algorithms. Through the end-to-end DETR (DEtection TRansformer), as a type of detector that can incorporate the post-processing de-duplication capability of NMS, etc., into the network, we found that homogeneous queries in the query-based detector lead to a reduction in the de-duplication capability of the network and the learning efficiency of the encoder, resulting in duplicate prediction and missed detection problems. To solve this problem, we propose learnable differentiated encoding to de-homogenize the queries, and at the same time, queries can communicate with each other via differentiated encoding information, replacing the previous self-attention among the queries. In addition, we used joint loss on the output of the encoder that considered both location and confidence prediction to give a higher-quality initialization for queries. Without cumbersome decoder stacking and guaranteeing accuracy, our proposed end-to-end detection framework was more concise and reduced the number of parameters by about 8% compared to deformable DETR. Our method achieved excellent results on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset with 93.6% average precision (AP), 39.2% MR-2, and 84.3% JI. The performance overperformed previous SOTA methods, such as Iter-E2EDet (Progressive End-to-End Object Detection) and MIP (One proposal, Multiple predictions). In addition, our method is more robust in various scenarios with different densities.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Foreign-Object Detection in High-Voltage Transmission Line Based on Improved YOLOv8m](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07175v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safe operation of high-voltage transmission lines ensures the power grid's security. Various foreign objects attached to the transmission lines, such as balloons, kites and nesting birds, can significantly affect the safe and stable operation of high-voltage transmission lines. With the advancement of computer vision technology, periodic automatic inspection of foreign objects is efficient and necessary. Existing detection methods have low accuracy because foreign objects at-tached to the transmission lines are complex, including occlusions, diverse object types, significant scale variations, and complex backgrounds. In response to the practical needs of the Yunnan Branch of China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd., this paper proposes an improved YOLOv8m-based model for detecting foreign objects on transmission lines. Experiments are conducted on a dataset collected from Yunnan Power Grid. The proposed model enhances the original YOLOv8m by in-corporating a Global Attention Module (GAM) into the backbone to focus on occluded foreign objects, replacing the SPPF module with the SPPCSPC module to augment the model's multiscale feature extraction capability, and introducing the Focal-EIoU loss function to address the issue of high- and low-quality sample imbalances. These improvements accelerate model convergence and enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves a 2.7% increase in mAP_0.5, a 4% increase in mAP_0.5:0.95, and a 6% increase in recall.</p></details> | 24 pages, 16 figures | None |

For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

This paper investigates Mamba architecture for visual domain applications and its recent advancements, including Vision Mamba (ViM) and VideoMamba, which introduce bidirectional scanning, selective scanning mechanisms, and spatiotemporal processing to enhance image and video understanding. Architectural innovations like position embeddings, cross-scan modules, and hierarchical designs further optimize the Mamba framework for global and local feature extraction.

| **[Multimodal Search on a Line](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07000v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the diverse set of technologies used in underground object detection and imaging, we introduce a novel multimodal linear search problem whereby a single searcher starts at the origin and must find a target that can only be detected when the searcher moves through its location using the correct of $p$ possible search modes. The target's location, its distance $d$ from the origin, and the correct search mode are all initially unknown to the searcher. We prove tight upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio for this problem. Specifically, we show that when $p$ is odd, the optimal competitive ratio is given by $2p+3+\sqrt{8(p+1)}$, whereas when $p$ is even, the optimal competitive ratio is given by $c$: the unique solution to $(c-1)^4-4p(c+1)^2(c-p-1)=0$ in the interval $\left[2p+1+\sqrt{8p},\infty\right)$. This solution $c$ has the explicit bounds $2p+3+\sqrt{8(p-1)}\leq c\leq 2p+3+\sqrt{8p}$. The optimal algorithms we propose require the searcher to move infinitesimal distances and change directions infinitely many times within finite intervals. To better suit practical applications, we also propose an approximation algorithm with a competitive ratio of $c+\varepsilon$ (where $c$ is the optimal competitive ratio and $\varepsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant). This algorithm involves the searcher moving finite distances and changing directions a finite number of times within any finite interval.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AgilePilot: DRL-Based Drone Agent for Real-Time Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments by Leveraging Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06725v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous drone navigation in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge, especially when dealing with unpredictable scenarios including fast-moving objects with rapidly changing goal positions. While traditional planners and classical optimisation methods have been extensively used to address this dynamic problem, they often face real-time, unpredictable changes that ultimately leads to sub-optimal performance in terms of adaptiveness and real-time decision making. In this work, we propose a novel motion planner, AgilePilot, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that is trained in dynamic conditions, coupled with real-time Computer Vision (CV) for object detections during flight. The training-to-deployment framework bridges the Sim2Real gap, leveraging sophisticated reward structures that promotes both safety and agility depending upon environment conditions. The system can rapidly adapt to changing environments, while achieving a maximum speed of 3.0 m/s in real-world scenarios. In comparison, our approach outperforms classical algorithms such as Artificial Potential Field (APF) based motion planner by 3 times, both in performance and tracking accuracy of dynamic targets by using velocity predictions while exhibiting 90% success rate in 75 conducted experiments. This work highlights the effectiveness of DRL in tackling real-time dynamic navigation challenges, offering intelligent safety and agility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript has been submitted to 2025 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (ICUAS)</p></details> | None |
| **[Direct-CP: Directed Collaborative Perception for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles via Proactive Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08840v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception (CP) leverages visual data from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) to enhance an ego vehicle's field of view (FoV). Despite recent progress, current CP methods expand the ego vehicle's 360-degree perceptual range almost equally, which faces two key challenges. Firstly, in areas with uneven traffic distribution, focusing on directions with little traffic offers limited benefits. Secondly, under limited communication budgets, allocating excessive bandwidth to less critical directions lowers the perception accuracy in more vital areas. To address these issues, we propose Direct-CP, a proactive and direction-aware CP system aiming at improving CP in specific directions. Our key idea is to enable an ego vehicle to proactively signal its interested directions and readjust its attention to enhance local directional CP performance. To achieve this, we first propose an RSU-aided direction masking mechanism that assists an ego vehicle in identifying vital directions. Additionally, we design a direction-aware selective attention module to wisely aggregate pertinent features based on ego vehicle's directional priorities, communication budget, and the positional data of CAVs. Moreover, we introduce a direction-weighted detection loss (DWLoss) to capture the divergence between directional CP outcomes and the ground truth, facilitating effective model training. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 19.8\% higher local perception accuracy in interested directions and 2.5\% higher overall perception accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods in collaborative 3D object detection tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA'25 | None |
| **[EdgeMLBalancer: A Self-Adaptive Approach for Dynamic Model Switching on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06493v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of machine learning on edge devices, such as mobile phones, laptops, IoT devices, etc., has enabled real-time AI applications in resource-constrained environments. Existing solutions for managing computational resources often focus narrowly on accuracy or energy efficiency, failing to adapt dynamically to varying workloads. Furthermore, the existing system lack robust mechanisms to adaptively balance CPU utilization, leading to inefficiencies in resource-constrained scenarios like real-time traffic monitoring. To address these limitations, we propose a self-adaptive approach that optimizes CPU utilization and resource management on edge devices. Our approach, EdgeMLBalancer balances between models through dynamic switching, guided by real-time CPU usage monitoring across processor cores. Tested on real-time traffic data, the approach adapts object detection models based on CPU usage, ensuring efficient resource utilization. The approach leverages epsilon-greedy strategy which promotes fairness and prevents resource starvation, maintaining system robustness. The results of our evaluation demonstrate significant improvements by balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, highlighting the approach's ability to adapt seamlessly to varying workloads. This work lays the groundwork for further advancements in self-adaptation for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Amnesia as a Catalyst for Enhancing Black Box Pixel Attacks in Image Classification and Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07821v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that query-based attacks tend to have relatively higher success rates in adversarial black-box attacks. While research on black-box attacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on pixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image classification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily depend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more suitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, query-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box attack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement Learning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget processes. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging rewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR effectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while adhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed attack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the confidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed state-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the MSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction to state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query. Further experiments on the Argoverse dataset using YOLOv8 confirm that RFPAR effectively removed objects on a larger scale dataset.

Intelligent inspection of power transmission lines has become increasingly important. However, subsequent intelligent inspection relies on accurately detecting various key components. Due to the low detection accuracy of key components in transmission line image inspection, this paper proposed an improved object detection model based on the YOLOv5s (You Only Look Once Version 5 Small) model to improve the detection accuracy of key components of transmission lines. According to the characteristics of the power grid inspection image, we first modify the distance measurement in the k-means clustering to improve the anchor matching of the YOLOv5s model. Then, we add the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) attention mechanism to the backbone network to improve accuracy. Finally, we apply the focal loss function to reduce the impact of class imbalance. Our improved method's mAP (mean average precision) reached 98.1%, the precision reached 97.5%, the recall reached 94.4%, and the detection rate reached 84.8 FPS (frames per second). The experimental results show that our improved model improves detection accuracy and has performance advantages over other models.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Deep Fourier-embedded Network for RGB and Thermal Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18409v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of deep learning has significantly improved salient object detection (SOD) combining both RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images. However, existing deep learning-based RGB-T SOD models suffer from two major limitations. First, Transformer-based models with quadratic complexity are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting their application in high-resolution bi-modal feature fusion. Second, even when these models converge to an optimal solution, there remains a frequency gap between the prediction and ground-truth. To overcome these limitations, we propose a purely Fourier transform-based model, namely Deep Fourier-Embedded Network (DFENet), for accurate RGB-T SOD. To address the computational complexity when dealing with high-resolution images, we leverage the efficiency of fast Fourier transform with linear complexity to design three key components: (1) the Modal-coordinated Perception Attention, which fuses RGB and thermal modalities with enhanced multi-dimensional representation; (2) the Frequency-decomposed Edge-aware Block, which clarifies object edges by deeply decomposing and enhancing frequency components of low-level features; and (3) the Fourier Residual Channel Attention Block, which prioritizes high-frequency information while aligning channel-wise global relationships. To mitigate the frequency gap, we propose Co-focus Frequency Loss, which dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing bi-modal edge information in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on four RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate that DFENet outperforms fifteen existing state-of-the-art RGB-T SOD models. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the value and effectiveness of our newly proposed components.

| **[MOS: Model Synergy for Test-Time Adaptation on LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14878v3)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D object detection is crucial for various applications but often experiences performance degradation in real-world deployments due to domain shifts. While most studies focus on cross-dataset shifts, such as changes in environments and object geometries, practical corruptions from sensor variations and weather conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel online test-time adaptation framework for 3D detectors that effectively tackles these shifts, including a challenging cross-corruption scenario where cross-dataset shifts and corruptions co-occur. By leveraging long-term knowledge from previous test batches, our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and adapts effectively to diverse shifts. Specifically, we propose a Model Synergy (MOS) strategy that dynamically selects historical checkpoints with diverse knowledge and assembles them to best accommodate the current test batch. This assembly is directed by our proposed Synergy Weights (SW), which perform a weighted averaging of the selected checkpoints, minimizing redundancy in the composite model. The SWs are computed by evaluating the similarity of predicted bounding boxes on the test data and the independence of features between checkpoint pairs in the model bank. To maintain an efficient and informative model bank, we discard checkpoints with the lowest average SW scores, replacing them with newly updated models. Our method was rigorously tested against existing test-time adaptation strategies across three datasets and eight types of corruptions, demonstrating superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and conditions. Notably, it achieved a 67.3% improvement in a challenging cross-corruption scenario, offering a more comprehensive benchmark for adaptation.

However, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised learning, which faces significant challenges: the requirement for extensive labeled training data and lack of interpretability in decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we present a training-free framework that integrates open-set object detection with symbolic regression, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient symbolic pattern discovery. The LLMs guide the symbolic reasoning process, establishing logical relationships between detected entities. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains, our framework demonstrates several key advantages: (1) achieving superior detection accuracy through direct reasoning without any training process; (2) providing highly interpretable logical expressions that are readily comprehensible to humans; and (3) requiring minimal annotation effort - approximately 1% of the data needed by traditional training-based methods.To facilitate comprehensive evaluation and future research, we introduce two datasets: a large-scale private dataset containing over 110,000 annotated images covering various anomaly scenarios including construction site safety violations, illegal fishing activities, and industrial hazards, along with a public benchmark dataset of 5,000 samples with detailed anomaly event annotations.

| **[Secure Visual Data Processing via Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06889v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demand for privacy in visual data management grows, safeguarding sensitive information has become a critical challenge. This paper addresses the need for privacy-preserving solutions in large-scale visual data processing by leveraging federated learning. Although there have been developments in this field, previous research has mainly focused on integrating object detection with either anonymization or federated learning. However, these pairs often fail to address complex privacy concerns. On the one hand, object detection with anonymization alone can be vulnerable to reverse techniques. On the other hand, federated learning may not provide sufficient privacy guarantees. Therefore, we propose a new approach that combines object detection, federated learning and anonymization. Combining these three components aims to offer a robust privacy protection strategy by addressing different vulnerabilities in visual data. Our solution is evaluated against traditional centralized models, showing that while there is a slight trade-off in accuracy, the privacy benefits are substantial, making it well-suited for privacy sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we prove the utility of this database by training an original two-stage deep object detection model tailored for the processing of audio data. While allowing the precise localization of bird calls in spectrograms, this model shows competitive accuracy on the 45 main species of the dataset with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger audio collections. These results highlight the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files.

Most existing methods treat the detector monolithically, relying on instance replay or knowledge distillation without analyzing component-specific forgetting. Through dissection of Faster R-CNN, we reveal a key insight: Catastrophic forgetting is predominantly localized to the RoI Head classifier, while regressors retain robustness across incremental stages. This finding challenges conventional assumptions, motivating us to develop a framework termed NSGP-RePRE. Regional Prototype Replay (RePRE) mitigates classifier forgetting via replay of two types of prototypes: coarse prototypes represent class-wise semantic centers of RoI features, while fine-grained prototypes model intra-class variations. Null Space Gradient Projection (NSGP) is further introduced to eliminate prototype-feature misalignment by updating the feature extractor in directions orthogonal to subspace of old inputs via gradient projection, aligning RePRE with incremental learning dynamics. Our simple yet effective design allows NSGP-RePRE to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets under various settings. Our work not only advances IOD methodology but also provide pivotal insights for catastrophic forgetting mitigation in IOD.

However, architectures based on deep neural networks have started to yield diminishing returns, primarily due to their statistical nature and inability to capture causal structure in the training data. Another issue with deep learning is its high energy consumption, which is not that desirable from a sustainability perspective. Therefore, alternative approaches are being considered to address these issues, both of which are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. One approach is causal learning, which takes into account causality among the items in the dataset on which the neural network is trained. It is expected that this will help minimize the spurious correlations that are prevalent in the learned representations of deep neural networks. The other approach is Neurochaos Learning, a recent development, which draws its inspiration from the nonlinear chaotic firing intrinsic to neurons in biological neural networks (brain/central nervous system). Both approaches have shown improved results over just deep learning alone. To that end, in this position paper, we investigate how causal and neurochaos learning approaches can be integrated together to produce better results, especially in domains that contain linked data. We propose an approach for this integration to enhance classification, prediction and reinforcement learning. We also propose a set of research questions that need to be investigated in order to make this integration a reality.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

Nevertheless, a prevalent limitation in existing models is overemphasizing the current input while ignoring the information from the entire dataset. We introduce an innovative Retriever-Dictionary (RD) module to address this issue. This architecture enables YOLO-based models to efficiently retrieve features from a Dictionary that contains the insight of the dataset, which is built by the knowledge from Visual Models (VM), Large Language Models (LLM), or Visual Language Models (VLM). The flexible RD enables the model to incorporate such explicit knowledge that enhances the ability to benefit multiple tasks, specifically, segmentation, detection, and classification, from pixel to image level. The experiments show that using the RD significantly improves model performance, achieving more than a 3\% increase in mean Average Precision for object detection with less than a 1% increase in model parameters. Beyond 1-stage object detection models, the RD module improves the effectiveness of 2-stage models and DETR-based architectures, such as Faster R-CNN and Deformable DETR.

Existing methods for salmon counting using high-resolution imaging sonar hardware are non-invasive and compatible with computer vision processing. Prior work in this area has utilized object detection and tracking based methods for automated salmon counting. However, these techniques remain inaccessible to many sonar deployment sites due to limited compute and connectivity in the field.

We predict upstream and downstream counts within 200-frame time windows directly from echograms using a ResNet-18 model, and propose a set of domain-specific image augmentations and a weakly-supervised training protocol to further improve results.

This limitation stems from VPCC's inability to prioritize regions of different importance within point clouds. To address this issue, we propose DetVPCC, a novel method integrating region-of-interest (RoI) encoding with VPCC for efficient point cloud sequence compression while preserving the 3D object detection accuracy. Specifically, we augment VPCC to support RoI-based compression by assigning spatially non-uniform quality levels. Then, we introduce a lightweight RoI detector to identify crucial regions that potentially contain objects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the detection accuracy.

Despite considerable advancements in bottom-up and multi-object discovery methods that leverage basic visual cues to identify salient objects, consistently achieving a high recall rate remains difficult due to the diversity of object types and their contextual complexity. In this work, we investigate using vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance object detection via a self-supervised prompt learning strategy. Our initial findings indicate that manually crafted text queries often result in undetected objects, primarily because detection confidence diminishes when the query words exhibit semantic overlap. To address this, we propose a Dispersing Prompt Expansion (DiPEx) approach. DiPEx progressively learns to expand a set of distinct, non-overlapping hyperspherical prompts to enhance recall rates, thereby improving performance in downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution OD. Specifically, DiPEx initiates the process by self-training generic parent prompts and selecting the one with the highest semantic uncertainty for further expansion. The resulting child prompts are expected to inherit semantics from their parent prompts while capturing more fine-grained semantics. We apply dispersion losses to ensure high inter-class discrepancy among child prompts while preserving semantic consistency between parent-child prompt pairs. To prevent excessive growth of the prompt sets, we utilize the maximum angular coverage (MAC) of the semantic space as a criterion for early termination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiPEx through extensive class-agnostic OD and OOD-OD experiments on MS-COCO and LVIS, surpassing other prompting methods by up to 20.1\% in AR and achieving a 21.3\% AP improvement over SAM.

However, PAFPN struggles to integrate high-level semantic cues with low-level spatial details, limiting its performance in real-world applications, especially with significant scale variations. In this paper, we propose MHAF-YOLO, a novel detection framework featuring a versatile neck design called the Multi-Branch Auxiliary FPN (MAFPN), which consists of two key modules: the Superficial Assisted Fusion (SAF) and Advanced Assisted Fusion (AAF). The SAF bridges the backbone and the neck by fusing shallow features, effectively transferring crucial low-level spatial information with high fidelity. Meanwhile, the AAF integrates multi-scale feature information at deeper neck layers, delivering richer gradient information to the output layer and further enhancing the model learning capacity. To complement MAFPN, we introduce the Global Heterogeneous Flexible Kernel Selection (GHFKS) mechanism and the Reparameterized Heterogeneous Multi-Scale (RepHMS) module to enhance feature fusion. RepHMS is globally integrated into the network, utilizing GHFKS to select larger convolutional kernels for various feature layers, expanding the vertical receptive field and capturing contextual information across spatial hierarchies. Locally, it optimizes convolution by processing both large and small kernels within the same layer, broadening the lateral receptive field and preserving crucial details for detecting smaller targets.

Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we rethink this challenging task setting with the layout among instances and present Point2RBox-v2. At the core are three principles: 1) Gaussian overlap loss. It learns an upper bound for each instance by treating objects as 2D Gaussian distributions and minimizing their overlap. 2) Voronoi watershed loss. It learns a lower bound for each instance through watershed on Voronoi tessellation. 3) Consistency loss. It learns the size/rotation variation between two output sets with respect to an input image and its augmented view. Supplemented by a few devised techniques, e.g. edge loss and copy-paste, the detector is further enhanced. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox-v2 is the first approach to explore the spatial layout among instances for learning point-supervised OOD.

| **[An Optimized YOLOv5 Based Approach For Real-time Vehicle Detection At Road Intersections Using Fisheye Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04566v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real time vehicle detection is a challenging task for urban traffic surveillance. Increase in urbanization leads to increase in accidents and traffic congestion in junction areas resulting in delayed travel time. In order to solve these problems, an intelligent system utilizing automatic detection and tracking system is significant. But this becomes a challenging task at road intersection areas which require a wide range of field view. For this reason, fish eye cameras are widely used in real time vehicle detection purpose to provide large area coverage and 360 degree view at junctions. However, it introduces challenges such as light glare from vehicles and street lights, shadow, non-linear distortion, scaling issues of vehicles and proper localization of small vehicles. To overcome each of these challenges, a modified YOLOv5 object detection scheme is proposed. YOLOv5 is a deep learning oriented convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detection method. The proposed scheme for detecting vehicles in fish-eye images consists of a light-weight day-night CNN classifier so that two different solutions can be implemented to address the day-night detection issues. Furthurmore, challenging instances are upsampled in the dataset for proper localization of vehicles and later on the detection model is ensembled and trained in different combination of vehicle datasets for better generalization, detection and accuracy. For testing, a real world fisheye dataset provided by the Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup organizer ISSD has been used which includes images from video clips of different fisheye cameras at junction of different cities during day and night time. Experimental results show that our proposed model has outperformed the YOLOv5 model on the dataset by 13.7% mAP @ 0.5.</p></details> |  | None |

This field faces significant challenges such as occlusions and complex environmental dynamics, impacting model accuracy and efficiency. While traditional approaches have relied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), introducing transformers has brought substantial advancements. This work introduces OneTrack-M, a transformer-based MOT model designed to enhance tracking computational efficiency and accuracy. Our approach simplifies the typical transformer-based architecture by eliminating the need for a decoder model for object detection and tracking. Instead, the encoder alone serves as the backbone for temporal data interpretation, significantly reducing processing time and increasing inference speed. Additionally, we employ innovative data pre-processing and multitask training techniques to address occlusion and diverse objective challenges within a single set of weights. Experimental results demonstrate that OneTrack-M achieves at least 25% faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art models in the literature while maintaining or improving tracking accuracy metrics. These improvements highlight the potential of the proposed solution for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics, where rapid responses are crucial for system effectiveness.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures | None |

In this paper, we address the identification of overtake and lane change maneuvers with a novel object detection approach applied to motion profiles, a compact representation of driving video footage into a single image. To train and test our model we created an internal dataset of motion profile images obtained from a heterogeneous set of dashcam videos, manually labeled with overtake and lane change maneuvers by the ego-vehicle. In addition to a standard object-detection approach, we show how the inclusion of CoordConvolution layers further improves the model performance, in terms of mAP and F1 score, yielding state-of-the art performance when compared to other baselines from the literature. The extremely low computational requirements of the proposed solution make it especially suitable to run in device.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures | None |

Traditional methods often struggle with achieving high accuracy in both object detection and precise pose estimation simultaneously. This study proposes an improved 6D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on the existing 6D-VNet framework, enhanced by integrating a Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) and a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) backbone. By leveraging the strengths of HTC's multi-stage refinement process and HRNet's ability to maintain high-resolution representations, our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and pose estimation precision. Furthermore, we introduce advanced post-processing techniques and a novel model integration strategy that collectively contribute to superior performance on public and private benchmarks. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, making it a valuable contribution to the domain of 6D object detection and pose estimation.</p></details> |  | None |

This assumption has led to extensive research on category bias in datasets with imbalanced instance counts. However, models still exhibit category bias even in datasets where instance counts are relatively balanced, clearly indicating that instance count alone cannot explain this phenomenon. In this work, we first introduce the concept and measurement of category information amount. We observe a significant negative correlation between category information amount and accuracy, suggesting that category information amount more accurately reflects the learning difficulty of a category. Based on this observation, we propose Information Amount-Guided Angular Margin (IGAM) Loss. The core idea of IGAM is to dynamically adjust the decision space of each category based on its information amount, thereby reducing category bias in long-tail datasets. IGAM Loss not only performs well on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as LVIS v1.0 and COCO-LT but also shows significant improvement for underrepresented categories in the non-long-tailed dataset Pascal VOC. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the potential of category information amount as a tool and the generality of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection by Balancing Domain Diversity and Invariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03835v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-domain generalization for object detection (S-DGOD) aims to transfer knowledge from a single source domain to unseen target domains. In recent years, many models have focused primarily on achieving feature invariance to enhance robustness. However, due to the inherent diversity across domains, an excessive emphasis on invariance can cause the model to overlook the actual differences between images. This overemphasis may complicate the training process and lead to a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose the Diversity Invariance Detection Model (DIDM), which focuses on the balance between the diversity of domain-specific and invariance cross domains. Recognizing that domain diversity introduces variations in domain-specific features, we introduce a Diversity Learning Module (DLM). The DLM is designed to preserve the diversity of domain-specific information with proposed feature diversity loss while limiting the category semantics in the features. In addition, to maintain domain invariance, we incorporate a Weighted Aligning Module (WAM), which aligns features without compromising feature diversity. We conducted our model on five distinct datasets, which have illustrated the superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> |  | None |

While other research on MOT dedicated to aerial videos primarily focuses on the academic aspect by developing sophisticated algorithms, there is a lack of attention to the practical aspect of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time MOT framework that integrates Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for efficient and fault-tolerant video stream processing, along with state-of-the-art deep learning models YOLOv8/YOLOv10 and BYTETRACK/BoTSORT for accurate object detection and tracking. Our work highlights the importance of not only the advanced algorithms but also the integration of these methods with scalable and distributed systems. By leveraging these technologies, our system achieves a HOTA of 48.14 and a MOTA of 43.51 on the Visdrone2019-MOT test set while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 28 FPS on a single GPU. Our work demonstrates the potential of big data technologies and deep learning for addressing the challenges of MOT in UAV applications.</p></details> |  | None |

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix</p></details> | None |

This process begins with analysts creating a detailed map of a plant with the coordinates of every solar panel, making it possible to quickly locate and mitigate potential faulty solar panels. However, this task is extremely tedious and is not scalable for the ever increasing capacity of solar power across the globe. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for detecting individual solar panels using a rotated object detection architecture. We evaluate our approach on a diverse dataset of solar power plants collected from across the United States and report a mAP score of 83.3%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches rely on 3D point clouds, which present challenges in encoding efficiency and neural network processing. With the advent of advanced LiDAR sensors like Ouster OS1, which, in addition to 3D point clouds, produce fixed resolution depth, signal, and ambient panoramic 2D images, new opportunities emerge for LiDAR based tasks. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to connect LiDAR data with text by leveraging 2D imagery generated by the OS1 sensor instead of 3D point clouds. Using the Florence 2 large model in a zero-shot setting, we perform image captioning and object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that Florence 2 generates more informative captions and achieves superior performance in object detection tasks compared to existing methods like CLIP. By combining advanced LiDAR sensor data with a large pre-trained model, our approach provides a robust and accurate solution for challenging detection scenarios, including real-time applications requiring high accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data Generation for Hardware-Friendly Post-Training Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22110v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot quantization (ZSQ) using synthetic data is a key approach for post-training quantization (PTQ) under privacy and security constraints. However, existing data generation methods often struggle to effectively generate data suitable for hardware-friendly quantization, where all model layers are quantized. We analyze existing data generation methods based on batch normalization (BN) matching and identify several gaps between synthetic and real data: 1) Current generation algorithms do not optimize the entire synthetic dataset simultaneously; 2) Data augmentations applied during training are often overlooked; and 3) A distribution shift occurs in the final model layers due to the absence of BN in those layers. These gaps negatively impact ZSQ performance, particularly in hardware-friendly quantization scenarios. In this work, we propose Data Generation for Hardware-friendly quantization (DGH), a novel method that addresses these gaps. DGH jointly optimizes all generated images, regardless of the image set size or GPU memory constraints. To address data augmentation mismatches, DGH includes a preprocessing stage that mimics the augmentation process and enhances image quality by incorporating natural image priors. Finally, we propose a new distribution-stretching loss that aligns the support of the feature map distribution between real and synthetic data. This loss is applied to the model's output and can be adapted to various tasks. DGH demonstrates significant improvements in quantization performance across multiple tasks, achieving up to a 30% increase in accuracy for hardware-friendly ZSQ in both classification and object detection, often performing on par with real data.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often rely heavily on robot arm state data and RGB images, leading to overfitting to specific object shapes or positions. To address these limitations, we propose RoboGrasp, a universal grasping policy framework that integrates pretrained grasp detection models with robotic learning. By leveraging robust visual guidance from object detection and segmentation tasks, RoboGrasp significantly enhances grasp precision, stability, and generalizability, achieving up to 34% higher success rates in few-shot learning and grasping box prompt tasks. Built on diffusion-based methods, RoboGrasp is adaptable to various robotic learning paradigms, enabling precise and reliable manipulation across diverse and complex scenarios. This framework represents a scalable and versatile solution for tackling real-world challenges in robotic grasping.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Practical X-ray Gastric Cancer Diagnostic Support Using Refined Stochastic Data Augmentation and Hard Boundary Box Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08158v5)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopy is widely used to diagnose gastric cancer and has a high diagnostic performance, but it must be performed by a physician, which limits the number of people who can be diagnosed. In contrast, gastric X-rays can be taken by radiographers, thus allowing a much larger number of patients to undergo imaging. However, the diagnosis of X-ray images relies heavily on the expertise and experience of physicians, and few machine learning methods have been developed to assist in this process. We propose a novel and practical gastric cancer diagnostic support system for gastric X-ray images that will enable more people to be screened. The system is based on a general deep learning-based object detection model and incorporates two novel techniques: refined probabilistic stomach image augmentation (R-sGAIA) and hard boundary box training (HBBT). R-sGAIA enhances the probabilistic gastric fold region and provides more learning patterns for cancer detection models. HBBT is an efficient training method that improves model performance by allowing the use of unannotated negative (i.e., healthy control) samples, which are typically unusable in conventional detection models. The proposed system achieved a sensitivity (SE) for gastric cancer of 90.2\%, higher than that of an expert (85.5%). Under these conditions, two out of five candidate boxes identified by the system were cancerous (precision = 42.5%), with an image processing speed of 0.51 seconds per image. The system also outperformed methods using the same object detection model and state-of-the-art data augmentation by showing a 5.9-point improvement in the F1 score. In summary, this system efficiently identifies areas for radiologists to examine within a practical time frame, thus significantly reducing their workload.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures | None |

Whereas existing QUBO formulations are less likely to miss occluded objects than NMS, there is room for improvement because existing QUBO formulations naively consider confidence scores and pairwise scores based on spatial overlap between predictions. This study proposes new QUBO formulations that aim to distinguish whether the overlap between predictions is due to the occlusion of objects or due to redundancy in prediction, i.e., multiple predictions for a single object. The proposed QUBO formulation integrates two features into the pairwise score of the existing QUBO formulation: i) the appearance feature calculated by the image similarity metric and ii) the product of confidence scores. These features are derived from the hypothesis that redundant predictions share a similar appearance feature and (partially-) occluded objects have low confidence scores, respectively. The proposed methods demonstrate significant advancement over state-of-the-art QUBO-based suppression without a notable increase in runtime, achieving up to 4.54 points improvement in mAP and 9.89 points gain in mAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages for main contents, 3 pages for appendix, 3 pages for reference</p></details> | None |

To solve existing problems in remote sensing image detection, this article proposes an improved YOLOX model for satellite remote sensing image automatic detection. This model is named RS-YOLOX. To strengthen the feature learning ability of the network, we used Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) in the backbone network of YOLOX and combined the Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) with the neck network of YOLOX. To balance the numbers of positive and negative samples in training, we used the Varifocal Loss function. Finally, to obtain a high-performance remote sensing object detector, we combined the trained model with an open-source framework called Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI). This work evaluated models on three aerial remote sensing datasets (DOTA-v1.5, TGRS-HRRSD, and RSOD). Our comparative experiments demonstrate that our model has the highest accuracy in detecting objects in remote sensing image datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work we analyze the inherent capability of one-stage object detectors to robustly operate in the presence of out-of-distribution (OoD) data. Specifically, we propose a novel detection algorithm for detecting unknown objects in image data, which leverages the features extracted by the model from each sample. Differently from other recent approaches in the literature, our proposal does not require retraining the object detector, thereby allowing for the use of pretrained models. Our proposed OoD detector exploits the application of supervised dimensionality reduction techniques to mitigate the effects of the curse of dimensionality on the features extracted by the model. Furthermore, it utilizes high-resolution feature maps to identify potential unknown objects in an unsupervised fashion. Our experiments analyze the Pareto trade-off between the performance detecting known and unknown objects resulting from different algorithmic configurations and inference confidence thresholds. We also compare the performance of our proposed algorithm to that of logits-based post-hoc OoD methods, as well as possible fusion strategies. Finally, we discuss on the competitiveness of all tested methods against state-of-the-art OoD approaches for object detection models over the recently published Unknown Object Detection benchmark. The obtained results verify that the performance of avant-garde post-hoc OoD detectors can be further improved when combined with our proposed algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 fi...</summary><p>13 figures, 4 tables, under review</p></details> | None |

However, adversarial attacks pose a potential threat to the deep learning COD models, and introduce high output uncertainty. With unknown attack models, it becomes even more challenging to improve COD resiliency and quantify the output uncertainty for highly dynamic perception scenes such as autonomous vehicles. In this study, we propose the Trusted Uncertainty Quantification in Collaborative Perception framework (TUQCP). TUQCP leverages both adversarial training and uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance the adversarial robustness of existing COD models. More specifically, TUQCP first adds perturbations to the shared information of randomly selected agents during object detection collaboration by adversarial training. TUQCP then alleviates the impacts of adversarial attacks by providing output uncertainty estimation through learning-based module and uncertainty calibration through conformal prediction. Our framework works for early and intermediate collaboration COD models and single-agent object detection models. We evaluate TUQCP on V2X-Sim, a comprehensive collaborative perception dataset for autonomous driving, and demonstrate a 80.41% improvement in object detection accuracy compared to the baselines under the same adversarial attacks. TUQCP demonstrates the importance of uncertainty quantification to COD under adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

While existing methods rely on geometric or deep supervised features, only a few attempts have been made to leverage self-supervised learning. In this respect, our paper draws inspiration from Masked Image Modeling (MiM) and extends it to multi-object tasks. While MiM focuses on extracting global image-level representations, it struggles with individual objects within the image. This is detrimental for distance estimation, as objects far away correspond to negligible portions of the image. Conversely, our strategy, termed Masked Object Modeling (MoM), enables a novel application of masking techniques. In a few words, we devise an auxiliary objective that reconstructs the portions of the image pertaining to the objects detected in the scene. The training phase is performed in a single unified stage, simultaneously optimizing the masking objective and the downstream loss (i.e., distance estimation). We evaluate the effectiveness of MoM on a novel reference architecture (DistFormer) on the standard KITTI, NuScenes, and MOTSynth datasets. Our evaluation reveals that our framework surpasses the SoTA and highlights its robust regularization properties. The MoM strategy enhances both zero-shot and few-shot capabilities, from synthetic to real domain.

Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks.

| **[Improving Generalization Ability for 3D Object Detection by Learning Sparsity-invariant Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02322v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, 3D object detection is essential for accurately identifying and tracking objects. Despite the continuous development of various technologies for this task, a significant drawback is observed in most of them-they experience substantial performance degradation when detecting objects in unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the generalization ability for 3D object detection on a single domain. We primarily focus on generalizing from a single source domain to target domains with distinct sensor configurations and scene distributions. To learn sparsity-invariant features from a single source domain, we selectively subsample the source data to a specific beam, using confidence scores determined by the current detector to identify the density that holds utmost importance for the detector. Subsequently, we employ the teacher-student framework to align the Bird's Eye View (BEV) features for different point clouds densities. We also utilize feature content alignment (FCA) and graph-based embedding relationship alignment (GERA) to instruct the detector to be domain-agnostic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to other baselines. Furthermore, our approach even outperforms certain domain adaptation methods that can access to the target domain data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025.

In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate that META exhibits superior generalization capability and stronger adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[INTACT: Inducing Noise Tolerance through Adversarial Curriculum Training for LiDAR-based Safety-Critical Perception and Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01896v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present INTACT, a novel two-phase framework designed to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against noisy LiDAR data in safety-critical perception tasks. INTACT combines meta-learning with adversarial curriculum training (ACT) to systematically address challenges posed by data corruption and sparsity in 3D point clouds. The meta-learning phase equips a teacher network with task-agnostic priors, enabling it to generate robust saliency maps that identify critical data regions. The ACT phase leverages these saliency maps to progressively expose a student network to increasingly complex noise patterns, ensuring targeted perturbation and improved noise resilience. INTACT's effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on object detection, tracking, and classification benchmarks using diverse datasets, including KITTI, Argoverse, and ModelNet40. Results indicate that INTACT improves model robustness by up to 20% across all tasks, outperforming standard adversarial and curriculum training methods. This framework not only addresses the limitations of conventional training strategies but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world deployment in resource-constrained safety-critical systems. INTACT's principled integration of meta-learning and adversarial training establishes a new paradigm for noise-tolerant 3D perception in safety-critical applications. INTACT improved KITTI Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) by 9.6% (64.1% -> 75.1%) and by 12.4% under Gaussian noise (52.5% -> 73.7%). Similarly, KITTI mean Average Precision (mAP) rose from 59.8% to 69.8% (50% point drop) and 49.3% to 70.9% (Gaussian noise), highlighting the framework's ability to enhance deep learning model resilience in safety-critical object tracking scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation, a concise view of the environment that can be used to plan a vehicle's trajectory. However, this representation is not fully supported by existing datasets, and creation of new datasets can be a time-consuming endeavor. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce SimBEV, an extensively configurable and scalable randomized synthetic data generation tool that incorporates information from multiple sources to capture accurate BEV ground truth data, supports a comprehensive array of sensors, and enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation and 3D object detection. We use SimBEV to create the SimBEV dataset, a large collection of annotated perception data from diverse driving scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reliability-Driven LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Robust 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01856v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving, where fusing data from sensors like LiDAR and camera enhances detection accuracy. However, sensor malfunctions such as corruption or disconnection can degrade performance, and existing fusion models often struggle to maintain reliability when one modality fails. To address this, we propose ReliFusion, a novel LiDAR-camera fusion framework operating in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space. ReliFusion integrates three key components: the Spatio-Temporal Feature Aggregation (STFA) module, which captures dependencies across frames to stabilize predictions over time; the Reliability module, which assigns confidence scores to quantify the dependability of each modality under challenging conditions; and the Confidence-Weighted Mutual Cross-Attention (CW-MCA) module, which dynamically balances information from LiDAR and camera modalities based on these confidence scores. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ReliFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior robustness and accuracy in scenarios with limited LiDAR fields of view and severe sensor malfunctions.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, using regression loss functions based on Gaussian distributions has become attractive since they yield simple and differentiable terms. However, existing solutions are still based on regression heads that produce Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs), and the known problem of angular boundary discontinuity persists. In this work, we propose a regression head for OOD that directly produces Gaussian distributions based on the Cholesky matrix decomposition. The proposed head, named GauCho, theoretically mitigates the boundary discontinuity problem and is fully compatible with recent Gaussian-based regression loss functions. Furthermore, we advocate using Oriented Ellipses (OEs) to represent oriented objects, which relates to GauCho through a bijective function and alleviates the encoding ambiguity problem for circular objects. Our experimental results show that GauCho can be a viable alternative to the traditional OBB head, achieving results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art detectors for the challenging dataset DOTA</p></details> |  | None |

However, since AI is the core enabling technology, this raises serious cyber threats that hinder the large-scale adoption of AVs. Therefore, it becomes crucial to analyze the resilience of AV security systems against sophisticated attacks that manipulate camera inputs, deceiving AI models. In this paper, we develop camera-camouflaged adversarial attacks targeting traffic sign recognition (TSR) in AVs. Specifically, if the attack is initiated by modifying the texture of a stop sign to fool the AV's object detection system, thereby affecting the AV actuators. The attack's effectiveness is tested using the CARLA AV simulator and the results show that such an attack can delay the auto-braking response to the stop sign, resulting in potential safety issues. We conduct extensive experiments under various conditions, confirming that our new attack is effective and robust. Additionally, we address the attack by presenting mitigation strategies. The proposed attack and defense methods are applicable to other end-to-end trained autonomous cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  | None |

While significant progress has been made in this field, the effects of viewpoint shifts on depth estimation models remain largely underexplored. This paper introduces a novel dataset and evaluation methodology to quantify the impact of different camera positions and orientations on monocular depth estimation performance. We propose a ground truth strategy based on homography estimation and object detection, eliminating the need for expensive LIDAR sensors. We collect a diverse dataset of road scenes from multiple viewpoints and use it to assess the robustness of a modern depth estimation model to geometric shifts. After assessing the validity of our strategy on a public dataset, we provide valuable insights into the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of considering viewpoint variations in real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, thorough research remains difficult, particularly due to the lack of benchmark datasets. In this study, we propose a high-quality dataset automated cropping and filtering (HQ-ACF) pipeline. This pipeline leverages existing object detection datasets and other unlabeled images to automatically crop and filter high-quality human images. Using this pipeline, we constructed a person-based restoration with sophisticated objects and natural activities (\emph{PERSONA}) dataset, which includes training, validation, and test sets. The dataset significantly surpasses other human-related datasets in both quality and content richness. Finally, we propose \emph{OSDHuman}, a novel one-step diffusion model for human body restoration. Specifically, we propose a high-fidelity image embedder (HFIE) as the prompt generator to better guide the model with low-quality human image information, effectively avoiding misleading prompts.

The ability to identify such concepts and their characteristics without supervision has the potential to improve pre-training methods, and enable novel applications such as fine-grained image retrieval and concept-based outlier detection. In this paper, we introduce ConceptVAE, a novel pre-training framework that detects and disentangles fine-grained concepts from their style characteristics in a self-supervised manner. We present a suite of loss terms and model architecture primitives designed to discretise input data into a preset number of concepts along with their local style. We validate ConceptVAE both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its ability to detect fine-grained anatomical structures such as blood pools and septum walls from 2D cardiac echocardiographies. Quantitatively, ConceptVAE outperforms traditional self-supervised methods in tasks such as region-based instance retrieval, semantic segmentation, out-of-distribution detection, and object detection. Additionally, we explore the generation of in-distribution synthetic data that maintains the same concepts as the training data but with distinct styles, highlighting its potential for more calibrated data generation. Overall, our study introduces and validates a promising new pre-training technique based on concept-style disentanglement, opening multiple avenues for developing models for medical image analysis that are more interpretable and explainable than black-box approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Feature Fusion for UAV Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17983v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images poses significant challenges due to unstable image quality, small object sizes, complex backgrounds, and environmental occlusions. Small objects, in particular, occupy small portions of images, making their accurate detection highly difficult. Existing multi-scale feature fusion methods address these challenges to some extent by aggregating features across different resolutions. However, they often fail to effectively balance the classification and localization performance for small objects, primarily due to insufficient feature representation and imbalanced network information flow. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion framework specifically designed for UAV object detection tasks to enhance both localization accuracy and classification performance. The proposed framework integrates hybrid upsampling and downsampling modules, enabling feature maps from different network depths to be flexibly adjusted to arbitrary resolutions. This design facilitates cross-layer connections and multi-scale feature fusion, ensuring improved representation of small objects. Our approach leverages hybrid downsampling to enhance fine-grained feature representation, improving spatial localization of small targets, even under complex conditions. Simultaneously, the upsampling module aggregates global contextual information, optimizing feature consistency across scales and enhancing classification robustness in cluttered scenes. Experimental results on two public UAV datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Integrated into the YOLO-v10 model, our method achieves a 2% improvement in average precision (AP) compared to the baseline YOLO-v10 model, while maintaining the same number of parameters. These results highlight the potential of our framework for accurate and efficient UAV object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many contemporary applications involve both classification and regression in an interdependent manner. In this work, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer framework for multi-task learning that jointly addresses these tasks. Our approach leverages a two-stage surrogate loss family, which we prove to be both ($\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R}$)-consistent and Bayes-consistent, providing strong theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Bayes-optimal rejector. We establish consistency bounds explicitly linked to the cross-entropy surrogate family and the $L_1$-norm of the agents' costs, extending the theoretical minimizability gap analysis to the two-stage setting with multiple experts. We validate our framework on two challenging tasks: object detection, where classification and regression are tightly coupled, and existing methods fail, and electronic health record analysis, in which we highlight the suboptimality of current learning-to-defer approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 17 main paper</p></details> | None |

Friction can be increased to grip securely and then decreased to gently release (e.g., for handovers) or manipulate in-hand. Recent friction-tuning surface designs using soft pneumatic chambers show good control over grip friction; however, most require complex fabrication processes and/or custom gripper hardware. We present a practical structured fingerpad design for friction tuning that uses less than \$1 USD of materials, takes only seconds to repair, and is easily adapted to existing grippers. Our design uses surface morphology changes to tune friction. The fingerpad is actuated by pressurizing its internal chambers, thereby deflecting its flexible grip surface out from or into these chambers. We characterize the friction-tuning capabilities of our design by measuring the shear force required to pull an object from a gripper equipped with two independently actuated fingerpads. Our results show that varying actuation pressure and timing changes the magnitude of friction forces on a gripped object by up to a factor of 2.8. We demonstrate additional features including macro-scale interlocking behaviour and pressure-based object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft). 7 pages, 10 figures</p></details> | None |

Mamba, unlike Vision Transformers, achieves linear complexity for token interactions through a recurrent hidden state process. This sequential processing is enhanced by a parallel scan algorithm, which reduces the computational time of recurrent steps from $L$ sequential steps to $log(L)$ parallel steps with respect to the number of input tokens ($L$). In this work, we propose Fast Vision Mamba (FastVim), that further reduces the computational time of the SSM block by reducing the number of recurrent steps in Vision Mamba models while still retaining model performance. By alternately pooling tokens along image dimensions across Mamba blocks, we obtain a 2$\times$ reduction in the number of parallel steps in SSM block. Our model offers up to $72.5\%$ speedup in inference speed compared to baseline Vision Mamba models on high resolution (2048$\times$2048) images.

Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is the process of selecting a single representative candidate within this cluster of detections, so as to obtain a unique detection per object appearing on a given picture. In this paper, we present a highly scalable NMS algorithm for embedded GPU architectures that is designed from scratch to handle workloads featuring thousands of simultaneous detections on a given picture. Our kernels are directly applicable to other sequential NMS algorithms such as FeatureNMS, Soft-NMS or AdaptiveNMS that share the inner workings of the classic greedy NMS method. The obtained performance results show that our parallel NMS algorithm is capable of clustering 1024 simultaneous detected objects per frame in roughly 1 ms on both NVIDIA Tegra X1 and NVIDIA Tegra X2 on-die GPUs, while taking 2 ms on NVIDIA Tegra K1. Furthermore, our proposed parallel greedy NMS algorithm yields a 14x-40x speed up when compared to state-of-the-art NMS methods that require learning a CNN from annotated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/hertasecurity/gpu-nms</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/hertasecurity/gpu-nms) |

Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, which often suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and rely on multi-stage object detection pipelines, this study employs a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model as the backbone, which excels at capturing global features for depth estimation. It integrates a detection transformer (DETR) architecture to improve both depth estimation and object detection performance in a one-stage manner. Specifically, a hierarchical feature fusion block is introduced to extract richer visual features from the foundation model, further enhancing feature extraction capabilities. Depth estimation accuracy is further improved by incorporating a relative depth estimation model trained on large-scale data and fine-tuning it through transfer learning. Additionally, the use of queries in the transformer's decoder, which consider reference points and the dimensions of 2D bounding boxes, enhances recognition performance. The proposed model outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the KITTI 3D benchmark and a custom dataset collected from high-elevation racing environments.

Most object detection algorithms are based on deep learning for superior performance. However, their black-box nature makes it challenging to ensure safety. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind methodology for analyzing the influence of various factors related to the objects or the environment on the detection performance of both LiDAR- and camera-based 3D object detectors. We conduct a statistical univariate analysis between each factor and the detection error on pedestrians to compare their strength of influence. In addition to univariate analysis, we employ a Random Forest (RF) model to predict the errors of specific detectors based on the provided meta-information. To interpret the predictions of the RF and assess the importance of individual features, we compute Shapley Values. By considering feature dependencies, the RF captures more complex relationships between meta-information and detection errors, allowing a more nuanced analysis of the factors contributing to the observed errors. Recognizing the factors that influence detection performance helps identify performance insufficiencies in the trained object detector and supports the safe development of object detection systems.</p></details> |  | None |

MLMs developed for remote sensing (RS) have demonstrated outstanding performance in multiple tasks, such as visual question answering and visual grounding. In addition to visual grounding that detects specific objects corresponded to given instruction, aerial detection, which detects all objects of multiple categories, is also a valuable and challenging task for RS foundation models. However, aerial detection has not been explored by existing RS MLMs because the autoregressive prediction mechanism of MLMs differs significantly from the detection outputs. In this paper, we present a simple baseline for applying MLMs to aerial detection for the first time, named LMMRotate. Specifically, we first introduce a normalization method to transform detection outputs into textual outputs to be compatible with the MLM framework. Then, we propose a evaluation method, which ensures a fair comparison between MLMs and conventional object detection models. We construct the baseline by fine-tuning open-source general-purpose MLMs and achieve impressive detection performance comparable to conventional detector. We hope that this baseline will serve as a reference for future MLM development, enabling more comprehensive capabilities for understanding RS images.

For the first time, we harness this expressive potential to improve segmentation performance in challenging tasks like camouflaged object detection (COD). Our approach introduces an innovative sketch-guided interactive segmentation framework, allowing users to intuitively annotate objects with freehand sketches (drawing a rough contour of the object) instead of the traditional bounding boxes or points used in classic interactive segmentation models like SAM. We demonstrate that sketch input can significantly improve performance in existing iterative segmentation methods, outperforming text or bounding box annotations. Additionally, we introduce key modifications to network architectures and a novel sketch augmentation technique to fully harness the power of sketch input and further boost segmentation accuracy. Remarkably, our model' s output can be directly used to train other neural networks, achieving results comparable to pixel-by-pixel annotations--while reducing annotation time by up to 120 times, which shows great potential in democratizing the annotation process and enabling model training with less reliance on resource-intensive, laborious pixel-level annotations.

BiSSL formulates the pretext and downstream task objectives as the lower- and upper-level objectives in a bilevel optimization problem and serves as an intermediate training stage within the self-supervised learning pipeline. By explicitly modeling the interdependence of these training stages, BiSSL facilitates enhanced information sharing between them, ultimately leading to a backbone parameter initialization that is better aligned for the downstream task. We propose a versatile training algorithm that alternates between optimizing the two objectives defined in BiSSL, which is applicable to a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pre-train ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Visualizations of the backbone features provide further evidence that BiSSL improves the downstream task alignment of the backbone features prior to fine-tuning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, deep learning models can be influenced by the color quality of the dataset used to train them, impacting detection, segmentation and classification tasks. In this work, we evaluate the impact of color correction on pathology detection using two prominent object detection models: Retinanet and YOLOv5. We first generate two color corrected versions of a popular WCE dataset (i.e., SEE-AI dataset) using two different color correction functions. We then evaluate the performance of the Retinanet and YOLOv5 on the original and color corrected versions of the dataset. The results reveal that color correction makes the models generate larger bounding boxes and larger intersection areas with the ground truth annotations. Furthermore, color correction leads to an increased number of false positives for certain pathologies. However, these effects do not translate into a consistent improvement in performance metrics such as F1-scores, IoU, and AP50. The code is available at https://github.com/agossouema2011/WCE2024.

However, processing such high-density data demands substantial computational resources and energy consumption. We propose SpikingRTNH, the first spiking neural network (SNN) for 3D object detection using 4D Radar data. By replacing conventional ReLU activation functions with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons, SpikingRTNH achieves significant energy efficiency gains. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce biological top-down inference (BTI), which processes point clouds sequentially from higher to lower densities. This approach effectively utilizes points with lower noise and higher importance for detection. Experiments on K-Radar dataset demonstrate that SpikingRTNH with BTI significantly reduces energy consumption by 78% while achieving comparable detection performance to its ANN counterpart (51.1% AP 3D, 57.0% AP BEV). These results establish the viability of SNNs for energy-efficient 4D Radar-based object detection in autonomous driving systems.

In particular, Weligama Coconut Leaf Wilt Disease (WCWLD) and Coconut Caterpillar Infestation (CCI) damage coconut trees, causing severe coconut production loss in Sri Lanka and nearby coconut-producing countries. Currently, both WCWLD and CCI are detected through on-field human observations, a process that is not only time-consuming but also limits the early detection of infections. This paper presents a study conducted in Sri Lanka, demonstrating the effectiveness of employing transfer learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Mask Region-based-CNN (Mask R-CNN) to identify WCWLD and CCI at their early stages and to assess disease progression. Further, this paper presents the use of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection model to count the number of caterpillars distributed on leaves with CCI. The introduced methods were tested and validated using datasets collected from Matara, Puttalam, and Makandura, Sri Lanka. The results show that the proposed methods identify WCWLD and CCI with an accuracy of 90% and 95%, respectively. In addition, the proposed WCWLD disease severity identification method classifies the severity with an accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, the accuracies of the object detection models for calculating the number of caterpillars in the leaflets were: YOLOv5-96.87%, YOLOv8-96.1%, and YOLO11-95.9%.</p></details> |  | None |

Actually, it is very difficult to find in the literature a systematic heuristic that solves the problem for any desired application. In this paper we present a tuning parametes heuristic for the biases of event cameras, for tasks that require small objects detection in staring scenarios. The main purpose of the heuristic is to squeeze the camera's potential, optimize its performance, and expand its detection capabilities as much as possible. In the presentation, we translate the experimental properties of event camera and systemic constrains into mathematical terms, and show, under certain assumptions, how the multi-variable problem collapses into a two-parameter problem that can be solved experimentally. A main conclusion that will be demonstrated is that for certain desired signals, such as the one provided by an incandescent lamp powered by the periodic electrical grid, the optimal values of the camera are very far from the default values recommended by the manufacturer.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures | None |

| **[Assessing the Capability of YOLO- and Transformer-based Object Detectors for Real-time Weed Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17387v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spot spraying represents an efficient and sustainable method for reducing the amount of pesticides, particularly herbicides, used in agricultural fields. To achieve this, it is of utmost importance to reliably differentiate between crops and weeds, and even between individual weed species in situ and under real-time conditions. To assess suitability for real-time application, different object detection models that are currently state-of-the-art are compared. All available models of YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and RT-DETR are trained and evaluated with images from a real field situation. The images are separated into two distinct datasets: In the initial data set, each species of plants is trained individually; in the subsequent dataset, a distinction is made between monocotyledonous weeds, dicotyledonous weeds, and three chosen crops. The results demonstrate that while all models perform equally well in the metrics evaluated, the YOLOv9 models, particularly the YOLOv9s and YOLOv9e, stand out in terms of their strong recall scores (66.58 % and 72.36 %), as well as mAP50 (73.52 % and 79.86 %), and mAP50-95 (43.82 % and 47.00 %) in dataset 2. However, the RT-DETR models, especially RT-DETR-l, excel in precision with reaching 82.44 \% on dataset 1 and 81.46 % in dataset 2, making them particularly suitable for scenarios where minimizing false positives is critical. In particular, the smallest variants of the YOLO models (YOLOv8n, YOLOv9t, and YOLOv10n) achieve substantially faster inference times down to 7.58 ms for dataset 2 on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU for analyzing one frame, while maintaining competitive accuracy, highlighting their potential for deployment in resource-constrained embedded computing devices as typically used in productive setups.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring AI-based System Design for Pixel-level Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09552v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: This study aims to evaluate different setups of an AI-based solution to detect Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical images. Materials and Methods: Text from eight PHI and eight non-PHI categories are simulated and incorporated into a curated dataset comprising 1,000 medical images across four modalities: CT, X-ray, bone scan, and MRI. The proposed PHI detection pipeline comprises three key components: text localization, extraction, and analysis. Three vision and language models, YOLOv11, EasyOCR, and GPT-4o, are benchmarked in different setups corresponding to three key components. The performance is evaluated with classification metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. Results: All four setups demonstrate strong performance in detecting PHI imprints, with all metrics exceeding 0.9. The setup that utilizes YOLOv11 for text localization and GPT-4o for text extraction and analysis achieves the highest performance in PHI detection. However, this setup incurs the highest cost due to the increased number of generated tokens associated with GPT-4o model. Conversely, the setup using solely GPT-4o for the end-to-end pipeline exhibits the lowest performance but showcases the feasibility of multi-modal models in solving complex tasks. Conclusion: For optimal text localization and extraction, it is recommended to fine-tune an object detection model and utilize built-in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Large language models like GPT-4o can be effectively leveraged to reason about and semantically analyze the PHI content. Although the vision capability of GPT-4o is promising for reading image crops, it remains limited for end-to-end pipeline applications with whole images.</p></details> | In progress | None |

However, existing monocular detection methods designed for vehicle cameras are not suitable for roadside cameras due to viewpoint domain gaps. To bridge this gap and Improve ROAdside Monocular 3D object detection, we propose IROAM, a semantic-geometry decoupled contrastive learning framework, which takes vehicle-side and roadside data as input simultaneously. IROAM has two significant modules. In-Domain Query Interaction module utilizes a transformer to learn content and depth information for each domain and outputs object queries. Cross-Domain Query Enhancement To learn better feature representations from two domains, Cross-Domain Query Enhancement decouples queries into semantic and geometry parts and only the former is used for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IROAM in improving roadside detector's performance. The results validate that IROAM has the capabilities to learn cross-domain information.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, ICRA2025</p></details> | None |

Fusion of these modalities further enhances accuracy, but existing methods often introduce complexity or dataset-specific dependencies. In our study, we propose a model-adaptive late-fusion method, VaLID, which validates whether each predicted bounding box is acceptable or not. Our method verifies the higher-performing, yet overly optimistic LiDAR model detections using camera detections that are obtained from either specially trained, general, or open-vocabulary models. VaLID uses a simple multi-layer perceptron trained with a high recall bias to reduce the false predictions made by the LiDAR detector, while still preserving the true ones. Evaluating with multiple combinations of LiDAR and camera detectors on the KITTI dataset, we reduce false positives by an average of 63.9%, thus outperforming the individual detectors on 3D average precision (3DAP). Our approach is model-adaptive and demonstrates state-of-the-art competitive performance even when using generic camera detectors that were not trained specifically for this dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Radar serves as a reliable and low-cost sensor that can effectively complement these limitations. However, radar-based object detection has been underexplored due to the inherent weaknesses of radar data, such as low resolution, high noise, and lack of visual information. In this paper, we present TransRAD, a novel 3D radar object detection model designed to address these challenges by leveraging the Retentive Vision Transformer (RMT) to more effectively learn features from information-dense radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) data. Our approach leverages the Retentive Manhattan Self-Attention (MaSA) mechanism provided by RMT to incorporate explicit spatial priors, thereby enabling more accurate alignment with the spatial saliency characteristics of radar targets in RAD data and achieving precise 3D radar detection across Range-Azimuth-Doppler dimensions. Furthermore, we propose Location-Aware NMS to effectively mitigate the common issue of duplicate bounding boxes in deep radar object detection. The experimental results demonstrate that TransRAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both 2D and 3D radar detection tasks, achieving higher accuracy, faster inference speed, and reduced computational complexity.

AMAs employ multi-object detection (MOD) from multiple cameras to identify nearby objects while ensuring two essential objectives, (R1) timing guarantee and (R2) high accuracy for safety. In this paper, we propose RT-SNN, the first system design, aiming at achieving R1 and R2 in SNN-based MOD systems on AMAs. Leveraging the characteristic that SNNs gather feature data of input image termed as membrane potential, through iterative computation over multiple timesteps, RT-SNN provides multiple execution options with adjustable timesteps and a novel method for reusing membrane potential to support R1. Then, it captures how these execution strategies influence R2 by introducing a novel notion of mean absolute error and membrane confidence. Further, RT-SNN develops a new scheduling framework consisting of offline schedulability analysis for R1 and a run-time scheduling algorithm for R2 using the notion of membrane confidence. We deployed RT-SNN to Spiking-YOLO, the SNN-based MOD model derived from ANN-to-SNN conversion, and our experimental evaluation confirms its effectiveness in meeting the R1 and R2 requirements while providing significant energy efficiency.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

However, the intricate nature of point-cloud data poses significant challenges for human-supervised labeling, resulting in substantial expenditures of time and capital. This paper addresses the issue by developing an end-to-end, scalable, and self-supervised framework for training deep object detectors tailored for roadside point-cloud data. The proposed framework leverages self-supervised, statistically modeled teachers to train off-the-shelf deep object detectors, thus circumventing the need for human supervision. The teacher models follow fine-tuned set standard practices of background filtering, object clustering, bounding-box fitting, and classification to generate noisy labels. It is presented that by training the student model over the combined noisy annotations from multitude of teachers enhances its capacity to discern background/foreground more effectively and forces it to learn diverse point-cloud-representations for object categories of interest. The evaluations, involving publicly available roadside datasets and state-of-art deep object detectors, demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves comparable performance to deep object detectors trained on human-annotated labels, despite not utilizing such human-annotations in its training process.</p></details> | conference, 6 pages | None |

Traditional standards, like DO 178C, which are used for critical software in aviation, do not fully cover the unique aspects of ML. This paper proposes a semi automated certification approach, specifically for low criticality ML systems, focusing on data and model validation, resilience assessment, and usability assurance while integrating manual and automated processes. Key aspects include structured classification to guide certification rigor on system attributes, an Assurance Profile that consolidates evaluation outcomes into a confidence measure the ML component, and methodologies for integrating human oversight into certification activities.

Most existing open-vocabulary object detectors attempt to utilize the pre-trained VLM to attain generative representation. F-ViT uses the pre-trained visual encoder as the backbone network and freezes it during training. However, the frozen backbone doesn't benefit from the labeled data to strengthen the representation. Therefore, we propose a novel two-branch backbone network design, named as ViT-Feature-Modulated Multi-Scale Convolutional network (VMCNet). VMCNet consists of a trainable convolutional branch, a frozen pre-trained ViT branch and a feature modulation module. The trainable CNN branch could be optimized with labeled data while the frozen pre-trained ViT branch could keep the representation ability derived from large-scale pre-training. Then, the proposed feature modulation module could modulate the multi-scale CNN features with the representations from ViT branch. With the proposed mixed structure, detector is more likely to discover novel categories. Evaluated on two popular benchmarks, our method boosts the detection performance on novel category and outperforms the baseline. On OV-COCO, the proposed method achieves 44.3 AP$_{50}^{\mathrm{novel}}$ with ViT-B/16 and 48.5 AP$_{50}^{\mathrm{novel}}$ with ViT-L/14. On OV-LVIS, VMCNet with ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/14 reaches 27.8 and 38.4 mAP$_{r}$.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods often rely on outlier exclusions or semantic segmentations, which suffer from low computational efficiency and accuracy. The proposed SSF-PAN can achieve the functionalities of LiDAR point cloud based object detection/localization and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) with high computational efficiency and accuracy, enabling map-free navigation frameworks. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a neural network which can achieve segmentation among static and dynamic objects within the scene flows with different motion features, that is, semantic scene flow (SSF); 2) developing an iterative framework which can further optimize the quality of input scene flows and output segmentation results; 3) developing a scene flow-based navigation platform which can test the performance of the SSF perception system in the simulation environment. The proposed SSF-PAN method is validated using the SUScape-CARLA and the KITTI datasets, as well as on the CARLA simulator.

Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios.

DebugAgent first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, DebugAgent extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that DebugAgent not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

We observe that features of the same category are more tightly clustered in feature space, while those of different categories are more dispersed. Based on this, we propose using prototype similarity for OOD detection. Drawing on widely used prototype features in few-shot learning, we introduce a novel OOD detection network structure (Proto-OOD). Proto-OOD enhances the representativeness of category prototypes using contrastive loss and detects OOD data by evaluating the similarity between input features and category prototypes. During training, Proto-OOD generates OOD samples for training the similarity module with a negative embedding generator. When Pascal VOC are used as the in-distribution dataset and MS-COCO as the OOD dataset, Proto-OOD significantly reduces the FPR (false positive rate). Moreover, considering the limitations of existing evaluation metrics, we propose a more reasonable evaluation protocol. The code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, SNNs have made considerable advancements in computer vision. However, efficiently conducting feature extraction and fusion under the spiking characteristics of SNNs for object detection remains a pressing challenge. To address this problem, we propose the SpikSSD, a novel Spiking Single Shot Multibox Detector. Specifically, we design a full-spiking backbone network, MDS-ResNet, which effectively adjusts the membrane synaptic input distribution at each layer, achieving better spiking feature extraction. Additionally, for spiking feature fusion, we introduce the Spiking Bi-direction Fusion Module (SBFM), which for the first time realizes bi-direction fusion of spiking features, enhancing the multi-scale detection capability of the model. Experimental results show that SpikSSD achieves 40.8% mAP on the GEN1 dataset, 76.3% and 52.4% mAP@0.5 on VOC 2007 and COCO 2017 datasets respectively with the lowest firing rate, outperforming existing SNN-based approaches at ultralow energy consumption.

Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, we expand it to other tasks, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks. This paper demonstrates the great potential of multi-aspect knowledge distillation, and we believe it offers a promising direction for future research in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

However, traditional CT imaging methods suffered from cumbersome procedures, low detection rates, and poor localization accuracy. The subtle differences between pulmonary nodules and surrounding tissues in complex lung CT images, combined with repeated downsampling in feature extraction networks, often lead to missed or false detections of small nodules. Existing methods such as FPN, with its fixed feature fusion and limited receptive field, struggle to effectively overcome these issues. To address these challenges, our paper proposed three key contributions: Firstly, we proposed MSDet, a multiscale attention and receptive field network for detecting tiny pulmonary nodules. Secondly, we proposed the extended receptive domain (ERD) strategy to capture richer contextual information and reduce false positives caused by nodule occlusion. We also proposed the position channel attention mechanism (PCAM) to optimize feature learning and reduce multiscale detection errors, and designed the tiny object detection block (TODB) to enhance the detection of tiny nodules. Lastly, we conducted thorough experiments on the public LUNA16 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP improvement of 8.8% over the previous state-of-the-art method YOLOv8. These advancements significantly boosted detection accuracy and reliability, providing a more effective solution for early lung cancer diagnosis.

However, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to high-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT.

However, its adoption remains limited, primarily because of the challenges associated with image interpretation and the steep learning curve required for effective use. This study aimed to enhance the interpretability of ioUS images by developing a real-time brain tumor detection system deployable in the operating room. We collected 2D ioUS images from the Brain Tumor Intraoperative Database (BraTioUS) and the public ReMIND dataset, annotated with expert-refined tumor labels. Using the YOLO11 architecture and its variants, we trained object detection models to identify brain tumors. The dataset included 1,732 images from 192 patients, divided into training, validation, and test sets. Data augmentation expanded the training set to 11,570 images. In the test dataset, YOLO11s achieved the best balance of precision and computational efficiency, with a mAP@50 of 0.95, mAP@50-95 of 0.65, and a processing speed of 34.16 frames per second. The proposed solution was prospectively validated in a cohort of 15 consecutively operated patients diagnosed with brain tumors. Neurosurgeons confirmed its seamless integration into the surgical workflow, with real-time predictions accurately delineating tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of real-time object detection algorithms to enhance ioUS-guided brain tumor surgery, addressing key challenges in interpretation and providing a foundation for future development of computer vision-based tools for neuro-oncological surgery.</p></details> |  | None |

However, traditional active learning approaches solely rely on a small amount of labeled data to train an initial model for data selection, overlooking the potential of leveraging the abundance of unlabeled data. Recently, attempts to integrate semi-supervised learning (SSL) into AL with the goal of leveraging unlabeled data have faced challenges in effectively resolving the conflict between the two paradigms, resulting in less satisfactory performance. To tackle this conflict, we propose a Synergistic Semi-Supervised Active Learning framework, dubbed as S-SSAL. Specifically, from the perspective of SSL, we propose a Collaborative PseudoScene Pre-training (CPSP) method that effectively learns from unlabeled data without introducing adverse effects. From the perspective of AL, we design a Collaborative Active Learning (CAL) method, which complements the uncertainty and diversity methods by model cascading. This allows us to fully exploit the potential of the CPSP pre-trained model. Extensive experiments conducted on KITTI and Waymo demonstrate the effectiveness of our S-SSAL framework. Notably, on the KITTI dataset, utilizing only 2% labeled data, S-SSAL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on the full dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Applications of such systems have witnessed significant advancements in recent years in fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, and post-disaster rescue. The system design at this scale puts stringent constraints on power consumption for both the sensory front-end and actuation back-end and the weight of the electronic assembly for robust operation. In this paper, we introduce FAVbot, the first autonomous mobile micro-robotic system integrated with a novel actuation mechanism and convolutional neural network (CNN) based computer vision - all integrated within a compact 3-cm form factor. The novel actuation mechanism utilizes mechanical resonance phenomenon to achieve frequency-controlled steering with a single piezoelectric actuator. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FAVbot's frequency-controlled actuation, which offers a diverse selection of resonance modes with different motion characteristics. The actuation system is complemented with the vision front-end where a camera along with a microcontroller supports object detection for closed-loop control and autonomous target tracking. This enables adaptive navigation in dynamic environments.

Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception.

This work describes a new application of YOLO-based object detection to isolate and label handwriting patterns (Normal, Reversal, Corrected) within synthetic images that resemble real words. Individual letters are first collected, preprocessed into 32x32 samples, then assembled into larger synthetic 'words' to simulate realistic handwriting. Our YOLOv11 framework simultaneously localizes each letter and classifies it into one of three categories, reflecting key dyslexia traits. Empirically, we achieve near-perfect performance, with precision, recall, and F1 metrics typically exceeding 0.999. This surpasses earlier single-letter approaches that rely on conventional CNNs or transfer-learning classifiers (for example, MobileNet-based methods in Robaa et al. arXiv:2410.19821). Unlike simpler pipelines that consider each letter in isolation, our solution processes complete word images, resulting in more authentic representations of handwriting. Although relying on synthetic data raises concerns about domain gaps, these experiments highlight the promise of YOLO-based detection for faster and more interpretable dyslexia screening. Future work will expand to real-world handwriting, other languages, and deeper explainability methods to build confidence among educators, clinicians, and families.</p></details> |  | None |

One of the main challenges in realizing this paradigm is monitoring materials, since in general, something that is not measured cannot be effectively managed. In this paper, we propose a real-time synchronized object detection framework that enables, at the same time, autonomous sorting, mapping, and quantification of solid materials. We begin by introducing the general framework for real-time wide-area material monitoring, and then, we illustrate it using a numerical example. Finally, we develop a first prototype whose working principle is underpinned by the proposed framework. The prototype detects 4 materials from 5 different models of inhalers and, through a synchronization mechanism, it combines the detection outputs of 2 vision units running at 12-22 frames per second (Fig. 1). This led us to introduce the notion of synchromaterial and to conceive a robotic waste sorter as a node compartment of a material network.

Conventional methods for channel prediction face challenges in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, practicality, and generalizability. Additionally, they often fail to effectively leverage environmental features. Within the framework of integration communication and artificial intelligence as a pivotal development vision for 6G, it is imperative to achieve intelligent prediction of channel characteristics. Vision-aided methods have been employed in various wireless communication tasks, excluding channel prediction, and have demonstrated enhanced efficiency and performance. In this paper, we propose a vision-aided two-stage model for channel prediction in millimeter wave vehicular communication scenarios, realizing accurate received power prediction utilizing solely RGB images. Firstly, we obtain original images of propagation environment through an RGB camera. Secondly, three typical computer vision methods including object detection, instance segmentation and binary mask are employed for environmental information extraction from original images in stage 1, and prediction of received power based on processed images is implemented in stage 2. Pre-trained YOLOv8 and ResNets are used in stages 1 and 2, respectively, and fine-tuned on datasets. Finally, we conduct five experiments to evaluate the performance of proposed model, demonstrating its feasibility, accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Pose errors arising from latency and GPS localization noise further exacerbate the issue by leading to feature misalignment. To overcome these challenges, we propose V2X-DGPE, a high-accuracy and robust V2X feature-level collaborative perception framework. V2X-DGPE employs a Knowledge Distillation Framework and a Feature Compensation Module to learn domain-invariant representations from multi-source data, effectively reducing the feature distribution gap between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Historical information is utilized to provide the model with a more comprehensive understanding of the current scene. Furthermore, a Collaborative Fusion Module leverages a heterogeneous self-attention mechanism to extract and integrate heterogeneous representations from vehicles and infrastructure. To address pose errors, V2X-DGPE introduces a deformable attention mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively focus on critical parts of the input features by dynamically offsetting sampling points. Extensive experiments on the real-world DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance.

A significant challenge lies in the absence of a natural physical backdoor dataset, and constructing such a dataset is both time- and labor-intensive. In this work, we address this gap by creating a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 11,800 images/frames with annotations featuring natural objects (e.g., T-shirts and hats) as triggers to incur cloaking adversarial effects in diverse real-world scenarios. This dataset is tailored for the study of physical backdoors in object detectors. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of an insidious cloaking backdoor effect against object detectors, wherein the bounding box around a person vanishes when the individual is near a natural object (e.g., a commonly available T-shirt) in front of the detector. Our evaluations encompass three prevalent attack surfaces: data outsourcing, model outsourcing, and the use of pretrained models. The cloaking effect is successfully implanted in object detectors across all three attack surfaces. We extensively evaluate four popular object detection algorithms (anchor-based Yolo-V3, Yolo-V4, Faster R-CNN, and anchor-free CenterNet) using 19 videos (totaling approximately 11,800 frames) in real-world scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the backdoor attack exhibits remarkable robustness against various factors, including movement, distance, angle, non-rigid deformation, and lighting. In data and model outsourcing scenarios, the attack success rate (ASR) in most videos reaches 100% or near it, while the clean data accuracy of the backdoored model remains indistinguishable from that of the clean model, making it impossible to detect backdoor behavior through a validation set.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2201.08619</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose S3PT a novel scene semantics and structure guided clustering to provide more scene-consistent objectives for self-supervised training. Specifically, our contributions are threefold: First, we incorporate semantic distribution consistent clustering to encourage better representation of rare classes such as motorcycles or animals. Second, we introduce object diversity consistent spatial clustering, to handle imbalanced and diverse object sizes, ranging from large background areas to small objects such as pedestrians and traffic signs. Third, we propose a depth-guided spatial clustering to regularize learning based on geometric information of the scene, thus further refining region separation on the feature level. Our learned representations significantly improve performance in downstream semantic segmentation and 3D object detection tasks on the nuScenes, nuImages, and Cityscapes datasets and show promising domain translation properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for WACV 2025 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

The development of high-resolution virtual slide scanners offers the possibility of quantifying, robustifying and accelerating the histopathological procedure. A major challenge for machine learning is to control the precision of predictions while enabling a high recall, in order to provide reproducibility. We use a multiple testing procedure that gives an overperforming way to solve the standard Precision-Recall trade-off that gives probabilistic guarantees on the precision. In addition, we significantly improve the overall performance of the models (increase of F1-score) by selecting the decision threshold using contextual biological information or using an auxiliary model. As it is model-agnostic, this contextual selection procedure paves the way to the development of a strategy that can improve the performance of any model without the need of retraining it.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures | None |

In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v3, a stronger single point-supervised OOD framework. Compared to existing methods, it generates pseudo rotated boxes without additional priors and incorporates support for the end-to-end paradigm. PointOBB-v3 functions by integrating three unique image views: the original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Based on the views, a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module are constructed. In the first module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss and a Scale-Sensitive Feature Fusion (SSFF) module are introduced to improve the model's ability to estimate object scale.

Large quantities of recyclable materials are lost to coarse waste, so more effective sorting processes must be developed to recover them. Two key aspects to automate the sorting process are object detection with material classification in mixed piles of waste, and autonomous control of hydraulic machinery.

However, many of these methods remain computationally expensive for spacecraft processors and prevent real-time operation. Training of such algorithms is additionally complex due to the scarcity of labeled data and reliance on supervised learning approaches. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a promising solution by facilitating model training with disparate data sources such as simulations or synthetic scenes, although UDA is difficult to apply to celestial environments where challenging feature spaces are paramount. To alleviate such issues, You Only Crash Once (YOCOv1) has studied the integration of Visual Similarity-based Alignment (VSA) into lightweight one-stage object detection architectures to improve space terrain UDA. Although proven effective, the approach faces notable limitations, including performance degradations in multi-class and high-altitude scenarios. Building upon the foundation of YOCOv1, we propose novel additions to the VSA scheme that enhance terrain detection capabilities under UDA, and our approach is evaluated across both simulated and real-world data. Our second YOCO rendition, YOCOv2, is capable of achieving state-of-the-art UDA performance on surface terrain detection, where we showcase improvements upwards of 31% compared with YOCOv1 and terrestrial state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the practical utility of YOCOv2 with spacecraft flight hardware performance benchmarking and qualitative evaluation of NASA mission data.</p></details> |  | None |

With efficiency being a high priority for scaling such models, we observed that the state-of-the-art method Mask2Former uses 50% of its compute only on the transformer encoder. This is due to the retention of a full-length token-level representation of all backbone feature scales at each encoder layer. With this observation, we propose a strategy termed PROgressive Token Length SCALing for Efficient transformer encoders (PRO-SCALE) that can be plugged-in to the Mask2Former segmentation architecture to significantly reduce the computational cost. The underlying principle of PRO-SCALE is: progressively scale the length of the tokens with the layers of the encoder. This allows PRO-SCALE to reduce computations by a large margin with minimal sacrifice in performance (~52% encoder and ~27% overall GFLOPs reduction with no drop in performance on COCO dataset). Experiments conducted on public benchmarks demonstrates PRO-SCALE's flexibility in architectural configurations, and exhibits potential for extension beyond the settings of segmentation tasks to encompass object detection.

We introduce MONA, a novel framework designed for robust moving object detection and segmentation from videos shot by dynamic cameras. MONA comprises two key modules: Dynamic Points Extraction, which leverages optical flow and tracking any point to identify dynamic points, and Moving Object Segmentation, which employs adaptive bounding box filtering, and the Segment Anything for precise moving object segmentation. We validate MONA by integrating with the camera trajectory estimation method LEAP-VO, and it achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPI Sintel dataset comparing to existing methods. These results demonstrate MONA's effectiveness for moving object detection and its potential in many other applications in the urban planning field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Label Convergence: Defining an Upper Performance Bound in Object Recognition through Contradictory Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09412v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annotation errors are a challenge not only during training of machine learning models, but also during their evaluation. Label variations and inaccuracies in datasets often manifest as contradictory examples that deviate from established labeling conventions. Such inconsistencies, when significant, prevent models from achieving optimal performance on metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP). We introduce the notion of "label convergence" to describe the highest achievable performance under the constraint of contradictory test annotations, essentially defining an upper bound on model accuracy. Recognizing that noise is an inherent characteristic of all data, our study analyzes five real-world datasets, including the LVIS dataset, to investigate the phenomenon of label convergence. We approximate that label convergence is between 62.63-67.52 mAP@[0.5:0.95:0.05] for LVIS with 95% confidence, attributing these bounds to the presence of real annotation errors. With current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models at the upper end of the label convergence interval for the well-studied LVIS dataset, we conclude that model capacity is sufficient to solve current object detection problems. Therefore, future efforts should focus on three key aspects: (1) updating the problem specification and adjusting evaluation practices to account for unavoidable label noise, (2) creating cleaner data, especially test data, and (3) including multi-annotated data to investigate annotation variation and make these issues visible from the outset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025, added reference to paper associated code</p></details> | None |
| **[Large-image Object Detection for Fine-grained Recognition of Punches Patterns in Medieval Panel Painting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12489v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The attribution of the author of an art piece is typically a laborious manual process, usually relying on subjective evaluations of expert figures. However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.</p></details> |  | None |

Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

In response, posterior-based methods such as conditional Diffusion Models and Invertible Neural Networks have emerged; however, their translation is hampered by a lack of research on adequate validation. In other words, the way progress is measured often does not reflect the needs of the driving practical application. Closing this gap in the literature, we present the first systematic framework for the application-driven validation of posterior-based methods in inverse problems. As a methodological novelty, it adopts key principles from the field of object detection validation, which has a long history of addressing the question of how to locate and match multiple object instances in an image. Treating modes as instances enables us to perform mode-centric validation, using well-interpretable metrics from the application perspective. We demonstrate the value of our framework through instantiations for a synthetic toy example and two medical vision use cases: pose estimation in surgery and imaging-based quantification of functional tissue parameters for diagnostics. Our framework offers key advantages over common approaches to posterior validation in all three examples and could thus revolutionize performance assessment in inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Medical Image Analysis.

However, these systems are highly sensitive to input variations, such as noise and changes in lighting, which can compromise their effectiveness and potentially lead to safety-critical failures. This study offers a comprehensive empirical evaluation of image perturbations, techniques commonly used to assess the robustness of DNNs, to validate and improve the robustness and generalization of ADAS perception systems. We first conducted a systematic review of the literature, identifying 38 categories of perturbations. Next, we evaluated their effectiveness in revealing failures in two different ADAS, both at the component and at the system level. Finally, we explored the use of perturbation-based data augmentation and continuous learning strategies to improve ADAS adaptation to new operational design domains. Our results demonstrate that all categories of image perturbations successfully expose robustness issues in ADAS and that the use of dataset augmentation and continuous learning significantly improves ADAS performance in novel, unseen environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 18th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2025)</p></details> | None |

These issues hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous driving.Traditional enhancement techniques, such as multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details and often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images under complex lighting conditions. Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance Network (DLEN), a novel architecture that incorporates two distinct attention mechanisms, considering both spatial and frequency domains. Our model introduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation phase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and texture details. Additionally, we design a dual-branch structure that leverages the power of the Transformer architecture to enhance both the illumination and structural components of the image.Through extensive experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.Code is available here: https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN</p></details> | 10pages,6figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/LaLaLoXX/DLEN) |

Existing methods often fall short in handling high-noise and low-contrast images in complex underwater environments, lacking precision and robustness. This paper introduces a novel SVGS-DSGAT model that combines GraphSage, SVAM, and DSGAT modules, enhancing feature extraction and target detection capabilities through graph neural networks and attention mechanisms. The model integrates IoT technology to facilitate real-time data collection and processing, optimizing resource allocation and model responsiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the SVGS-DSGAT model achieves an mAP of 40.8% on the URPC 2020 dataset and 41.5% on the SeaDronesSee dataset, significantly outperforming existing mainstream models. This IoT-enhanced approach not only excels in high-noise and complex backgrounds but also improves the overall efficiency and scalability of the system.

This strategy involves maintaining two models with identical structures but different initial parameter configurations, which collaborate with each other to select easy samples with prediction confidence exceeding a set threshold for training. As training progresses, the strategy gradually lowers the threshold, allowing more samples to participate, enhancing the model's ability to recognize objects from easy to hard. Before applying the CPL-BC strategy to train the FBOD models, we initially trained the two FBOD models to equip them with the capability to assess the difficulty level of flying bird object samples. Experimental results on two different datasets of flying bird objects in surveillance videos demonstrate that, compared to other model learning strategies, CPL-BC significantly improves detection accuracy, verifying the effectiveness and advancement of this method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SMamba: Sparse Mamba for Event-based Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11971v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in event-based object detection, owing to the global modeling ability. However, they neglect the influence of non-event and noisy regions and process them uniformly, leading to high computational overhead. To mitigate computation cost, some researchers propose window attention based sparsification strategies to discard unimportant regions, which sacrifices the global modeling ability and results in suboptimal performance. To achieve better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose Sparse Mamba (SMamba), which performs adaptive sparsification to reduce computational effort while maintaining global modeling capability. Specifically, a Spatio-Temporal Continuity Assessment module is proposed to measure the information content of tokens and discard uninformative ones by leveraging the spatiotemporal distribution differences between activity and noise events. Based on the assessment results, an Information-Prioritized Local Scan strategy is designed to shorten the scan distance between high-information tokens, facilitating interactions among them in the spatial dimension. Furthermore, to extend the global interaction from 2D space to 3D representations, a Global Channel Interaction module is proposed to aggregate channel information from a global spatial perspective. Results on three datasets (Gen1, 1Mpx, and eTram) demonstrate that our model outperforms other methods in both performance and efficiency.</p></details> | AAAI2025 | None |

To efficiently handle the irregular and sparse nature of point cloud, we propose migrating the voxels into distinct specialized ordered fields with the general spatial expansion strategies, and employ group attention mechanisms to extract the exclusive feature maps within each field. Subsequently, we integrate the feature representations across different ordered fields by alternately applying diverse expansion strategies, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture comprehensive spatial information. The method was evaluated on the nuScenes lidar-based object detection test dataset, achieving an NDS score of 73.9 without Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) and 74.5 with TTA, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, our method ranks the 1st place in the nuScenes lidar-based object detection task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Aerial Monocular 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03974v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones equipped with cameras can significantly enhance human ability to perceive the world because of their remarkable maneuverability in 3D space. Ironically, object detection for drones has always been conducted in the 2D image space, which fundamentally limits their ability to understand 3D scenes. Furthermore, existing 3D object detection methods developed for autonomous driving cannot be directly applied to drones due to the lack of deformation modeling, which is essential for the distant aerial perspective with sensitive distortion and small objects. To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view detection system named DVDET to achieve aerial monocular object detection in both the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view deformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation module that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the BEV. Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a learnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation. To address the dataset challenge, we propose a new large-scale simulation dataset named AM3D-Sim, generated by the co-simulation of AirSIM and CARLA, and a new real-world aerial dataset named AM3D-Real, collected by DJI Matrice 300 RTK, in both datasets, high-quality annotations for 3D object detection are provided. Extensive experiments show that i) aerial monocular 3D object detection is feasible; ii) the model pre-trained on the simulation dataset benefits real-world performance, and iii) DVDET also benefits monocular 3D object detection for cars. To encourage more researchers to investigate this area, we will release the dataset and related code in https://github.com/PhyllisH/DVDET.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/PhyllisH/DVDET) |

Due to the lack of domain-specific pre-trained backbones in SAR images, the traditional strategies are loading the foundation pre-train models of natural scenes such as ImageNet, whose characteristics of images are extremely different from SAR images. This may hinder the model performance on downstream tasks when adopting SFT on small-scale annotated SAR data. In this paper, an self-supervised learning (SSL) method of masked image modeling based on Masked Auto-Encoders (MAE) is proposed to learn feature representations of SAR images during the pre-training process and benefit the object detection task in SAR images of SFT. The evaluation experiments on the large-scale SAR object detection benchmark named SARDet-100k verify that the proposed method captures proper latent representations of SAR images and improves the model generalization in downstream tasks by converting the pre-trained domain from natural scenes to SAR images through SSL. The proposed method achieves an improvement of 1.3 mAP on the SARDet-100k benchmark compared to only the SFT strategies.</p></details> |  | None |

Through an in-depth analysis of FPGA-specific limitations, we identify a set of FPGA-induced constraints that shape the algorithm's design. These include a computational complexity limit of 30 GMACs (billion multiply-accumulate operations), INT8 quantization for weights and activations, 2D cell-based processing instead of 3D voxels, and minimal use of skip connections. To meet these constraints while maximizing performance, LiFT combines novel mechanisms with state-of-the-art techniques such as reparameterizable convolutions and fully sparse architecture. Key innovations include the Dual-bound Pillar Feature Net, which boosts performance without increasing complexity, and an efficient scheme for INT8 quantization of input features. With a computational cost of just 20.73 GMACs, LiFT stands out as one of the few algorithms targeting minimal-complexity 3D object detection.

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an electromagnetic survey technique as advanced non-destructive technology (NDT) that can be used to monitor railway tracks. This technology is well-suited for railway applications due to the sub-layered composition of the track, which includes ties, ballast, sub-ballast, and subgrade regions. It can detect defects such as ballast pockets, fouled ballast, poor drainage, and subgrade settlement. The paper reviews recent works on advanced technology and interpretations of GPR data collected for different layers. Further, this paper demonstrates the current techniques for using synthetic modeling to calibrate real-world GPR data, enhancing accuracy in identifying subsurface features like ballast conditions and structural anomalies and applying various algorithms to refine GPR data analysis. These include Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying railway ballast types, Fuzzy C-means, and Generalized Regression Neural Networks for high-accuracy defect classification. Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are also highlighted for their effectiveness in recognizing patterns associated with defects in GPR images. The article specifically focuses on the development of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model, which combines CNN and RNN architectures for efficient processing of GPR data. This model demonstrates enhanced detection capabilities and faster processing compared to traditional object detection models like Faster R-CNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>2nd C...</summary><p>2nd Canadian & Cold Regions Rail Research Conference 2024 (CCRC 2024)</p></details> | None |

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising for event-based object recognition and detection due to their spiking nature but lack efficient training methods, leading to gradient vanishing and high computational complexity, especially in deep SNNs. Additionally, existing SNN frameworks often fail to effectively handle multi-scale spatiotemporal features, leading to increased data redundancy and reduced accuracy. To address these issues, we propose CREST, a novel conjointly-trained spike-driven framework to exploit spatiotemporal dynamics in event-based object detection. We introduce the conjoint learning rule to accelerate SNN learning and alleviate gradient vanishing. It also supports dual operation modes for efficient and flexible implementation on different hardware types. Additionally, CREST features a fully spike-driven framework with a multi-scale spatiotemporal event integrator (MESTOR) and a spatiotemporal-IoU (ST-IoU) loss. Our approach achieves superior object recognition & detection performance and up to 100X energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art SNN algorithms on three datasets, providing an efficient solution for event-based object detection algorithms suitable for SNN hardware implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

However, analyzing footage from hundreds, if not thousands, of traffic cameras in a 24/7/365 working protocol remains an extremely challenging task, as current vision-based approaches primarily focus on extracting raw information, such as vehicle trajectories or individual object detection, but require laborious post-processing to derive actionable insights. We propose SeeUnsafe, a new framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) agents to transform video-based traffic accident analysis from a traditional extraction-then-explanation workflow to a more interactive, conversational approach. This shift significantly enhances processing throughput by automating complex tasks like video classification and visual grounding, while improving adaptability by enabling seamless adjustments to diverse traffic scenarios and user-defined queries. Our framework employs a severity-based aggregation strategy to handle videos of various lengths and a novel multimodal prompt to generate structured responses for review and evaluation and enable fine-grained visual grounding. We introduce IMS (Information Matching Score), a new MLLM-based metric for aligning structured responses with ground truth. We conduct extensive experiments on the Toyota Woven Traffic Safety dataset, demonstrating that SeeUnsafe effectively performs accident-aware video classification and visual grounding by leveraging off-the-shelf MLLMs. Source code will be available at \url{https://github.com/ai4ce/SeeUnsafe}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/ai4ce/SeeUnsafe) |

However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting.

Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of fusing radar and LiDAR point clouds. However, challenges remain due to the modality misalignment and information loss during feature extractions. To address these issues, we propose a 4D radar-LiDAR framework to mutually enhance their representations. Initially, the indicative features from radar are utilized to guide both radar and LiDAR geometric feature learning. Subsequently, to mitigate their sparsity gap, the shape information from LiDAR is used to enrich radar BEV features. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate our approach's superiority over existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of 71.76% across the entire area and 86.36\% within the driving corridor. Especially for cars, we improve the AP by 4.17% and 4.20% due to the strong indicative features and symmetric shapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |

Despite the revolutionary image generation ability, current state-of-the-art models still struggle to deal with multi-concept generation accurately in many cases. This phenomenon is known as ``concept bleeding" and displays as the unexpected overlapping or merging of various concepts. This paper presents a general approach for text-to-image diffusion models to address the mutual interference between different subjects and their attachments in complex scenes, pursuing better text-image consistency. The core idea is to isolate the synthesizing processes of different concepts. We propose to bind each attachment to corresponding subjects separately with split text prompts. Besides, we introduce a revision method to fix the concept bleeding problem in multi-subject synthesis. We first depend on pre-trained object detection and segmentation models to obtain the layouts of subjects. Then we isolate and resynthesize each subject individually with corresponding text prompts to avoid mutual interference. Overall, we achieve a training-free strategy, named Isolated Diffusion, to optimize multi-concept text-to-image synthesis. It is compatible with the latest Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and prior Stable Diffusion (SD) models. We compare our approach with alternative methods using a variety of multi-concept text prompts and demonstrate its effectiveness with clear advantages in text-image consistency and user study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</p></details> | None |

It aims at adapting a source-pretrained detector to a distinct target domain without resorting to source data during adaptation. So far, there is no data augmentation scheme tailored to source-free domain-adaptive object detection. To this end, this paper presents a novel data augmentation approach that cuts out target image regions where the detector is confident, augments them along with their respective pseudo-labels, and joins them into a challenging target image to adapt the detector. As the source data is out of reach during adaptation, we implement our approach within a teacher-student learning paradigm to ensure that the model does not collapse during the adaptation procedure. We evaluated our approach on three adaptation benchmarks of traffic scenes, scoring new state-of-the-art on two of them.</p></details> |  | None |

Although the amount of information varies across images, most image tokenizers only support fixed-length tokenization, leading to inefficiency in token allocation. In this study, we introduce One-D-Piece, a discrete image tokenizer designed for variable-length tokenization, achieving quality-controllable mechanism. To enable variable compression rate, we introduce a simple but effective regularization mechanism named "Tail Token Drop" into discrete one-dimensional image tokenizers. This method encourages critical information to concentrate at the head of the token sequence, enabling support of variadic tokenization, while preserving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. We evaluate our tokenizer across multiple reconstruction quality metrics and find that it delivers significantly better perceptual quality than existing quality-controllable compression methods, including JPEG and WebP, at smaller byte sizes. Furthermore, we assess our tokenizer on various downstream computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation, confirming its adaptability to numerous applications compared to other variable-rate methods. Our approach demonstrates the versatility of variable-length discrete image tokenization, establishing a new paradigm in both compression efficiency and reconstruction performance. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of tail token drop via detailed analysis of tokenizers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our P...</summary><p>Our Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/one-d-piece-tokenizer</p></details> | [Code Link](https://turingmotors.github.io/one-d-piece-tokenizer) |

However, they encounter numerous challenges that hinder effective feature extraction, including the detection and recognition of multiple objects exhibiting substantial variations in scale within a single image. While prior dual-branch or multi-branch architectural strategies have been effective in managing these object variances, they have concurrently resulted in considerable increases in computational demands and parameter counts. Consequently, these architectures are rendered less viable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Contemporary lightweight backbone networks, designed primarily for natural images, frequently encounter difficulties in effectively extracting features from multi-scale objects, which compromises their efficacy in RS visual tasks. This article introduces LWGANet, a specialized lightweight backbone network tailored for RS visual tasks, incorporating a novel lightweight group attention (LWGA) module designed to address these specific challenges. LWGA module, tailored for RS imagery, adeptly harnesses redundant features to extract a wide range of spatial information, from local to global scales, without introducing additional complexity or computational overhead. This facilitates precise feature extraction across multiple scales within an efficient framework.LWGANet was rigorously evaluated across twelve datasets, which span four crucial RS visual tasks: scene classification, oriented object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection. The results confirm LWGANet's widespread applicability and its ability to maintain an optimal balance between high performance and low complexity, achieving SOTA results across diverse datasets. LWGANet emerged as a novel solution for resource-limited scenarios requiring robust RS image processing capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Remote sensing</p></details> | None |

However, many of these methods rely on the assumption that unlabeled old-class objects may co-occur with labeled new-class objects in the incremental data. When unlabeled old-class objects are absent, the performance of existing methods tends to degrade. The absence can be mitigated by generating old-class samples, but it incurs high costs. This paper argues that previous generation-based IOD suffers from redundancy, both in the use of generative models, which require additional training and storage, and in the overproduction of generated samples, many of which do not contribute significantly to performance improvements. To eliminate the redundancy, we propose Inversed Objects Replay (IOR). Specifically, we generate old-class samples by inversing the original detectors, thus eliminating the necessity of training and storing additional generative models. We propose augmented replay to reuse the objects in generated samples, reducing redundant generations. Moreover, we propose high-value knowledge distillation focusing on the positions of old-class objects overwhelmed by the background, which transfers the knowledge to the incremental detector. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO 2017 demonstrate that our method can efficiently improve detection performance in IOD scenarios with the absence of old-class objects.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike generic object detection, ORA requires both accurate language understanding and precise visual localization, making it inherently more complex. Although recent pre-trained large visual grounding detectors have achieved significant progress, they heavily rely on extensively labeled data and time-consuming learning. To address these, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for zero-shot ORA, termed FLORA (Formal Language for Object Referring and Analysis). FLORA harnesses the inherent reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and integrates a formal language model - a logical framework that regulates language within structured, rule-based descriptions - to provide effective zero-shot ORA. More specifically, our formal language model (FLM) enables an effective, logic-driven interpretation of object descriptions without necessitating any training processes. Built upon FLM-regulated LLM outputs, we further devise a Bayesian inference framework and employ appropriate off-the-shelf interpretive models to finalize the reasoning, delivering favorable robustness against LLM hallucinations and compelling ORA performance in a training-free manner. In practice, our FLORA boosts the zero-shot performance of existing pretrained grounding detectors by up to around 45%. Our comprehensive evaluation across different challenging datasets also confirms that FLORA consistently surpasses current state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in both detection and segmentation tasks associated with zero-shot ORA. We believe our probabilistic parsing and reasoning of the LLM outputs elevate the reliability and interpretability of zero-shot ORA. We shall release codes upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AgRegNet: A Deep Regression Network for Flower and Fruit Density Estimation, Localization, and Counting in Orchards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17400v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the major challenges for the agricultural industry today is the uncertainty in manual labor availability and the associated cost. Automated flower and fruit density estimation, localization, and counting could help streamline harvesting, yield estimation, and crop-load management strategies such as flower and fruitlet thinning. This article proposes a deep regression-based network, AgRegNet, to estimate density, count, and location of flower and fruit in tree fruit canopies without explicit object detection or polygon annotation. Inspired by popular U-Net architecture, AgRegNet is a U-shaped network with an encoder-to-decoder skip connection and modified ConvNeXt-T as an encoder feature extractor. AgRegNet can be trained based on information from point annotation and leverages segmentation information and attention modules (spatial and channel) to highlight relevant flower and fruit features while suppressing non-relevant background features. Experimental evaluation in apple flower and fruit canopy images under an unstructured orchard environment showed that AgRegNet achieved promising accuracy as measured by Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), percentage Mean Absolute Error (pMAE) and mean Average Precision (mAP) to estimate flower and fruit density, count, and centroid location, respectively. Specifically, the SSIM, pMAE, and mAP values for flower images were 0.938, 13.7%, and 0.81, respectively. For fruit images, the corresponding values were 0.910, 5.6%, and 0.93. Since the proposed approach relies on information from point annotation, it is suitable for sparsely and densely located objects. This simplified technique will be highly applicable for growers to accurately estimate yields and decide on optimal chemical and mechanical flower thinning practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> | None |
| **[Practical Continual Forgetting for Pre-trained Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09705v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For privacy and security concerns, the need to erase unwanted information from pre-trained vision models is becoming evident nowadays. In real-world scenarios, erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model owners, and these requests usually form a sequence. Therefore, under such a setting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a pre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as continual forgetting and identify three key challenges. (i) For unwanted knowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining knowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal. (iii) In real-world scenarios, the training samples may be scarce or partially missing during the process of forgetting. To address them, we first propose Group Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we introduce LoRA modules to fine-tune the FFN layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting task independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is adopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out the others. To further extend GS-LoRA to more practical scenarios, we incorporate prototype information as additional supervision and introduce a more practical approach, GS-LoRA++. For each forgotten class, we move the logits away from its original prototype. For the remaining classes, we pull the logits closer to their respective prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments on face recognition, object detection and image classification and demonstrate that our method manages to forget specific classes with minimal impact on other classes.

It is an intricate process which involves the manual identification, classification, and location of multiple sleep event patterns. This is complex, for which identification of different types of events involves focusing on different subsets of signals, resulting on an iterative time-consuming process entailing several visual analysis passes. In this paper we propose a multi-task deep-learning approach for the simultaneous detection of sleep events and hypnogram construction in one single pass. Taking as reference state-of-the-art methodology for object-detection in the field of Computer Vision, we reformulate the problem for the analysis of multi-variate time sequences, and more specifically for pattern detection in the sleep analysis scenario. We investigate the performance of the resulting method in identifying different assembly combinations of EEG arousals, respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) and sleep stages, also considering different input signal montage configurations. Furthermore, we evaluate our approach using two independent datasets, assessing true-generalization effects involving local and external validation scenarios. Based on our results, we analyze and discuss our method's capabilities and its potential wide-range applicability across different settings and datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

By exploiting this camera-LiDAR setup and recent advances in image representation learning, prior studies have shown the promising potential of image-to-LiDAR distillation. These prior arts focus on the designs of their own losses to effectively distill the pre-trained 2D image representations into a 3D model. However, the other parts of the designs have been surprisingly unexplored. We find that fundamental design elements, e.g., the LiDAR coordinate system, quantization according to the existing input interface, and data utilization, are more critical than developing loss functions, which have been overlooked in prior works. In this work, we show that simple fixes to these designs notably outperform existing methods by 16% in 3D semantic segmentation on the nuScenes dataset and 13% in 3D object detection on the KITTI dataset in downstream task performance. We focus on overlooked design choices along the spatial and temporal axes. Spatially, prior work has used cylindrical coordinate and voxel sizes without considering their side effects yielded with a commonly deployed sparse convolution layer input interface, leading to spatial quantization errors in 3D models. Temporally, existing work has avoided cumbersome data curation by discarding unsynced data, limiting the use to only the small portion of data that is temporally synced across sensors. We analyze these effects and propose simple solutions for each overlooked aspect.</p></details> | Accepted to ACCV2024 | None |

Traditionally, 3D object detection methods are trained in a fully-supervised setup, requiring vast amounts of human annotations, which are laborious, costly, and do not scale well with the ever-increasing amounts of data being captured. In this paper, we present the first method to train 3D object detectors for monocular RGB cameras without domain-specific human annotations, thus making orders of magnitude more data available for training. Thanks to newly proposed Canonical Object Space, the method can not only exploit data across a variety of datasets and camera setups to train a single 3D detector, but unlike previous work it also works out of the box in previously unseen camera setups. All this is crucial for practical applications, where the data and cameras are extremely heterogeneous. The method is evaluated on two standard autonomous driving datasets, where it outperforms previous works, which, unlike our method, still rely on 2D human annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving real-time object detection on edge devices presents significant challenges due to their limited computational resources and the high demands of deep neural network (DNN)-based detection models, particularly when processing high-resolution video. Conventional strategies, such as input down-sampling and network up-scaling, often compromise detection accuracy for faster performance or lead to higher inference latency. To address these issues, this paper introduces RE-POSE, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-Driven Partitioning and Edge Offloading framework designed to optimize the accuracy-latency trade-off in resource-constrained edge environments. Our approach features an RL-Based Dynamic Clustering Algorithm (RL-DCA) that partitions video frames into non-uniform blocks based on object distribution and the computational characteristics of DNNs. Furthermore, a parallel edge offloading scheme is implemented to distribute these blocks across multiple edge servers for concurrent processing. Experimental evaluations show that RE-POSE significantly enhances detection accuracy and reduces inference latency, surpassing existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

The presence of numerous players and frequent occlusions, combined with copyright restrictions, severely restricts the availability of datasets, leaving limited options such as SoccerNet-Tracking and SportsMOT. These datasets suffer from a lack of diversity, which hinders algorithms from adapting effectively to varied soccer video contexts. To address these challenges, we developed SoccerSynth-Detection, the first synthetic dataset designed for the detection of synthetic soccer players. It includes a broad range of random lighting and textures, as well as simulated camera motion blur. We validated its efficacy using the object detection model (Yolov8n) against real-world datasets (SoccerNet-Tracking and SportsMoT). In transfer tests, it matched the performance of real datasets and significantly outperformed them in images with motion blur; in pre-training tests, it demonstrated its efficacy as a pre-training dataset, significantly enhancing the algorithm's overall performance.

The inherent visual complexity of camouflaged objects, including their low contrast with the background, diverse textures, and subtle appearance variations, often obscures semantic cues, making accurate segmentation highly challenging. Existing methods primarily rely on visual features, which are insufficient to handle the variability and intricacy of camouflaged objects, leading to unstable object perception and ambiguous segmentation results. To tackle these limitations, we introduce a novel task, class-guided camouflaged object detection (CGCOD), which extends traditional COD task by incorporating object-specific class knowledge to enhance detection robustness and accuracy. To facilitate this task, we present a new dataset, CamoClass, comprising real-world camouflaged objects with class annotations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage framework, CGNet, which incorporates a plug-and-play class prompt generator and a simple yet effective class-guided detector. This establishes a new paradigm for COD, bridging the gap between contextual understanding and class-guided detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our flexible framework in improving the performance of proposed and existing detectors by leveraging class-level textual information.</p></details> |  | None |

It starts as a polyp in the inner lining of the colon. To prevent CRC, early polyp detection is required. Colonosopy is used for the inspection of the colon. Generally, the images taken by the camera placed at the tip of the endoscope are analyzed by the experts manually. Various traditional machine learning models have been used with the rise of machine learning. Recently, deep learning models have shown more effectiveness in polyp detection due to their superiority in generalizing and learning small features. These deep learning models for object detection can be segregated into two different types: single-stage and two-stage. Generally, two stage models have higher accuracy than single stage ones but the single stage models have low inference time. Hence, single stage models are easy to use for quick object detection. YOLO is one of the singlestage models used successfully for polyp detection. It has drawn the attention of researchers because of its lower inference time. The researchers have used Different versions of YOLO so far, and with each newer version, the accuracy of the model is increasing. This paper aims to see the effectiveness of the recently released YOLOv11 to detect polyp. We analyzed the performance for all five models of YOLOv11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l, YOLO11x) with Kvasir dataset for the training and testing. Two different versions of the dataset were used. The first consisted of the original dataset, and the other was created using augmentation techniques.

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Sparsely Annotated Multispectral Pedestrian Detection (SAMPD). For limitation (i), we introduce Multispectral Pedestrian-aware Adaptive Weight (MPAW) and Positive Pseudo-label Enhancement (PPE) module. Utilizing multispectral knowledge, these modules ensure the generation of high-quality pseudo-labels and enable effective learning by increasing weights for high-quality pseudo-labels based on modality characteristics. To address limitation (ii), we propose an Adaptive Pedestrian Retrieval Augmentation (APRA) module, which adaptively incorporates pedestrian patches from ground-truth and dynamically integrates high-quality pseudo-labels with the ground-truth, facilitating a more diverse learning pool of pedestrians.

However, applying off-the-shelf detectors to a new domain leads to significant performance drop, caused by the domain gap. These detectors exhibit higher-variance class-conditional distributions in the target domain than that in the source domain, along with mean shift. To address this problem, we propose the Prototype Augmented Compact Features (PACF) framework to regularize the distribution of intra-class features. Specifically, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis on the lower bound of the target features-related likelihood and derive the prototype cross entropy loss to further calibrate the distribution of target RoI features. Furthermore, a mutual regularization strategy is designed to enable the linear and prototype-based classifiers to learn from each other, promoting feature compactness while enhancing discriminability. Thanks to this PACF framework, we have obtained a more compact cross-domain feature space, within which the variance of the target features' class-conditional distributions has significantly decreased, and the class-mean shift between the two domains has also been further reduced. The results on different adaptation settings are state-of-the-art, which demonstrate the board applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces an approach to estimate the performance of deep learning-based object detection models for quantifying defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, focusing on detecting irradiation-induced cavities in TEM images of metal alloys. We developed a random forest regression model that predicts the object detection F1 score, a statistical metric used to evaluate the ability to accurately locate and classify objects of interest. The random forest model uses features extracted from the predictions of the object detection model whose uncertainty is being quantified, enabling fast prediction on new, unlabeled images. The mean absolute error (MAE) for predicting F1 of the trained model on test data is 0.09, and the $R^2$ score is 0.77, indicating there is a significant correlation between the random forest regression model predicted and true defect detection F1 scores. The approach is shown to be robust across three distinct TEM image datasets with varying imaging and material domains. Our approach enables users to estimate the reliability of a defect detection and segmentation model predictions and assess the applicability of the model to their specific datasets, providing valuable information about possible domain shifts and whether the model needs to be fine-tuned or trained on additional data to be maximally effective for the desired use case.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

It assumes uniform and strict rotational equivariance across all features as the transformations under the specific group. However, the presentation or distribution of real-world data rarely conforms to strict rotational equivariance, commonly referred to as Rotational Symmetry-Breaking (RSB) in the system or dataset, making GConv unable to adapt effectively to this phenomenon. Motivated by this, we propose a simple but highly effective method to address this problem, which utilizes a set of learnable biases called $G$-Biases under the group order to break strict group constraints and then achieve a Relaxed Rotational Equivariant Convolution (RREConv). To validate the efficiency of RREConv, we conduct extensive ablation experiments on the discrete rotational group $\mathcal{C}_n$. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed RREConv-based methods achieve excellent performance compared to existing GConv-based methods in both classification and 2D object detection tasks on the natural image datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Feedback-driven object detection and iterative model improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19835v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated object detection has become increasingly valuable across diverse applications, yet efficient, high-quality annotation remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a platform designed to interactively improve object detection models. The platform allows uploading and annotating images as well as fine-tuning object detection models. Users can then manually review and refine annotations, further creating improved snapshots that are used for automatic object detection on subsequent image uploads - a process we refer to as semi-automatic annotation resulting in a significant gain in annotation efficiency. Whereas iterative refinement of model results to speed up annotation has become common practice, we are the first to quantitatively evaluate its benefits with respect to time, effort, and interaction savings. Our experimental results show clear evidence for a significant time reduction of up to 53% for semi-automatic compared to manual annotation. Importantly, these efficiency gains did not compromise annotation quality, while matching or occasionally even exceeding the accuracy of manual annotations. These findings demonstrate the potential of our lightweight annotation platform for creating high-quality object detection datasets and provide best practices to guide future development of annotation platforms. The platform is open-source, with the frontend and backend repositories available on GitHub (https://github.com/ml-lab-htw/iterative-annotate). To support the understanding of our labeling process, we have created an explanatory video demonstrating the methodology using microscopy images of E. coli bacteria as an example. The video is available on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM9uhE8NN5E).</p></details> | AI4EA24 | [Code Link](https://github.com/ml-lab-htw/iterative-annotate) |
| **[Bootstrapping Corner Cases: High-Resolution Inpainting for Safety Critical Detect and Avoid for Automated Flying](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08142v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern machine learning techniques have shown tremendous potential, especially for object detection on camera images. For this reason, they are also used to enable safety-critical automated processes such as autonomous drone flights. We present a study on object detection for Detect and Avoid, a safety critical function for drones that detects air traffic during automated flights for safety reasons. An ill-posed problem is the generation of good and especially large data sets, since detection itself is the corner case. Most models suffer from limited ground truth in raw data, \eg recorded air traffic or frontal flight with a small aircraft. It often leads to poor and critical detection rates. We overcome this problem by using inpainting methods to bootstrap the dataset such that it explicitly contains the corner cases of the raw data. We provide an overview of inpainting methods and generative models and present an example pipeline given a small annotated dataset. We validate our method by generating a high-resolution dataset, which we make publicly available and present it to an independent object detector that was fully trained on real data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Motion and Temporal Cues for Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07806v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the challenges in unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) by proposing an efficient algorithm, termed MTNet, which concurrently exploits motion and temporal cues. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on integrating appearance with motion or on modeling temporal relations, our method combines both aspects by integrating them within a unified framework. MTNet is devised by effectively merging appearance and motion features during the feature extraction process within encoders, promoting a more complementary representation. To capture the intricate long-range contextual dynamics and information embedded within videos, a temporal transformer module is introduced, facilitating efficacious inter-frame interactions throughout a video clip. Furthermore, we employ a cascade of decoders all feature levels across all feature levels to optimally exploit the derived features, aiming to generate increasingly precise segmentation masks. As a result, MTNet provides a strong and compact framework that explores both temporal and cross-modality knowledge to robustly localize and track the primary object accurately in various challenging scenarios efficiently. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks conclusively show that our method not only attains state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised video object segmentation but also delivers competitive results in video salient object detection. These findings highlight the method's robust versatility and its adeptness in adapting to a range of segmentation tasks.

| **[Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks for Visual Perception and Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07783v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image pyramids are widely adopted in top-performing methods to obtain multi-scale features for precise visual perception and understanding. However, current image pyramids use the same large-scale model to process multiple resolutions of images, leading to significant computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture, called Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP). Specifically, PIIP uses pretrained models (ViTs or CNNs) as branches to process multi-scale images, where images of higher resolutions are processed by smaller network branches to balance computational cost and performance. To integrate information from different spatial scales, we further propose a novel cross-branch feature interaction mechanism. To validate PIIP, we apply it to various perception models and a representative multimodal large language model called LLaVA, and conduct extensive experiments on various tasks such as object detection, segmentation, image classification and multimodal understanding. PIIP achieves superior performance compared to single-branch and existing multi-resolution approaches with lower computational cost. When applied to InternViT-6B, a large-scale vision foundation model, PIIP can improve its performance by 1%-2% on detection and segmentation with only 40%-60% of the original computation, finally achieving 60.0 box AP on MS COCO and 59.7 mIoU on ADE20K. For multimodal understanding, our PIIP-LLaVA achieves 73.0% accuracy on TextVQA and 74.5% on MMBench with only 2.8M training data.

| **[SST-EM: Advanced Metrics for Evaluating Semantic, Spatial and Temporal Aspects in Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07554v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video editing models have advanced significantly, but evaluating their performance remains challenging. Traditional metrics, such as CLIP text and image scores, often fall short: text scores are limited by inadequate training data and hierarchical dependencies, while image scores fail to assess temporal consistency. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation Metric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM comprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2) primary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement via an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with weights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis. The name SST-EM reflects its focus on Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal aspects of video evaluation. SST-EM provides a comprehensive evaluation of semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness in video editing.

| **[ML Mule: Mobile-Driven Context-Aware Collaborative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07536v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has been integrated into nearly every aspect of daily life, powering applications from object detection with computer vision to large language models for writing emails and compact models in smart homes. These machine learning models cater to individual users but are often detached from them, as they are typically stored and processed in centralized data centers. This centralized approach raises privacy concerns, incurs high infrastructure costs, and struggles with personalization. Federated and fully decentralized learning methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they still depend on centralized servers or face slow convergence due to communication constraints. To overcome these challenges, we propose ML Mule, a approach that utilizes individual mobile devices as 'Mules' to train and transport model snapshots as they move through physical spaces, sharing these models with the physical 'Spaces' they inhabit. This method implicitly forms affinity groups among devices associated with users who share particular spaces, enabling collaborative model evolution, and protecting users' privacy. Our approach addresses several major shortcomings of traditional, federated, and fully decentralized learning systems. The proposed framework represents a new class of machine learning methods that are more robust, distributed, and personalized, bringing the field closer to realizing the original vision of intelligent, adaptive, and genuinely context-aware smart environments. The results show that ML Mule converges faster and achieves higher model accuracy compared to other existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TimberVision: A Multi-Task Dataset and Framework for Log-Component Segmentation and Tracking in Autonomous Forestry Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07360v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timber represents an increasingly valuable and versatile resource. However, forestry operations such as harvesting, handling and measuring logs still require substantial human labor in remote environments posing significant safety risks. Progressively automating these tasks has the potential of increasing their efficiency as well as safety, but requires an accurate detection of individual logs as well as live trees and their context. Although initial approaches have been proposed for this challenging application domain, specialized data and algorithms are still too scarce to develop robust solutions. To mitigate this gap, we introduce the TimberVision dataset, consisting of more than 2k annotated RGB images containing a total of 51k trunk components including cut and lateral surfaces, thereby surpassing any existing dataset in this domain in terms of both quantity and detail by a large margin. Based on this data, we conduct a series of ablation experiments for oriented object detection and instance segmentation and evaluate the influence of multiple scene parameters on model performance. We introduce a generic framework to fuse the components detected by our models for both tasks into unified trunk representations. Furthermore, we automatically derive geometric properties and apply multi-object tracking to further enhance robustness. Our detection and tracking approach provides highly descriptive and accurate trunk representations solely from RGB image data, even under challenging environmental conditions. Our solution is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios and can be readily combined with other sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025.

| **[SCC-YOLO: An Improved Object Detector for Assisting in Brain Tumor Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03836v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain tumors can result in neurological dysfunction, alterations in cognitive and psychological states, increased intracranial pressure, and the occurrence of seizures, thereby presenting a substantial risk to human life and health. The You Only Look Once(YOLO) series models have demonstrated superior accuracy in object detection for medical imaging. In this paper, we develop a novel SCC-YOLO architecture by integrating the SCConv attention mechanism into YOLOv9. The SCConv module reconstructs an efficient convolutional module by reducing spatial and channel redundancy among features, thereby enhancing the learning of image features. We investigate the impact of intergrating different attention mechanisms with the YOLOv9 model on brain tumor image detection using both the Br35H dataset and our self-made dataset(Brain_Tumor_Dataset). Experimental results show that on the Br35H dataset, SCC-YOLO achieved a 0.3% improvement in mAp50 compared to YOLOv9, while on our self-made dataset, SCC-YOLO exhibited a 0.5% improvement over YOLOv9. SCC-YOLO has reached state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor detection.

| **[Toward Realistic Camouflaged Object Detection: Benchmarks and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07297v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged object detection (COD) primarily relies on semantic or instance segmentation methods. While these methods have made significant advancements in identifying the contours of camouflaged objects, they may be inefficient or cost-effective for tasks that only require the specific location of the object. Object detection algorithms offer an optimized solution for Realistic Camouflaged Object Detection (RCOD) in such cases. However, detecting camouflaged objects remains a formidable challenge due to the high degree of similarity between the features of the objects and their backgrounds. Unlike segmentation methods that perform pixel-wise comparisons to differentiate between foreground and background, object detectors omit this analysis, further aggravating the challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a camouflage-aware feature refinement (CAFR) strategy. Since camouflaged objects are not rare categories, CAFR fully utilizes a clear perception of the current object within the prior knowledge of large models to assist detectors in deeply understanding the distinctions between background and foreground. Specifically, in CAFR, we introduce the Adaptive Gradient Propagation (AGP) module that fine-tunes all feature extractor layers in large detection models to fully refine class-specific features from camouflaged contexts. We then design the Sparse Feature Refinement (SFR) module that optimizes the transformer-based feature extractor to focus primarily on capturing class-specific features in camouflaged scenarios. To facilitate the assessment of RCOD tasks, we manually annotate the labels required for detection on three existing segmentation COD datasets, creating a new benchmark for RCOD tasks.

| **[Dual Scale-aware Adaptive Masked Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07101v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent feature masking knowledge distillation methods make use of attention mechanisms to identify either important spatial regions or channel clues for discriminative feature reconstruction. However, most of existing strategies perform global attention-guided feature masking distillation without delving into fine-grained visual clues in feature maps. In particular, uncovering locality-aware clues across different scales are conducive to reconstructing region-aware features, thereby significantly benefiting distillation performance. In this study, we propose a fine-grained adaptive feature masking distillation framework for accurate object detection. Different from previous methods in which global masking is performed on single-scale feature maps, we explore the scale-aware feature masking by performing feature distillation across various scales, such that the object-aware locality is encoded for improved feature reconstruction. In addition, our fine-grained feature distillation strategy is combined with a masking logits distillation scheme in which logits difference between teacher and student networks is utilized to guide the distillation process. Thus, it can help the student model to better learn from the teacher counterpart with improved knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments for detection task demonstrate the superiority of our method. For example, when RetinaNet, RepPoints and Cascade Mask RCNN are used as teacher detectors, the student network achieves mAP scores of 41.5\%, 42.9\%, and 42.6\%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as DMKD and FreeKD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[On the Robustness of Object Detection Models on Aerial Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15378v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of object detection models is a major concern when applied to real-world scenarios. The performance of most models tends to degrade when confronted with images affected by corruptions, since they are usually trained and evaluated on clean datasets. While numerous studies have explored the robustness of object detection models on natural images, there is a paucity of research focused on models applied to aerial images, which feature complex backgrounds, substantial variations in scales, and orientations of objects. This paper addresses the challenge of assessing the robustness of object detection models on aerial images, with a specific emphasis on scenarios where images are affected by clouds. In this study, we introduce two novel benchmarks based on DOTA-v1.0. The first benchmark encompasses 19 prevalent corruptions, while the second focuses on the cloud-corrupted condition-a phenomenon uncommon in natural images yet frequent in aerial photography. We systematically evaluate the robustness of mainstream object detection models and perform necessary ablation experiments. Through our investigations, we find that rotation-invariant modeling and enhanced backbone architectures can improve the robustness of models. Furthermore, increasing the capacity of Transformer-based backbones can strengthen their robustness. The benchmarks we propose and our comprehensive experimental analyses can facilitate research on robust object detection on aerial images.

While the YOLO family has achieved great success in large target detection, its performance is less than satisfactory when faced with small targets. Because of this, this paper proposes a revolutionary model SL-YOLO (Stronger and Lighter YOLO) that aims to break the bottleneck of small target detection. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network (HEPAN), a pioneering cross-scale feature fusion method that can ensure unparalleled detection accuracy even in the most challenging environments. At the same time, without sacrificing detection capabilities, we design the C2fDCB lightweight module and add the SCDown downsampling module to greatly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity. Our experimental results on the VisDrone2019 dataset reveal a significant improvement in performance, with mAP@0.5 jumping from 43.0% to 46.9% and mAP@0.5:0.95 increasing from 26.0% to 28.9%. At the same time, the model parameters are reduced from 11.1M to 9.6M, and the FPS can reach 132, making it an ideal solution for real-time small object detection in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods overlook two important conflicts: point-pixel misalignment and sub-task suppression. The former means a pixel feature from the opaque object is projected to multiple point features of the same ray in the world space, and the latter means the classification prediction and bounding box regression may cause mutual suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Conflict Resolution Network (CoreNet) to address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we first propose a dual-stream transformation module to tackle point-pixel misalignment. It consists of ray-based and point-based 2D-to-BEV transformations. Both of them achieve approximately unique mapping from the image space to the world space. Moreover, we introduce a task-specific predictor to tackle sub-task suppression. It uses the dual-branch structure which adopts class-specific query and Bbox-specific query to corresponding sub-tasks. Each task-specific query is constructed of task-specific feature and general feature, which allows the heads to adaptively select information of interest based on different sub-tasks. Experiments on the large-scale nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CoreNet, by achieving 75.6\% NDS and 73.3\% mAP on the nuScenes test set without test-time augmentation and model ensemble techniques. The ample ablation study also demonstrates the effectiveness of each component.

However, these methods often struggle with the lack of accurate depth estimation caused by the natural weakness of the camera in ranging. Recently, multi-modal fusion and knowledge distillation methods for 3D object detection have been proposed to solve this problem, which are time-consuming during the training phase and not friendly to memory cost. In light of this, we propose PromptDet, a lightweight yet effective 3D object detection framework motivated by the success of prompt learning in 2D foundation model. Our proposed framework, PromptDet, comprises two integral components: a general camera-based detection module, exemplified by models like BEVDet and BEVDepth, and a LiDAR-assisted prompter. The LiDAR-assisted prompter leverages the LiDAR points as a complementary signal, enriched with a minimal set of additional trainable parameters. Notably, our framework is flexible due to our prompt-like design, which can not only be used as a lightweight multi-modal fusion method but also as a camera-only method for 3D object detection during the inference phase. Extensive experiments on nuScenes validate the effectiveness of the proposed PromptDet. As a multi-modal detector, PromptDet improves the mAP and NDS by at most 22.8\% and 21.1\% with fewer than 2\% extra parameters compared with the camera-only baseline. Without LiDAR points, PromptDet still achieves an improvement of at most 2.4\% mAP and 4.0\% NDS with almost no impact on camera detection inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

A great number of network designs follow the pure UNet and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture which has limited feature extraction and aggregation ability which motivated us to design a lightweight post-decoder refinement module, the crossed post-decoder refinement (CPDR) to enhance the feature representation of a standard FPN or U-Net framework. Specifically, we introduce the Attention Down Sample Fusion (ADF), which employs channel attention mechanisms with attention maps generated by high-level representation to refine the low-level features, and Attention Up Sample Fusion (AUF), leveraging the low-level information to guide the high-level features through spatial attention. Additionally, we proposed the Dual Attention Cross Fusion (DACF) upon ADFs and AUFs, which reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the performance. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |
