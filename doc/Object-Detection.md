| **[Fractal Calibration for long-tailed object detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11774v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world datasets follow an imbalanced distribution, which poses significant challenges in rare-category object detection. Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages. We provide the code at https://github.com/kostas1515/FRACAL.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/kostas1515/FRACAL) |
| **[DualDiff+: Dual-Branch Diffusion for High-Fidelity Video Generation with Reward Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03689v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and high-fidelity driving scene reconstruction demands the effective utilization of comprehensive scene information as conditional inputs. Existing methods predominantly rely on 3D bounding boxes and BEV road maps for foreground and background control, which fail to capture the full complexity of driving scenes and adequately integrate multimodal information. In this work, we present DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance driving scene generation across multiple views and video sequences. Specifically, we introduce Occupancy Ray-shape Sampling (ORS) as a conditional input, offering rich foreground and background semantics alongside 3D spatial geometry to precisely control the generation of both elements. To improve the synthesis of fine-grained foreground objects, particularly complex and distant ones, we propose a Foreground-Aware Mask (FGM) denoising loss function. Additionally, we develop the Semantic Fusion Attention (SFA) mechanism to dynamically prioritize relevant information and suppress noise, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Finally, to ensure high-quality image-to-video generation, we introduce the Reward-Guided Diffusion (RGD) framework, which maintains global consistency and semantic coherence in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualDiff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets. On the NuScenes dataset, DualDiff reduces the FID score by 4.09% compared to the best baseline. In downstream tasks, such as BEV segmentation, our method improves vehicle mIoU by 4.50% and road mIoU by 1.70%, while in BEV 3D object detection, the foreground mAP increases by 1.46%.

| **[4D Radar Ground Truth Augmentation with LiDAR-to-4D Radar Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03637v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground truth augmentation (GT-Aug) is a common method for LiDAR-based object detection, as it enhances object density by leveraging ground truth bounding boxes (GT bboxes). However, directly applying GT-Aug to 4D Radar tensor data overlooks important measurements outside the GT bboxes-such as sidelobes-leading to synthetic distributions that deviate from real-world 4D Radar data. To address this limitation, we propose 4D Radar Ground Truth Augmentation (4DR GT-Aug). Our approach first augments LiDAR data and then converts it to 4D Radar data via a LiDAR-to-4D Radar data synthesis (L2RDaS) module, which explicitly accounts for measurements both inside and outside GT bboxes. In doing so, it produces 4D Radar data distributions that more closely resemble real-world measurements, thereby improving object detection accuracy. Experiments on the K-Radar dataset show that the proposed method achieves improved performance compared to conventional GT-Aug in object detection for 4D Radar. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/kaist-avelab/K-Radar.</p></details> | 24 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/kaist-avelab/K-Radar) |
| **[Human-in-the-loop Reasoning For Traffic Sign Detection: Collaborative Approach Yolo With Video-llava](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05096v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) detection is a crucial component of autonomous vehicles. While You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm, factors like training data quality and adverse weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain) can lead to detection failures. These failures can be particularly dangerous when visual similarities between objects exist, such as mistaking a 30 km/h sign for a higher speed limit sign. This paper proposes a method that combines video analysis and reasoning, prompting with a human-in-the-loop guide large vision model to improve YOLOs accuracy in detecting road speed limit signs, especially in semi-real-world conditions. It is hypothesized that the guided prompting and reasoning abilities of Video-LLava can enhance YOLOs traffic sign detection capabilities. This hypothesis is supported by an evaluation based on human-annotated accuracy metrics within a dataset of recorded videos from the CARLA car simulator. The results demonstrate that a collaborative approach combining YOLO with Video-LLava and reasoning can effectively address challenging situations such as heavy rain and overcast conditions that hinder YOLOs detection capabilities.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Tiny Robotics Dataset and Benchmark for Continual Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16215v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting objects in mobile robotics is crucial for numerous applications, from autonomous navigation to inspection. However, robots often need to operate in different domains from those they were trained in, requiring them to adjust to these changes. Tiny mobile robots, subject to size, power, and computational constraints, encounter even more difficulties in running and adapting these algorithms. Such adaptability, though, is crucial for real-world deployment, where robots must operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable settings. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark to evaluate the continual learning capabilities of object detection systems in tiny robotic platforms. Our contributions include: (i) Tiny Robotics Object Detection~(TiROD), a comprehensive dataset collected using the onboard camera of a small mobile robot, designed to test object detectors across various domains and classes; (ii) a benchmark of different continual learning strategies on this dataset using NanoDet, a lightweight object detector. Our results highlight key challenges in developing robust and efficient continual learning strategies for object detectors in tiny robotics.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a methodology examining the adaptability and performance evaluation of the 3D object detection methods on a LiDAR point cloud dataset generated by simulating a SOTIF-related Use Case. The major contributions of this paper include defining and modelling a SOTIF-related Use Case with 21 diverse weather conditions and generating a LiDAR point cloud dataset suitable for application of 3D object detection methods. The dataset consists of 547 frames, encompassing clear, cloudy, rainy weather conditions, corresponding to different times of the day, including noon, sunset, and night. Employing MMDetection3D and OpenPCDET toolkits, the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) 3D object detection methods is evaluated and compared by testing the pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models on the generated dataset using Average Precision (AP) and Recall metrics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AI-Driven Multi-Stage Computer Vision System for Defect Detection in Laser-Engraved Industrial Nameplates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03395v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated defect detection in industrial manufacturing is essential for maintaining product quality and minimizing production errors. In air disc brake manufacturing, ensuring the precision of laser-engraved nameplates is crucial for accurate product identification and quality control. Engraving errors, such as misprints or missing characters, can compromise both aesthetics and functionality, leading to material waste and production delays. This paper presents a proof of concept for an AI-driven computer vision system that inspects and verifies laser-engraved nameplates, detecting defects in logos and alphanumeric strings. The system integrates object detection using YOLOv7, optical character recognition (OCR) with Tesseract, and anomaly detection through a residual variational autoencoder (ResVAE) along with other computer vision methods to enable comprehensive inspections at multiple stages. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness, achieving 91.33% accuracy and 100% recall, ensuring that defective nameplates are consistently detected and addressed. This solution highlights the potential of AI-driven visual inspection to enhance quality control, reduce manual inspection efforts, and improve overall manufacturing efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MIAdapt: Source-free Few-shot Domain Adaptive Object Detection for Microscopic Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03370v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing generic unsupervised domain adaptation approaches require access to both a large labeled source dataset and a sufficient unlabeled target dataset during adaptation. However, collecting a large dataset, even if unlabeled, is a challenging and expensive endeavor, especially in medical imaging. In addition, constraints such as privacy issues can result in cases where source data is unavailable. Taking in consideration these challenges, we propose MIAdapt, an adaptive approach for Microscopic Imagery Adaptation as a solution for Source-free Few-shot Domain Adaptive Object detection (SF-FSDA). We also define two competitive baselines (1) Faster-FreeShot and (2) MT-FreeShot. Extensive experiments on the challenging M5-Malaria and Raabin-WBC datasets validate the effectiveness of MIAdapt. Without using any image from the source domain MIAdapt surpasses state-of-the-art source-free UDA (SF-UDA) methods by +21.3% mAP and few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) approaches by +4.7% mAP on Raabin-WBC. Our code and models will be publicly available.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[Inference-Scale Complexity in ANN-SNN Conversion for High-Performance and Low-Power Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03368v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising substitute for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their advantages of fast inference and low power consumption. However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has hindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods necessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the conversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale complexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing algorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and fine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We also introduce an effective delayed evaluation strategy to mitigate the influence of the spike propagation delays. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework in typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and video classification. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. Moreover, we have evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating their superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. This approach simplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN models, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance reduction.

| **[BEVMOSNet: Multimodal Fusion for BEV Moving Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03280v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion understanding of the dynamic objects within the scene in bird's-eye-view (BEV) is critical to ensure a reliable obstacle avoidance system and smooth path planning for autonomous vehicles. However, this task has received relatively limited exploration when compared to object detection and segmentation with only a few recent vision-based approaches presenting preliminary findings that significantly deteriorate in low-light, nighttime, and adverse weather conditions such as rain. Conversely, LiDAR and radar sensors remain almost unaffected in these scenarios, and radar provides key velocity information of the objects. Therefore, we introduce BEVMOSNet, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end multimodal fusion leveraging cameras, LiDAR, and radar to precisely predict the moving objects in BEV. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis to find out the optimal strategy for deformable cross-attention-guided sensor fusion for cross-sensor knowledge sharing in BEV. While evaluating BEVMOSNet on the nuScenes dataset, we show an overall improvement in IoU score of 36.59% compared to the vision-based unimodal baseline BEV-MoSeg (Sigatapu et al., 2023), and 2.35% compared to the multimodel SimpleBEV (Harley et al., 2022), extended for the motion segmentation task, establishing this method as the state-of-the-art in BEV motion segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 20th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications (2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Scale-Invariant Object Detection by Adaptive Convolution with Unified Global-Local Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05274v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense features are important for detecting minute objects in images. Unfortunately, despite the remarkable efficacy of the CNN models in multi-scale object detection, CNN models often fail to detect smaller objects in images due to the loss of dense features during the pooling process. Atrous convolution addresses this issue by applying sparse kernels. However, sparse kernels often can lose the multi-scale detection efficacy of the CNN model. In this paper, we propose an object detection model using a Switchable (adaptive) Atrous Convolutional Network (SAC-Net) based on the efficientDet model. A fixed atrous rate limits the performance of the CNN models in the convolutional layers. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a switchable mechanism that allows for dynamically adjusting the atrous rate during the forward pass. The proposed SAC-Net encapsulates the benefits of both low-level and high-level features to achieve improved performance on multi-scale object detection tasks, without losing the dense features. Further, we apply a depth-wise switchable atrous rate to the proposed network, to improve the scale-invariant features. Finally, we apply global context on the proposed model. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAC-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LCV2I: Communication-Efficient and High-Performance Collaborative Perception Framework with Low-Resolution LiDAR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17039v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) collaborative perception leverages data collected by infrastructure's sensors to enhance vehicle perceptual capabilities. LiDAR, as a commonly used sensor in cooperative perception, is widely equipped in intelligent vehicles and infrastructure. However, its superior performance comes with a correspondingly high cost. To achieve low-cost V2I, reducing the cost of LiDAR is crucial. Therefore, we study adopting low-resolution LiDAR on the vehicle to minimize cost as much as possible. However, simply reducing the resolution of vehicle's LiDAR results in sparse point clouds, making distant small objects even more blurred. Additionally, traditional communication methods have relatively low bandwidth utilization efficiency. These factors pose challenges for us. To balance cost and perceptual accuracy, we propose a new collaborative perception framework, namely LCV2I. LCV2I uses data collected from cameras and low-resolution LiDAR as input. It also employs feature offset correction modules and regional feature enhancement algorithms to improve feature representation. Finally, we use regional difference map and regional score map to assess the value of collaboration content, thereby improving communication bandwidth efficiency. In summary, our approach achieves high perceptual performance while substantially reducing the demand for high-resolution sensors on the vehicle. To evaluate this algorithm, we conduct 3D object detection in the real-world scenario of DAIR-V2X, demonstrating that the performance of LCV2I consistently surpasses currently existing algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Class-Aware PillarMix: Can Mixed Sample Data Augmentation Enhance 3D Object Detection with Radar Point Clouds?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02687v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the significant effort required for data collection and annotation in 3D perception tasks, mixed sample data augmentation (MSDA) has been widely studied to generate diverse training samples by mixing existing data. Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, submitted to 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[R2Det: Exploring Relaxed Rotation Equivariance in 2D object detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11760v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to explore underlying symmetry in data, improving performance. However, real-world scenarios often deviate from ideal symmetric systems caused by physical permutation, characterized by non-trivial actions of a symmetry group, resulting in asymmetries that affect the outputs, a phenomenon known as Symmetry Breaking. Traditional GConv-based methods are constrained by rigid operational rules within group space, assuming data remains strictly symmetry after limited group transformations. This limitation makes it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking and non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we mainly focus on a common scenario: Rotational Symmetry-Breaking. By relaxing strict group transformations within Strict Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{C}_n$, we redefine a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_n$ and introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant GConv (R2GConv) with only a minimal increase of $4n$ parameters compared to GConv. Based on R2GConv, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and develop a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Object Detector (R2Det) for 2D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed R2GConv in natural image classification, and R2Det achieves excellent performance in 2D object detection with improved generalization capabilities and robustness.

| **[Night-Voyager: Consistent and Efficient Nocturnal Vision-Aided State Estimation in Object Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20054v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous robotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Continual Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05650v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning (CL) aims to learn new data while remembering previously acquired knowledge. In contrast to CL for image classification, CL for Object Detection faces additional challenges such as the missing annotations problem. In this scenario, images from previous tasks may contain instances of unknown classes that could reappear as labeled in future tasks, leading to task interference in replay-based approaches. Consequently, most approaches in the literature have focused on distillation-based techniques, which are effective when there is a significant class overlap between tasks. In our work, we propose an alternative to distillation-based approaches with a novel approach called Replay Consolidation with Label Propagation for Object Detection (RCLPOD). RCLPOD enhances the replay memory by improving the quality of the stored samples through a technique that promotes class balance while also improving the quality of the ground truth associated with these samples through a technique called label propagation. RCLPOD outperforms existing techniques on well-established benchmarks such as VOC and COC. Moreover, our approach is developed to work with modern architectures like YOLOv8, making it suitable for dynamic, real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, where continuous learning and resource efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Model Quantization in GenAI-based Image Inpainting and Detection of Arable Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02420v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based weed control systems often suffer from limited training data diversity and constrained on-board computation, impacting their real-world performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a framework that leverages Stable Diffusion-based inpainting to augment training data progressively in 10% increments -- up to an additional 200%, thus enhancing both the volume and diversity of samples. Our approach is evaluated on two state-of-the-art object detection models, YOLO11(l) and RT-DETR(l), using the mAP50 metric to assess detection performance. We explore quantization strategies (FP16 and INT8) for both the generative inpainting and detection models to strike a balance between inference speed and accuracy. Deployment of the downstream models on the Jetson Orin Nano demonstrates the practical viability of our framework in resource-constrained environments, ultimately improving detection accuracy and computational efficiency in intelligent weed management systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust detection of overlapping bioacoustic sound events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02389v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for accurately detecting bioacoustic sound events that is robust to overlapping events, a common issue in domains such as ethology, ecology and conservation. While standard methods employ a frame-based, multi-label approach, we introduce an onset-based detection method which we name Voxaboxen. It takes inspiration from object detection methods in computer vision, but simultaneously takes advantage of recent advances in self-supervised audio encoders. For each time window, Voxaboxen predicts whether it contains the start of a vocalization and how long the vocalization is. It also does the same in reverse, predicting whether each window contains the end of a vocalization, and how long ago it started. The two resulting sets of bounding boxes are then fused using a graph-matching algorithm. We also release a new dataset designed to measure performance on detecting overlapping vocalizations. This consists of recordings of zebra finches annotated with temporally-strong labels and showing frequent overlaps. We test Voxaboxen on seven existing data sets and on our new data set. We compare Voxaboxen to natural baselines and existing sound event detection methods and demonstrate SotA results. Further experiments show that improvements are robust to frequent vocalization overlap.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[YOLO-PRO: Enhancing Instance-Specific Object Detection with Full-Channel Global Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02348v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the inherent limitations of conventional bottleneck structures (diminished instance discriminability due to overemphasis on batch statistics) and decoupled heads (computational redundancy) in object detection frameworks by proposing two novel modules: the Instance-Specific Bottleneck with full-channel global self-attention (ISB) and the Instance-Specific Asymmetric Decoupled Head (ISADH). The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

Traditionally, human inspection has been used for detection, a slow and labour-intensive process. Recent research has applied machine learning techniques to this problem, yet there remains a shortage of high-quality, publicly available datasets. This paper introduces a synthetic dataset featuring diverse backgrounds, interfering foreground objects, diverse leak locations, and precise segmentation ground truth. We propose a zero-shot method that combines background subtraction, zero-shot object detection, filtering, and segmentation to leverage this dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods based solely on background subtraction and zero-shot object detection with segmentation, reaching an IoU of 69\% overall. We also present an analysis of various prompt configurations and threshold settings to provide deeper insights into the performance of our method.

| **[SSNet: Saliency Prior and State Space Model-based Network for Salient Object Detection in RGB-D Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02270v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) in RGB-D images is an essential task in computer vision, enabling applications in scene understanding, robotics, and augmented reality. However, existing methods struggle to capture global dependency across modalities, lack comprehensive saliency priors from both RGB and depth data, and are ineffective in handling low-quality depth maps. To address these challenges, we propose SSNet, a saliency-prior and state space model (SSM)-based network for the RGB-D SOD task. Unlike existing convolution- or transformer-based approaches, SSNet introduces an SSM-based multi-modal multi-scale decoder module to efficiently capture both intra- and inter-modal global dependency with linear complexity. Specifically, we propose a cross-modal selective scan SSM (CM-S6) mechanism, which effectively captures global dependency between different modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency enhancement module (SEM) that integrates three saliency priors with deep features to refine feature representation and improve the localization of salient objects. To further address the issue of low-quality depth maps, we propose an adaptive contrast enhancement technique that dynamically refines depth maps, making them more suitable for the RGB-D SOD task. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Training-free Anomaly Event Detection via LLM-guided Symbolic Pattern Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly event detection plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. However, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised learning, which faces significant challenges: the requirement for extensive labeled training data and lack of interpretability in decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we present a training-free framework that integrates open-set object detection with symbolic regression, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient symbolic pattern discovery. The LLMs guide the symbolic reasoning process, establishing logical relationships between detected entities. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains, our framework demonstrates several key advantages: (1) achieving superior detection accuracy through direct reasoning without any training process; (2) providing highly interpretable logical expressions that are readily comprehensible to humans; and (3) requiring minimal annotation effort - approximately 1% of the data needed by traditional training-based methods.To facilitate comprehensive evaluation and future research, we introduce two datasets: a large-scale private dataset containing over 110,000 annotated images covering various anomaly scenarios including construction site safety violations, illegal fishing activities, and industrial hazards, along with a public benchmark dataset of 5,000 samples with detailed anomaly event annotations.

Existing voxel-based methods face significant challenges when fusing sparse voxel features with dense image features in a one-to-one manner, resulting in the loss of the advantages of images, including semantic and continuity information, leading to sub-optimal detection performance, especially at long distances. In this paper, we present VoxelNextFusion, a multi-modal 3D object detection framework specifically designed for voxel-based methods, which effectively bridges the gap between sparse point clouds and dense images. In particular, we propose a voxel-based image pipeline that involves projecting point clouds onto images to obtain both pixel- and patch-level features. These features are then fused using a self-attention to obtain a combined representation. Moreover, to address the issue of background features present in patches, we propose a feature importance module that effectively distinguishes between foreground and background features, thus minimizing the impact of the background features. Extensive experiments were conducted on the widely used KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection benchmarks. Notably, our VoxelNextFusion achieved around +3.20% in AP@0.7 improvement for car detection in hard level compared to the Voxel R-CNN baseline on the KITTI test dataset</p></details> |  | None |

Although Vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing and image understanding, their applications remain limited in professional domains due to insufficient domain expertise. This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompasses diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains. Through experiments on 16 mainstream VLMs, the effectiveness of the dataset has been fully verified.

As a result, a growing need for efficient compression methods optimized for machine vision, rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, several methods have been developed for image and video coding for machines. Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine analysis. In this paper, we extend the current rate-distortion theory for machines, providing insight into important design considerations of machine-vision codecs. We then utilize this newfound understanding to improve several methods for learnable image coding for machines. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several computer vision tasks such as classification, instance segmentation, and object detection.</p></details> |  | None |

This task remains challenging due to complex variations in real-world applications. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse scene generation, which inspires us to explore their potential for improving DG tasks. Instead of generating images, our method extracts multi-step intermediate features during the diffusion process to obtain domain-invariant features for generalized detection. Furthermore, we propose an efficient knowledge transfer framework that enables detectors to inherit the generalization capabilities of diffusion models through feature and object-level alignment, without increasing inference time. We conduct extensive experiments on six challenging DG benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements of 14.0% mAP over existing DG approaches across different domains and corruption types. Notably, our method even outperforms most domain adaptation methods without accessing any target domain data. Moreover, the diffusion-guided detectors show consistent improvements of 15.9% mAP on average compared to the baseline. Our work aims to present an effective approach for domain-generalized detection and provide potential insights for robust visual recognition in real-world scenarios.

While deep learning models show promise in recognizing and classifying homogenous materials, the current literature lacks research assessing their performance for mixed, contaminated material in commercial material recycling facility settings. Despite the increasing numbers of deep learning models and datasets generated in this area, the sub-domain of deep learning analysis of construction and demolition waste piles remains underexplored. To address this gap, recent deep learning algorithms and techniques were explored. This review examines the progression in datasets, sensors and the evolution from object detection towards real-time segmentation models. It also synthesizes research from the past five years on deep learning for construction and demolition waste management, highlighting recent advancements while acknowledging limitations that hinder widespread commercial adoption. The analysis underscores the critical requirement for diverse and high-fidelity datasets, advanced sensor technologies, and robust algorithmic frameworks to facilitate the effective integration of deep learning methodologies into construction and demolition waste management systems. This integration is envisioned to contribute significantly towards the advancement of a more sustainable and circular economic model.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent open-source work like DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward is one key direction in reproducing o1. While the R1-style model has demonstrated success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains remains under-explored. This work introduces Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT), which further extends the application areas of RFT on visual tasks. Specifically, Visual-RFT first uses Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multiple responses containing reasoning tokens and final answers for each input, and then uses our proposed visual perception verifiable reward functions to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We design different verifiable reward functions for different perception tasks, such as the Intersection over Union (IoU) reward for object detection. Experimental results on fine-grained image classification, few-shot object detection, reasoning grounding, as well as open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks show the competitive performance and advanced generalization ability of Visual-RFT compared with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). For example, Visual-RFT improves accuracy by $24.3\%$ over the baseline in one-shot fine-grained image classification with around 100 samples. In few-shot object detection, Visual-RFT also exceeds the baseline by $21.9$ on COCO's two-shot setting and $15.4$ on LVIS. Our Visual-RFT represents a paradigm shift in fine-tuning LVLMs, offering a data-efficient, reward-driven approach that enhances reasoning and adaptability for domain-specific tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://github.com/Liuziyu77/Visual-RFT</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Liuziyu77/Visual-RFT) |

However, various types of noise in sonar images can affect the accuracy of object detection. Denoising, as a critical preprocessing step, aims to remove noise while retaining useful information to improve detection accuracy. Although deep learning-based denoising algorithms perform well on optical images, their application to underwater sonar images remains underexplored. This paper systematically evaluates the effectiveness of several deep learning-based denoising algorithms, originally designed for optical images, in the context of underwater sonar image object detection. We apply nine trained denoising models to images from five open-source sonar datasets, each processing different types of noise. We then test the denoised images using four object detection algorithms. The results show that different denoising models have varying effects on detection performance. By combining the strengths of multiple denoising models, the detection results can be optimized, thus more effectively suppressing noise. Additionally, we adopt a multi-frame denoising technique, using different outputs generated by multiple denoising models as multiple frames of the same scene for further processing to enhance detection accuracy. This method, originally designed for optical images, leverages complementary noise-reduction effects. Experimental results show that denoised sonar images improve the performance of object detection algorithms compared to the original sonar images.</p></details> |  | None |

Investigating the adversarial robustness of embodied vision navigation is crucial, especially given the threat of 3D physical attacks that could pose risks to human safety. However, existing attack methods for embodied vision navigation often lack physical feasibility due to challenges in transferring digital perturbations into the physical world. Moreover, current physical attacks for object detection struggle to achieve both multi-view effectiveness and visual naturalness in navigation scenarios. To address this, we propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching adversarial patches to objects, where both opacity and textures are learnable. Specifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a multi-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which optimizes the patch's texture based on feedback from the vision-based perception model used in navigation. To make the patch inconspicuous to human observers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, in which opacity is fine-tuned after texture optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our adversarial patches decrease the navigation success rate by an average of 22.39%, outperforming previous methods in practicality, effectiveness, and naturalness.

Here we used a speculative prototyping approach to explore this expansive design space: First, we identified some potential challenges of interest, including crimes and illnesses that disproportionately affect women, as well as potential opportunities for designers, which were visualized in five sketches. Then, one of the sketched scenarios was further explored by developing a prototype, of a robotic helper drone equipped with computer vision to detect hidden cameras that could be used to spy on women. While object detection introduced some errors, hidden cameras were identified with a reasonable accuracy of 80% (Intersection over Union (IoU) score: 0.40). Our aim is that the identified challenges and opportunities could help spark discussion and inspire designers, toward realizing a safer, more inclusive future through responsible use of technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted Version of a Published Conference Paper in 14th Scandinavian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (SCAI 2024): AI for a better society, June 10-11, 2024, J\"onk\"oping, Sweden, Link\"oping Electronic Conference Proceedings (ECP) ISSN: 1650-3740 (CC BY 4.0 License)</p></details> | None |

This study focuses on developing an intelligent algorithm which can navigate a robot through a kitchen, recognizing objects, and tracking their relocation. The kitchen was chosen as the testing ground due to its dynamic nature as objects are frequently moved, rearranged and replaced. Various techniques, such as SLAM feature-based tracking and deep learning-based object detection (e.g., Faster R-CNN), are commonly used for object tracking. Additionally, methods such as optical flow analysis and 3D reconstruction have also been used to track the relocation of objects. These approaches often face challenges when it comes to problems such as lighting variations and partial occlusions, where parts of the object are hidden in some frames but visible in others. The proposed method in this study leverages the YOLOv5 architecture, initialized with pre-trained weights and subsequently fine-tuned on a custom dataset. A novel method was developed, introducing a frame-scoring algorithm which calculates a score for each object based on its location and features within all frames. This scoring approach helps to identify changes by determining the best-associated frame for each object and comparing the results in each scene, overcoming limitations seen in other methods while maintaining simplicity in design. The experimental results demonstrate an accuracy of 97.72%, a precision of 95.83% and a recall of 96.84% for this algorithm, which highlights the efficacy of the model in detecting spatial changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: 2024 14th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE) Publisher: IEEE</p></details> | None |

The cascaded decoder architecture constrains object queries to update in the cascaded direction, only enabling object queries to learn relatively-limited information from image features. However, the challenges for object detection in natural scenes (e.g., extremely-small, heavily-occluded, and confusingly mixed with the background) require an object detection model to fully utilize image features, which motivates us to propose a new decoder architecture with the parallel Multi-time Inquiries (MI) mechanism. MI enables object queries to learn more comprehensive information, and our MI based model, MI-DETR, outperforms all existing DETR-like models on COCO benchmark under different backbones and training epochs, achieving +2.3 AP and +0.6 AP improvements compared to the most representative model DINO and SOTA model Relation-DETR under ResNet-50 backbone.

Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce HiBug2, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. HiBug2 first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, HiBug2 extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that HiBug2 not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception.

This paper introduces ClipGrader, a novel approach that leverages vision-language models to automatically assess the accuracy of bounding box annotations. By adapting CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) to evaluate both class label correctness and spatial precision of bounding box, ClipGrader offers an effective solution for grading object detection labels. Tested on modified object detection datasets with artificially disturbed bounding boxes, ClipGrader achieves 91% accuracy on COCO with a 1.8% false positive rate. Moreover, it maintains 87% accuracy with a 2.1% false positive rate when trained on just 10% of the COCO data. ClipGrader also scales effectively to larger datasets such as LVIS, achieving 79% accuracy across 1,203 classes. Our experiments demonstrate ClipGrader's ability to identify errors in existing COCO annotations, highlighting its potential for dataset refinement. When integrated into a semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) model, ClipGrader readily improves the pseudo label quality, helping achieve higher mAP (mean Average Precision) throughout the training process. ClipGrader thus provides a scalable AI-assisted tool for enhancing annotation quality control and verifying annotations in large-scale object detection datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging the complementary capabilities of LiDAR and camera sensors, ICanC improves detection accuracy under conditions where camera performance typically declines, while significantly reducing unnecessary headlight usage. This approach aligns with the broader objective of promoting sustainable transportation. ICanC comprises three primary nodes: the Obstacle Detector, which processes LiDAR point cloud data to fit bounding boxes onto detected objects and estimate their position, velocity, and orientation; the Danger Detector, which evaluates potential threats using the information provided by the Obstacle Detector; and the Light Controller, which dynamically activates headlights to enhance camera visibility solely when a threat is detected. Experiments conducted in physical and simulated environments demonstrate ICanC's robust performance, even in the presence of significant noise interference. The system consistently achieves high accuracy in camera-based object detection when headlights are engaged, while significantly reducing overall headlight energy consumption. These results position ICanC as a promising advancement in autonomous vehicle research, achieving a balance between energy efficiency and reliable object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 18 figures, to be published in IEEE MOST 2025</p></details> | None |

Moreo-ver, the trade-off between model accuracy and computational complexity poses additional constraints on the application of RSOD algorithms. To address these issues, this study proposes an efficient and lightweight RSOD algorithm integrat-ing multi-scale receptive fields and foreground focus mechanism, named RFWNet.

Additionally, we developed a Foreground Background Separation Module (FBSM) consisting of a background redundant information filtering module and a foreground information enhancement module to emphasize critical regions within images while filtering redundant background information. Finally, we designed a loss function, the Weighted CIoU-Wasserstein (WCW) loss, which weights the IoU-based loss by using the Normalized Wasserstein Distance to mitigate model sensitivity to small object position deviations. Experimental evaluations on the DOTA V1.0 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets demonstrate that RFWNet achieves advanced perfor-mance with 6.0M parameters and can achieves 52 FPS.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper shows that large strip convolutions are good feature representation learners for remote sensing object detection and can detect objects of various aspect ratios well. Based on large strip convolutions, we build a new network architecture called Strip R-CNN, which is simple, efficient, and powerful. Unlike recent remote sensing object detectors that leverage large-kernel convolutions with square shapes, our Strip R-CNN takes advantage of sequential orthogonal large strip convolutions in our backbone network StripNet to capture spatial information. In addition, we improve the localization capability of remote-sensing object detectors by decoupling the detection heads and equipping the localization branch with strip convolutions in our strip head. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks, for example DOTA, FAIR1M, HRSC2016, and DIOR, show that our Strip R-CNN can greatly improve previous work. In particular, our 30M model achieves 82.75% mAP on DOTA-v1.0, setting a new state-of-the-art record.

However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weatherrobust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset.

| **[Modulating CNN Features with Pre-Trained ViT Representations for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16981v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to large-scale image-text contrastive training, pre-trained vision language model (VLM) like CLIP shows superior open-vocabulary recognition ability. Most existing open-vocabulary object detectors attempt to utilize the pre-trained VLMs to attain generalized representation. F-ViT uses the pre-trained visual encoder as the backbone network and freezes it during training. However, its frozen backbone doesn't benefit from the labeled data to strengthen the representation for detection. Therefore, we propose a novel two-branch backbone network, named as \textbf{V}iT-Feature-\textbf{M}odulated Multi-Scale \textbf{C}onvolutional Network (VMCNet), which consists of a trainable convolutional branch, a frozen pre-trained ViT branch and a VMC module. The trainable CNN branch could be optimized with labeled data while the frozen pre-trained ViT branch could keep the representation ability derived from large-scale pre-training. Then, the proposed VMC module could modulate the multi-scale CNN features with the representations from ViT branch. With this proposed mixed structure, the detector is more likely to discover objects of novel categories. Evaluated on two popular benchmarks, our method boosts the detection performance on novel category and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On OV-COCO, the proposed method achieves 44.3 AP$_{50}^{\mathrm{novel}}$ with ViT-B/16 and 48.5 AP$_{50}^{\mathrm{novel}}$ with ViT-L/14. On OV-LVIS, VMCNet with ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/14 reaches 27.8 and 38.4 mAP$_{r}$.</p></details> |  | None |

These attacks have a varied level of potency and can be implemented in both white box and black box approaches. Practical attacks include methods to manipulate the physical world and enforce adversarial behaviour by the corresponding target neural network models. Multiple different approaches to mitigate different kinds of such attacks are available in the literature, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive systematization of knowledge on adversarial defenses, focusing on two key computer vision tasks: image classification and object detection. We review the state-of-the-art adversarial defense techniques and categorize them for easier comparison. In addition, we provide a schematic representation of these categories within the context of the overall machine learning pipeline, facilitating clearer understanding and benchmarking of defenses. Furthermore, we map these defenses to the types of adversarial attacks and datasets where they are most effective, offering practical insights for researchers and practitioners. This study is necessary for understanding the scope of how the available defenses are able to address the adversarial threats, and their shortcomings as well, which is necessary for driving the research in this area in the most appropriate direction, with the aim of building trustworthy AI systems for regular practical use-cases.</p></details> |  | None |

Chest X-rays are a standard method for TB screening, yet many countries face a critical shortage of radiologists capable of interpreting these images. Machine learning offers an alternative, as it can automate tasks such as disease diagnosis, and report generation. However, traditional approaches rely on task-specific models, which cannot utilize the interdependence between tasks. Building a multi-task model capable of performing multiple tasks poses additional challenges such as scarcity of multimodal data, dataset imbalance, and negative transfer. To address these challenges, we propose PaliGemma-CXR, a multi-task multimodal model capable of performing TB diagnosis, object detection, segmentation, report generation, and VQA. Starting with a dataset of chest X-ray images annotated with TB diagnosis labels and segmentation masks, we curated a multimodal dataset to support additional tasks. By finetuning PaliGemma on this dataset and sampling data using ratios of the inverse of the size of task datasets, we achieved the following results across all tasks: 90.32% accuracy on TB diagnosis and 98.95% on close-ended VQA, 41.3 BLEU score on report generation, and a mAP of 19.4 and 16.0 on object detection and segmentation, respectively. These results demonstrate that PaliGemma-CXR effectively leverages the interdependence between multiple image interpretation tasks to enhance performance.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Multimodal Search on a Line](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07000v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the diverse set of technologies used in underground object detection and imaging, we introduce a novel multimodal linear search problem whereby a single searcher starts at the origin and must find a target that can only be detected when the searcher moves through its location using the correct of $p$ possible search modes. The target's location, its distance $d$ from the origin, and the correct search mode are all initially unknown to the searcher. We prove tight upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio for this problem. Specifically, we show that when $p$ is odd, the optimal competitive ratio is given by $2p+3+\sqrt{8(p+1)}$, whereas when $p$ is even, the optimal competitive ratio is given by $c$: the unique solution to $(c-1)^4-4p(c+1)^2(c-p-1)=0$ in the interval $\left[2p+1+\sqrt{8p},\infty\right)$. This solution $c$ has the explicit bounds $2p+3+\sqrt{8(p-1)}\leq c\leq 2p+3+\sqrt{8p}$. The optimal algorithms we propose require the searcher to move infinitesimal distances and change directions infinitely many times within finite intervals. To better suit practical applications, we also propose an approximation algorithm with a competitive ratio of $c+\varepsilon$ (where $c$ is the optimal competitive ratio and $\varepsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant). This algorithm involves the searcher moving finite distances and changing directions a finite number of times within any finite interval.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FASTer: Focal Token Acquiring-and-Scaling Transformer for Long-term 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01899v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent top-performing temporal 3D detectors based on Lidars have increasingly adopted region-based paradigms. They first generate coarse proposals, followed by encoding and fusing regional features. However, indiscriminate sampling and fusion often overlook the varying contributions of individual points and lead to exponentially increased complexity as the number of input frames grows. Moreover, arbitrary result-level concatenation limits the global information extraction. In this paper, we propose a Focal Token Acquring-and-Scaling Transformer (FASTer), which dynamically selects focal tokens and condenses token sequences in an adaptive and lightweight manner. Emphasizing the contribution of individual tokens, we propose a simple but effective Adaptive Scaling mechanism to capture geometric contexts while sifting out focal points. Adaptively storing and processing only focal points in historical frames dramatically reduces the overall complexity. Furthermore, a novel Grouped Hierarchical Fusion strategy is proposed, progressively performing sequence scaling and Intra-Group Fusion operations to facilitate the exchange of global spatial and temporal information. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our FASTer significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors in both performance and efficiency while also exhibiting improved flexibility and robustness.

COU contains approximately 10K segmented images, annotated from images collected during a number of underwater robot field trials in diverse locations. COU has been created to address the lack of datasets with robust class coverage curated for underwater instance segmentation, which is particularly useful for training light-weight, real-time capable detectors for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). In addition, COU addresses the lack of diversity in object classes since the commonly available underwater image datasets focus only on marine life. Currently, COU contains images from both closed-water (pool) and open-water (lakes and oceans) environments, of 24 different classes of objects including marine debris, dive tools, and AUVs. To assess the efficacy of COU in training underwater object detectors, we use three state-of-the-art models to evaluate its performance and accuracy, using a combination of standard accuracy and efficiency metrics. The improved performance of COU-trained detectors over those solely trained on terrestrial data demonstrates the clear advantage of training with annotated underwater images.

| **[RTGen: Real-Time Generative Detection Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20622v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While open-vocabulary object detectors require predefined categories during inference, generative object detectors overcome this limitation by endowing the model with text generation capabilities. However, existing generative object detection methods directly append an autoregressive language model to an object detector to generate texts for each detected object. This straightforward design leads to structural redundancy and increased processing time. In this paper, we propose a Real-Time GENerative Detection Transformer (RTGen), a real-time generative object detector with a succinct encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we introduce a novel Region-Language Decoder (RL-Decoder), which innovatively integrates a non-autoregressive language model into the detection decoder, enabling concurrent processing of object and text information. With these efficient designs, RTGen achieves a remarkable inference speed of 60.41 FPS. Moreover, RTGen obtains 18.6 mAP on the LVIS dataset, outperforming the previous SOTA method by 3.5 mAP.</p></details> |  | None |

Although sophisticated 3D object detection and tracking methods have been investigated and developed thoroughly in the fields of computer vision and autonomous driving, their demands on expensive and high-accuracy sensor setups and substantial computational resources from large neural networks make them unsuitable for indoor robotics. Recently, more lightweight perception algorithms leveraging onboard cameras or LiDAR sensors have emerged as promising alternatives. However, relying on a single sensor poses significant limitations: cameras have limited fields of view and can suffer from high noise, whereas LiDAR sensors operate at lower frequencies and lack the richness of visual features. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic obstacle detection and tracking framework that uses both onboard camera and LiDAR data to enable lightweight and accurate perception. Our proposed method expands on our previous ensemble detection approach, which integrates outputs from multiple low-accuracy but computationally efficient detectors to ensure real-time performance on the onboard computer. In this work, we propose a more robust fusion strategy that integrates both LiDAR and visual data to enhance detection accuracy further. We then utilize a tracking module that adopts feature-based object association and the Kalman filter to track and estimate detected obstacles' states. Besides, a dynamic obstacle classification algorithm is designed to robustly identify moving objects. The dataset evaluation demonstrates a better perception performance compared to benchmark methods. The physical experiments on a quadcopter robot confirms the feasibility for real-world navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

However, point clouds from LiDARs used in automated driving are particularly challenging for MAEs since large areas of the 3D volume are empty. Consequently, existing work suffers from leaking occupancy information into the decoder and has significant computational complexity, thereby limiting the SSL pre-training to only 2D bird's eye view encoders in practice. In this work, we propose the novel neighborhood occupancy MAE (NOMAE) that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by employing masked occupancy reconstruction only in the neighborhood of non-masked voxels. We incorporate voxel masking and occupancy reconstruction at multiple scales with our proposed hierarchical mask generation technique to capture features of objects of different sizes in the point cloud. NOMAEs are extremely flexible and can be directly employed for SSL in existing 3D architectures. We perform extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets for the downstream perception tasks of semantic segmentation and 3D object detection, comparing with both discriminative and generative SSL methods. The results demonstrate that NOMAE sets the new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks for multiple point cloud perception tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, recent studies also reveal that with proper architecture design, convolutional networks (ConvNets) also achieve competitive performance with transformers. However, no prior methods have explored to utilize pure convolution to build a Transformer-style Decoder module, which is essential for Encoder-Decoder architecture like Detection Transformer (DETR). To this end, in this paper we explore whether we could build query-based detection and segmentation framework with ConvNets instead of sophisticated transformer architecture. We propose a novel mechanism dubbed InterConv to perform interaction between object queries and image features via convolutional layers. Equipped with the proposed InterConv, we build Detection ConvNet (DECO), which is composed of a backbone and convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. We compare the proposed DECO against prior detectors on the challenging COCO benchmark. Despite its simplicity, our DECO achieves competitive performance in terms of detection accuracy and running speed. Specifically, with the ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 backbone, our DECO achieves $40.5\%$ and $47.8\%$ AP with $66$ and $34$ FPS, respectively. The proposed method is also evaluated on the segment anything task, demonstrating similar performance and higher efficiency. We hope the proposed method brings another perspective for designing architectures for vision tasks.

However, recent efforts in ConvNet designs primarily focused on increasing kernel size to obtain a larger receptive field without considering this crucial biomimetic mechanism to further improve performance. To this end, we propose a novel pure ConvNet vision backbone, termed OverLoCK, which is carefully devised from both the architecture and mixer perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a biomimetic Deep-stage Decomposition Strategy (DDS) that fuses semantically meaningful context representations into middle and deep layers by providing dynamic top-down context guidance at both feature and kernel weight levels. To fully unleash the power of top-down context guidance, we further propose a novel \textbf{Cont}ext-\textbf{Mix}ing Dynamic Convolution (ContMix) that effectively models long-range dependencies while preserving inherent local inductive biases even when the input resolution increases. These properties are absent in previous convolutions. With the support from both DDS and ContMix, our OverLoCK exhibits notable performance improvement over existing methods. For instance, OverLoCK-T achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 84.2\%, significantly surpassing ConvNeXt-B while only using around one-third of the FLOPs/parameters. On object detection with Cascade Mask R-CNN, our OverLoCK-S surpasses MogaNet-B by a significant 1\% in AP$^b$. On semantic segmentation with UperNet, our OverLoCK-T remarkably improves UniRepLKNet-T by 1.7\% in mIoU.

While these methods have demonstrated impressive results on standard benchmarks, the robustness of such approaches in the face of complex real-world environments requires additional verification. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of collaborative perception methods in the presence of natural corruptions typical of real-world environments. Furthermore, we propose DSRC, a robustness-enhanced collaborative perception method aiming to learn Density-insensitive and Semantic-aware collaborative Representation against Corruptions. DSRC consists of two key designs: i) a semantic-guided sparse-to-dense distillation framework, which constructs multi-view dense objects painted by ground truth bounding boxes to effectively learn density-insensitive and semantic-aware collaborative representation; ii) a feature-to-point cloud reconstruction approach to better fuse critical collaborative representation across agents. To thoroughly evaluate DSRC, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTA collaborative perception methods in both clean and corrupted conditions.

However, two critical mismatches: low-latency Events \textit{vs.}~high-latency RGB frames; temporally sparse labels in training \textit{vs.}~continuous flow in inference, significantly hinder the high-frequency fusion-based object detection. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{F}requency-\textbf{A}daptive Low-Latency \textbf{O}bject \textbf{D}etector (FAOD). FAOD aligns low-frequency RGB frames with high-frequency Events through an Align Module, which reinforces cross-modal style and spatial proximity to address the Event-RGB Mismatch. We further propose a training strategy, Time Shift, which enforces the module to align the prediction from temporally shifted Event-RGB pairs and their original representation, that is, consistent with Event-aligned annotations. This strategy enables the network to use high-frequency Event data as the primary reference while treating low-frequency RGB images as supplementary information, retaining the low-latency nature of the Event stream toward high-frequency detection. Furthermore, we observe that these corrected Event-RGB pairs demonstrate better generalization from low training frequency to higher inference frequencies compared to using Event data alone. Extensive experiments on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD and DSEC-Detection datasets demonstrate that our FAOD achieves SOTA performance. Specifically, in the PKU-DAVIS-SOD Dataset, FAOD achieves 9.8 points improvement in terms of the mAP in fully paired Event-RGB data with only a quarter of the parameters compared to SODFormer, and even maintains robust performance (only a 3 points drop in mAP) under 80$\times$ Event-RGB frequency mismatch.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite their empirical success, the underlying mechanisms of MAEs remain insufficiently understood. Recent studies have attempted to elucidate the functioning of MAEs through contrastive learning and feature representation analysis, yet these approaches often provide only implicit insights. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for understanding MAEs by leveraging the information bottleneck principle in information theory. Our theoretical analyses reveal that optimizing the latent features to balance relevant and irrelevant information is key to improving MAE performance. Building upon our proofs, we introduce MI-MAE, a novel method that optimizes MAEs through mutual information maximization and minimization. By enhancing latent features to retain maximal relevant information between them and the output, and minimizing irrelevant information between them and the input, our approach achieves better performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that MI-MAE significantly outperforms MAE models in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Our findings validate the theoretical framework and highlight the practical advantages of applying the information bottleneck principle to MAEs, offering deeper insights for developing more powerful self-supervised learning models.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

However, depth ambiguity poses a significant challenge, as it requires extracting precise 3D scene geometry from a single image, resulting in suboptimal performance when transferring knowledge from a LiDAR-based teacher model to a camera-based student model. To address this issue, we introduce {\em Monocular Teaching Assistant Knowledge Distillation (MonoTAKD)} to enhance 3D perception in Mono3D. Our approach presents a robust camera-based teaching assistant model that effectively bridges the representation gap between different modalities for teacher and student models, addressing the challenge of inaccurate depth estimation.

Despite recent advancements in BEV generation, inherent noise, stemming from sensor limitations and the learning process, remains largely unaddressed, resulting in suboptimal BEV representations that adversely impact the performance of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose BEVDiffuser, a novel diffusion model that effectively denoises BEV feature maps using the ground-truth object layout as guidance. BEVDiffuser can be operated in a plug-and-play manner during training time to enhance existing BEV models without requiring any architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate BEVDiffuser's exceptional denoising and generation capabilities, which enable significant enhancement to existing BEV models, as evidenced by notable improvements of 12.3\% in mAP and 10.1\% in NDS achieved for 3D object detection without introducing additional computational complexity. Moreover, substantial improvements in long-tail object detection and under challenging weather and lighting conditions further validate BEVDiffuser's effectiveness in denoising and enhancing BEV representations.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 | None |

Recently, advanced multi-modal methods incorporating camera information have achieved notable performance. For a safe and effective autonomous driving system, algorithms that excel not only in accuracy but also in speed and low latency are essential. However, existing algorithms fail to meet these requirements due to the latency and bandwidth limitations of fixed frame rate sensors, e.g., LiDAR and camera. To address this limitation, we introduce asynchronous event cameras into 3D object detection for the first time. We leverage their high temporal resolution and low bandwidth to enable high-speed 3D object detection. Our method enables detection even during inter-frame intervals when synchronized data is unavailable, by retrieving previous 3D information through the event camera. Furthermore, we introduce the first event-based 3D object detection dataset, DSEC-3DOD, which includes ground-truth 3D bounding boxes at 100 FPS, establishing the first benchmark for event-based 3D detectors.

While vision-language research has aimed to develop models with compositional understanding capabilities, this is not reflected yet in existing datasets which, for the most part, still use plain text to describe images. In this work, we propose a new annotation strategy, graph-based captioning (GBC) that describes an image using a labeled graph structure, with nodes of various types. The nodes in GBC are created through a two-stage process: first, identifying and describing entity nodes; second, linking these nodes by highlighting \textit{compositions} and \textit{relations} among them. Since \textit{all} GBC nodes hold plain text descriptions, GBC retains the flexibility found in natural language, but can also encode hierarchical information in its edges. We demonstrate that GBC can be produced automatically, using off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs and object detection models, by building a new dataset GBC10M that gathers GBC annotations for about 10M images of the CC12M dataset. Through CLIP training on GBC10M, we show that leveraging GBC nodes' annotations -- particularly those in composition and relation nodes -- significantly boosts the model's performance across various benchmarks compared to when other annotations are used. To further explore the opportunities provided by GBC, we also investigate the use of GBC as middleware for text-to-image generation, and show the extra benefits of incorporating the graph structure in this task.

Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire further research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient deployment on edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |

Although YOLOv12 is new in more accurate than YOLOv11, and YOLOv10, the YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO algorithm among YOLOv10, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12. These findings demonstrated that YOLOv12, when trained on high-quality LLM-generated datasets, not only surpassed its predecessors in key performance metrics but also offered a cost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data collection in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> | None |
| **[RadarDistill: Boosting Radar-based Object Detection Performance via Knowledge Distillation from LiDAR Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05061v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent noisy and sparse characteristics of radar data pose challenges in finding effective representations for 3D object detection. In this paper, we propose RadarDistill, a novel knowledge distillation (KD) method, which can improve the representation of radar data by leveraging LiDAR data. RadarDistill successfully transfers desirable characteristics of LiDAR features into radar features using three key components: Cross-Modality Alignment (CMA), Activation-based Feature Distillation (AFD), and Proposal-based Feature Distillation (PFD). CMA enhances the density of radar features by employing multiple layers of dilation operations, effectively addressing the challenge of inefficient knowledge transfer from LiDAR to radar. AFD selectively transfers knowledge based on regions of the LiDAR features, with a specific focus on areas where activation intensity exceeds a predefined threshold. PFD similarly guides the radar network to selectively mimic features from the LiDAR network within the object proposals. Our comparative analyses conducted on the nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RadarDistill achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for radar-only object detection task, recording 20.5% in mAP and 43.7% in NDS. Also, RadarDistill significantly improves the performance of the camera-radar fusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024.

However, PAFPN struggles to integrate high-level semantic cues with low-level spatial details, limiting its performance in real-world applications, especially with significant scale variations. In this paper, we propose MHAF-YOLO, a novel detection framework featuring a versatile neck design called the Multi-Branch Auxiliary FPN (MAFPN), which consists of two key modules: the Superficial Assisted Fusion (SAF) and Advanced Assisted Fusion (AAF). The SAF bridges the backbone and the neck by fusing shallow features, effectively transferring crucial low-level spatial information with high fidelity. Meanwhile, the AAF integrates multi-scale feature information at deeper neck layers, delivering richer gradient information to the output layer and further enhancing the model learning capacity. To complement MAFPN, we introduce the Global Heterogeneous Flexible Kernel Selection (GHFKS) mechanism and the Reparameterized Heterogeneous Multi-Scale (RepHMS) module to enhance feature fusion. RepHMS is globally integrated into the network, utilizing GHFKS to select larger convolutional kernels for various feature layers, expanding the vertical receptive field and capturing contextual information across spatial hierarchies. Locally, it optimizes convolution by processing both large and small kernels within the same layer, broadening the lateral receptive field and preserving crucial details for detecting smaller targets.

Existing open-vocabulary detectors are limited by complex visual-textual misalignment and long-tailed category imbalances, leading to suboptimal performance in challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce MQADet, a universal paradigm for enhancing existing open-vocabulary detectors by leveraging the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MQADet functions as a plug-and-play solution that integrates seamlessly with pre-trained object detectors without substantial additional training costs. Specifically, we design a novel three-stage Multimodal Question Answering (MQA) pipeline to guide the MLLMs to precisely localize complex textual and visual targets while effectively enhancing the focus of existing object detectors on relevant objects. To validate our approach, we present a new benchmark for evaluating our paradigm on four challenging open-vocabulary datasets, employing three state-of-the-art object detectors as baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed paradigm significantly improves the performance of existing detectors, particularly in unseen complex categories, across diverse and challenging scenarios. To facilitate future research, we will publicly release our code.</p></details> |  | None |

Vegetation encroachment is a significant threat to the safe operation of power lines, requiring reliable and timely management to enhance the resilience and reliability of the power network. Integrating smart grid technology, especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), provides substantial potential to revolutionize the management of extensive power line networks with advanced imaging techniques. However, processing the vast quantity of images captured by UAV patrols remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces an intelligent real-time monitoring framework for detecting power lines and adjacent vegetation. It is developed based on the deep-learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), You Only Look Once (YOLO), renowned for its high-speed object detection capabilities. Unlike existing deep learning-based methods, this framework enhances accuracy by integrating YOLOv8 with directional filters. They can extract directional features and textures of power lines and their vicinity, generating Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) for more precise localization. Additionally, a post-processing algorithm is developed to create a vegetation encroachment metric for power lines, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the surrounding vegetation distribution.

It represents the first comprehensive experimental evaluation of YOLOv3 to the latest version, YOLOv12, on various object detection challenges. The challenges considered include varying object sizes, diverse aspect ratios, and small-sized objects of a single class, ensuring a comprehensive assessment across datasets with distinct challenges. To ensure a robust evaluation, we employ a comprehensive set of metrics, including Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision (mAP), Processing Time, GFLOPs count, and Model Size. Our analysis highlights the distinctive strengths and limitations of each YOLO version. For example: YOLOv9 demonstrates substantial accuracy but struggles with detecting small objects and efficiency whereas YOLOv10 exhibits relatively lower accuracy due to architectural choices that affect its performance in overlapping object detection but excels in speed and efficiency. Additionally, the YOLO11 family consistently shows superior performance maintaining a remarkable balance of accuracy and efficiency. However, YOLOv12 delivered underwhelming results, with its complex architecture introducing computational overhead without significant performance gains. These results provide critical insights for both industry and academia, facilitating the selection of the most suitable YOLO algorithm for diverse applications and guiding future enhancements.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |
| **[Multi-Perspective Data Augmentation for Few-shot Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18195v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods have focused on augmenting synthetic samples for novel classes, show promising results to the rise of diffusion models. However, the diversity of such datasets is often limited in representativeness because they lack awareness of typical and hard samples, especially in the context of foreground and background relationships. To tackle this issue, we propose a Multi-Perspective Data Augmentation (MPAD) framework. In terms of foreground-foreground relationships, we propose in-context learning for object synthesis (ICOS) with bounding box adjustments to enhance the detail and spatial information of synthetic samples. Inspired by the large margin principle, support samples play a vital role in defining class boundaries. Therefore, we design a Harmonic Prompt Aggregation Scheduler (HPAS) to mix prompt embeddings at each time step of the generation process in diffusion models, producing hard novel samples. For foreground-background relationships, we introduce a Background Proposal method (BAP) to sample typical and hard backgrounds. Extensive experiments on multiple FSOD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving an average increase of $17.5\%$ in nAP50 over the baseline on PASCAL VOC.

However, the effectiveness of QV is impeded by the limited visual range of its hardware, resulting in suboptimal image quality for distant portions of the sewer network. Image super-resolution is an effective way to improve image quality and has been applied in a variety of scenes. However, research on super-resolution for sewer images remains considerably unexplored. In response, this study leverages the inherent depth relationships present within QV images and introduces a novel Depth-guided, Reference-based Super-Resolution framework denoted as DSRNet. It comprises two core components: a depth extraction module and a depth information matching module (DMM). DSRNet utilizes the adjacent frames of the low-resolution image as reference images and helps them recover texture information based on the correlation. By combining these modules, the integration of depth priors significantly enhances both visual quality and performance benchmarks. Besides, in pursuit of computational efficiency and compactness, a super-resolution knowledge distillation model based on an attention mechanism is introduced. This mechanism facilitates the acquisition of feature similarity between a more complex teacher model and a streamlined student model, with the latter being a lightweight version of DSRNet. Experimental results demonstrate that DSRNet significantly improves PSNR and SSIM compared with other methods. This study also conducts experiments on sewer defect semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification on the Pipe dataset and Sewer-ML dataset. Experiments show that the method can improve the performance of low-resolution sewer images in these tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional approaches rely on hard boundaries, which introduce uncertainty, whereas medical imaging demands flexible soft region recognition to handle irregular structures. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Progressive Local Alignment Network (PLAN), which designs a novel contrastive learning-based approach for local alignment to establish meaningful word-pixel relationships and introduces a progressive learning strategy to iteratively refine these relationships, enhancing alignment precision and robustness. By combining these techniques, PLAN effectively improves soft region recognition while suppressing noise interference. Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets demonstrate that PLAN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in phrase grounding, image-text retrieval, object detection, and zero-shot classification, setting a new benchmark for medical image-text alignment.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods, such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN, often struggle to cope with these complexities. As computer vision evolves, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transformer-based approaches offers promising opportunities for improving detection accuracy and efficiency. This study is the first to experiment with Detection Transformer (DETR) for automatic vehicle detection in complex and varied settings. We employ a Collaborative Hybrid Assignments Training scheme, Co-DETR, to enhance feature learning and attention mechanisms in DETR. By leveraging versatile label assignment strategies and introducing multiple parallel auxiliary heads, we provide more effective supervision during training and extract positive coordinates to boost training efficiency. Through extensive experiments on DETR variants and YOLO models, conducted using the BadODD dataset, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach. Our method achieves superior results, and improved accuracy in diverse conditions, making it practical for real-world deployment. This work significantly advances autonomous navigation technology and opens new research avenues in object detection for autonomous vehicles. By integrating the strengths of CNNs and Transformers, we highlight the potential of DETR for robust and efficient vehicle detection in challenging driving environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the labeled data adequate for model training is practically difficult to come by due to the time-consuming, labor-intensive process that requires specialized expertise to recognize plant species. This study introduces semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods for leveraging unlabeled data for enhanced weed detection and proposes a new YOLOv8-based SSOD method, i.e., WeedTeacher. An experimental comparison of four SSOD methods, including three existing frameworks (i.e., DenseTeacher, EfficientTeacher, and SmallTeacher) and WeedTeacher, alongside fully supervised baselines, was conducted for weed detection in both in-domain and cross-domain contexts. A new, diverse weed dataset was created as the testbed, comprising a total of 19,931 field images from two differing domains, including 8,435 labeled (basic-domain) images acquired by handholding devices from 2021 to 2023 and 11,496 unlabeled (new-domain) images acquired by a ground-based mobile platform in 2024. The in-domain experiment with models trained using 10% of the labeled, basic-domain images and tested on the remaining 90% of the data, showed that the YOLOv8-basedWeedTeacher achieved the highest accuracy among all four SSOD methods, with an improvement of 2.6% mAP@50 and 3.1% mAP@50:95 over its supervised baseline (i.e., YOLOv8l). In the cross-domain experiment where the unlabeled new-domain data was incorporated, all four SSOD methods, however, resulted in no or limited improvements over their supervised counterparts. Research is needed to address the difficulty of cross-domain data utilization for robust weed detection.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figure | None |

This is why introducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be of great help to enhance the efficiency of SAR missions while simultaneously increasing the safety of everyone involved in the mission. Motivated by this, we design and experiment with autonomous UAV search for humans in a Mediterranean karst environment. The UAVs are directed using Heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) ergodic control method according to known probability density and detection function. The implemented sensing framework consists of a probabilistic search model, motion control system, and computer vision object detection. It enables calculation of the probability of the target being detected in the SAR mission, and this paper focuses on experimental validation of proposed probabilistic framework and UAV control. The uniform probability density to ensure the even probability of finding the targets in the desired search area is achieved by assigning suitably thought-out tasks to 78 volunteers. The detection model is based on YOLO and trained with a previously collected ortho-photo image database. The experimental search is carefully planned and conducted, while as many parameters as possible are recorded. The thorough analysis consists of the motion control system, object detection, and the search validation. The assessment of the detection and search performance provides strong indication that the designed detection model in the UAV control algorithm is aligned with real-world results.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures | None |

Understanding and mitigating negative effects requires parsing data on forests at global scale from a broad array of sensory modalities, and using them in diverse forest monitoring applications. Such diversity in data and applications can be effectively addressed through the development of a large, pre-trained foundation model that serves as a versatile base for various downstream tasks. However, remote sensing modalities, which are an excellent fit for several forest management tasks, are particularly challenging considering the variation in environmental conditions, object scales, image acquisition modes, spatio-temporal resolutions, etc. With that in mind, we present the first unified Forest Monitoring Benchmark (FoMo-Bench), carefully constructed to evaluate foundation models with such flexibility. FoMo-Bench consists of 15 diverse datasets encompassing satellite, aerial, and inventory data, covering a variety of geographical regions, and including multispectral, red-green-blue, synthetic aperture radar and LiDAR data with various temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions. FoMo-Bench includes multiple types of forest-monitoring tasks, spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection. To enhance task and geographic diversity in FoMo-Bench, we introduce TalloS, a global dataset combining satellite imagery with ground-based annotations for tree species classification across 1,000+ categories and hierarchical taxonomic levels. Finally, we propose FoMo-Net, a pre-training framework to develop foundation models with the capacity to process any combination of commonly used modalities and spectral bands in remote sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AI for Social Impact track</p></details> | None |

However, there is a scarcity of labeled data in current RSIOD datasets, which significantly limits the performance of current detection algorithms. Although existing techniques, e.g., data augmentation and semi-supervised learning, can mitigate this scarcity issue to some extent, they are heavily dependent on high-quality labeled data and perform worse in rare object classes. To address this issue, this paper proposes a layout-controllable diffusion generative model (i.e. AeroGen) tailored for RSIOD. To our knowledge, AeroGen is the first model to simultaneously support horizontal and rotated bounding box condition generation, thus enabling the generation of high-quality synthetic images that meet specific layout and object category requirements. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation framework that integrates a diversity-conditioned generator and a filtering mechanism to enhance both the diversity and quality of generated data. Experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data produced by our method are of high quality and diversity. Furthermore, the synthetic RSIOD data can significantly improve the detection performance of existing RSIOD models, i.e., the mAP metrics on DIOR, DIOR-R, and HRSC datasets are improved by 3.7%, 4.3%, and 2.43%, respectively.

The primary goal is to transform high-resolution or high-dimensional data into an interpretable format to generate actionable insights, aiding decision-making and advancing knowledge. Currently, this task relies on complex, human-designed workflows comprising iterative steps such as denoising, spatial sampling, keypoint detection, feature generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolutions. The introduction of machine learning over the past decade has accelerated tasks like image segmentation and object detection via supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction via unsupervised methods. However, both classical and NN-based approaches still require human input, whether for hyperparameter tuning, data labeling, or both. The growing use of automated imaging tools, from atomically resolved imaging to biological applications, demands unsupervised methods that optimize data representation for human decision-making or autonomous experimentation. Here, we discuss advances in reward-based workflows, which adopt expert decision-making principles and demonstrate strong transfer learning across diverse tasks. We represent image analysis as a decision-making process over possible operations and identify desiderata and their mappings to classical decision-making frameworks. Reward-driven workflows enable a shift from supervised, black-box models sensitive to distribution shifts to explainable, unsupervised, and robust optimization in image analysis. They can function as wrappers over classical and DCNN-based methods, making them applicable to both unsupervised and supervised workflows (e.g., classification, regression for structure-property mapping) across imaging and hyperspectral data.</p></details> | 38 pages, 11 figures | None |

Since existing works do not fully utilize the geometry context of 3D objects, blurry boundaries are generated when segmenting objects with complex backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware 3D salient object detection network that explicitly clusters points into superpoints to enhance the geometric boundaries of objects, thereby segmenting complete objects with clear boundaries. Specifically, we first propose a simple yet effective superpoint partition module to cluster points into superpoints. In order to improve the quality of superpoints, we present a point cloud class-agnostic loss to learn discriminative point features for clustering superpoints from the object. After obtaining superpoints, we then propose a geometry enhancement module that utilizes superpoint-point attention to aggregate geometric information into point features for predicting the salient map of the object with clear boundaries.

The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics. Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques. The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation. The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task. Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system.</p></details> |  | None |

Its real-world adoption in surgical applications, however, remains limited. We review the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning (DL)-based CV models for segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures in videos obtained during surgical procedures. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of studies on semantic segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures published between 2014 and 2024 from 3 major databases - PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore. The primary objective was to evaluate the state-of-the-art performance of semantic segmentation in surgical videos. Secondary objectives included examining DL models, progress toward clinical applications, and the specific challenges with segmentation of organs/tissues in surgical videos. Results: We identified 58 relevant published studies. These focused predominantly on procedures from general surgery [20(34.4%)], colorectal surgery [9(15.5%)], and neurosurgery [8(13.8%)]. Cholecystectomy [14(24.1%)] and low anterior rectal resection [5(8.6%)] were the most common procedures addressed. Semantic segmentation [47(81%)] was the primary CV task. U-Net [14(24.1%)] and DeepLab [13(22.4%)] were the most widely used models. Larger organs such as the liver (Dice score: 0.88) had higher accuracy compared to smaller structures such as nerves (Dice score: 0.49). Models demonstrated real-time inference potential ranging from 5-298 frames-per-second (fps). Conclusion: This review highlights the significant progress made in DL-based semantic segmentation for surgical videos with real-time applicability, particularly for larger organs. Addressing challenges with smaller structures, data availability, and generalizability remains crucial for future advancements.</p></details> | 38 pages, 2 figures | None |

However, existing multi-modal object detection (MM-OD) methods degrade when facing significant domain-shift and are sample insufficient. We hypothesize that rich text information could more effectively help the model to build a knowledge relationship between the vision instance and its language description and can help mitigate domain shift. Specifically, we study the Cross-Domain few-shot generalization of MM-OD (CDMM-FSOD) and propose a meta-learning based multi-modal few-shot object detection method that utilizes rich text semantic information as an auxiliary modality to achieve domain adaptation in the context of FSOD. Our proposed network contains (i) a multi-modal feature aggregation module that aligns the vision and language support feature embeddings and (ii) a rich text semantic rectify module that utilizes bidirectional text feature generation to reinforce multi-modal feature alignment and thus to enhance the model's language understanding capability. We evaluate our model on common standard cross-domain object detection datasets and demonstrate that our approach considerably outperforms existing FSOD methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation with Reinforcement Learning for Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18510v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers diverse knowledge from a teacher pool to a student network. The core problem of multi-teacher KD is how to balance distillation strengths among various teachers. Most existing methods often develop weighting strategies from an individual perspective of teacher performance or teacher-student gaps, lacking comprehensive information for guidance. This paper proposes Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation with Reinforcement Learning (MTKD-RL) to optimize multi-teacher weights. In this framework, we construct both teacher performance and teacher-student gaps as state information to an agent. The agent outputs the teacher weight and can be updated by the return reward from the student. MTKD-RL reinforces the interaction between the student and teacher using an agent in an RL-based decision mechanism, achieving better matching capability with more meaningful weights. Experimental results on visual recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrate that MTKD-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the existing multi-teacher KD works.</p></details> | AAAI-2025 | None |

Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these approaches rely on 3D point clouds, which present challenges in encoding efficiency and neural network processing. With the advent of advanced LiDAR sensors like Ouster OS1, which, in addition to 3D point clouds, produce fixed resolution depth, signal, and ambient panoramic 2D images, new opportunities emerge for LiDAR based tasks. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to connect LiDAR data with text by leveraging 2D imagery generated by the OS1 sensor instead of 3D point clouds. Using the Florence 2 large model in a zero-shot setting, we perform image captioning and object detection. Our experiments demonstrate that Florence 2 generates more informative captions and achieves superior performance in object detection tasks compared to existing methods like CLIP. By combining advanced LiDAR sensor data with a large pre-trained model, our approach provides a robust and accurate solution for challenging detection scenarios, including real-time applications requiring high accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

To ensure accurate and reliable environmental perception, intelligent vehicles must exhibit accuracy and robustness in various environments. Millimeter-wave radar, known for its high penetration capability, can operate effectively in adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, and fog. Traditional 3D millimeter-wave radars can only provide range, Doppler, and azimuth information for objects. Although the recent emergence of 4D millimeter-wave radars has added elevation resolution, the radar point clouds remain sparse due to Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) operations. In contrast, cameras offer rich semantic details but are sensitive to lighting and weather conditions. Hence, this paper leverages these two highly complementary and cost-effective sensors, 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera. By integrating 4D radar spectra with depth-aware camera images and employing attention mechanisms, we fuse texture-rich images with depth-rich radar data in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective, enhancing 3D object detection. Additionally, we propose using GAN-based networks to generate depth images from radar spectra in the absence of depth sensors, further improving detection accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their quantization performance significantly degrades when INT8 inference is required, with a degradation of 58.2% in mAP and 36.9% in NDS on the NuScenes dataset. To address this issue, we propose a quantization-aware position embedding transformation for multi-view 3D object detection, termed Q-PETR. Q-PETR offers a quantizationfriendly and deployment-friendly architecture while preserving the original performance of PETR. It substantially narrows the accuracy gap between INT8 and FP32 inference for PETR-series methods. Without bells and whistles, our approach reduces the mAP and NDS drop to within 1% under standard 8-bit per-tensor post-training quantization. Furthermore, our method exceeds the performance of the original PETR in terms of floating-point precision.

This design is however fundamentally restricted due to overlooking the modality-specific strengths and finally hampering the model performance. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a novel modality interaction strategy that allows individual per-modality representations to be learned and maintained throughout, enabling their unique characteristics to be exploited during the whole perception pipeline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we design DeepInteraction++, a multi-modal interaction framework characterized by a multi-modal representational interaction encoder and a multi-modal predictive interaction decoder. Specifically, the encoder is implemented as a dual-stream Transformer with specialized attention operation for information exchange and integration between separate modality-specific representations. Our multi-modal representational learning incorporates both object-centric, precise sampling-based feature alignment and global dense information spreading, essential for the more challenging planning task. The decoder is designed to iteratively refine the predictions by alternately aggregating information from separate representations in a unified modality-agnostic manner, realizing multi-modal predictive interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework on both 3D object detection and end-to-end autonomous driving tasks.

Existing S-DGOD approaches often rely on data augmentation strategies, including a composition of visual transformations, to enhance the detector's generalization ability. However, the absence of real-world prior knowledge hinders data augmentation from contributing to the diversity of training data distributions. To address this issue, we propose PhysAug, a novel physical model-based non-ideal imaging condition data augmentation method, to enhance the adaptability of the S-DGOD tasks. Drawing upon the principles of atmospheric optics, we develop a universal perturbation model that serves as the foundation for our proposed PhysAug. Given that visual perturbations typically arise from the interaction of light with atmospheric particles, the image frequency spectrum is harnessed to simulate real-world variations during training. This approach fosters the detector to learn domain-invariant representations, thereby enhancing its ability to generalize across various settings. Without altering the network architecture or loss function, our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art across various S-DGOD datasets. In particular, it achieves a substantial improvement of $7.3\%$ and $7.2\%$ over the baseline on DWD and Cityscape-C, highlighting its enhanced generalizability in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI,2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods like YOLO11, while proficient in spatial feature extraction for precise detection, often struggle with these small and dynamically moving objects, particularly in handling real-time data updates and resource efficiency. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework that integrates dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) with YOLO11 to address these limitations. Unlike standard GNNs, DGNNs are chosen for their superior ability to dynamically update graph structures in real-time, which enables adaptive and robust tracking of objects in highly variable urban traffic scenarios. This framework constructs and regularly updates its graph representations, capturing objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thus effectively responding to rapidly changing conditions. Additionally, DGNN-YOLO incorporates Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques to enhance interpretability and foster trust, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, achieving a precision of 0.8382, recall of 0.6875, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.6476, significantly outperforming existing methods. This study offers a scalable and interpretable solution for real-time traffic surveillance and significantly advances intelligent transportation systems' capabilities by addressing the critical challenge of detecting and tracking small, occluded objects.</p></details> |  | None |

With multiple model variants, similar to its predecessors, YOLOv12 offers scalable solutions for both latency-sensitive and high-accuracy applications. Experimental results manifest consistent gains in mean average precision (mAP) and inference speed, making YOLOv12 a compelling choice for applications in autonomous systems, security, and real-time analytics.

The core design is based on a series of investigations on how multi-branch features of the basic block and convolutions with different kernel sizes affect the detection performance of objects at different scales. The outcome is a new strategy that can significantly enhance multi-scale feature representations of real-time object detectors. To verify the effectiveness of our work, we train our YOLO-MS on the MS COCO dataset from scratch without relying on any other large-scale datasets, like ImageNet or pre-trained weights. Without bells and whistles, our YOLO-MS outperforms the recent state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including YOLO-v7, RTMDet, and YOLO-v8. Taking the XS version of YOLO-MS as an example, it can achieve an AP score of 42+% on MS COCO, which is about 2% higher than RTMDet with the same model size. Furthermore, our work can also serve as a plug-and-play module for other YOLO models.

However, the depth prediction lacks accuracy and consistency, and the concatenation-based fusion in LXL impedes the model robustness. In this work, we propose LXLv2, where modifications are made to overcome the limitations and improve the performance. Specifically, considering the position error in radar measurements, we devise a one-to-many depth supervision strategy via radar points, where the radar cross section (RCS) value is further exploited to adjust the supervision area for object-level depth consistency. Additionally, a channel and spatial attention-based fusion module named CSAFusion is introduced to improve feature adaptiveness. Experimental results on the View-of-Delft and TJ4DRadSet datasets show that the proposed LXLv2 can outperform LXL in detection accuracy, inference speed and robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |

The approach is proposed for use on board of autonomous aerial vehicles equipped with a 3D LiDAR sensor. It relies on a novel 3D occupancy voxel mapping method for the target detection that provides high localization accuracy and robustness with respect to varying environments and appearance changes of the target. In combination with a proposed cluster-based multi-target tracker, sporadic false positives are suppressed, state estimation of the target is provided, and the detection latency is negligible. This makes the system suitable for tasks of agile multi-robot interaction, such as autonomous aerial interception or formation control where fast, precise, and robust relative localization of other robots is crucial.

However, they mainly focus on either visible or thermal modality, while visible-thermal (RGBT) bimodality is rarely explored. Although some RGBT datasets have been developed recently, the insufficient quantity, limited category, misaligned images and large target size cannot provide an impartial benchmark to evaluate multi-category visible-thermal small object detection (RGBT SOD) algorithms. In this paper, we build the first large-scale benchmark with high diversity for RGBT SOD (namely RGBT-Tiny), including 115 paired sequences, 93K frames and 1.2M manual annotations. RGBT-Tiny contains abundant targets (7 categories) and high-diversity scenes (8 types that cover different illumination and density variations). Note that, over 81% of targets are smaller than 16x16, and we provide paired bounding box annotations with tracking ID to offer an extremely challenging benchmark with wide-range applications, such as RGBT fusion, detection and tracking. In addition, we propose a scale adaptive fitness (SAFit) measure that exhibits high robustness on both small and large targets. The proposed SAFit can provide reasonable performance evaluation and promote detection performance. Based on the proposed RGBT-Tiny dataset and SAFit measure, extensive evaluations have been conducted, including 23 recent state-of-the-art algorithms that cover four different types (i.e., visible generic detection, visible SOD, thermal SOD and RGBT object detection).

Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive point cloud sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of point cloud sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we increase the number of point cloud sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as many as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception performance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves several 3D perception baseline methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Fusion of these modalities further enhances accuracy, but existing methods often introduce complexity or dataset-specific dependencies.

Our method verifies the higher-performing, yet overly optimistic LiDAR model detections using camera detections that are obtained from either specially trained, general, or open-vocabulary models. VaLID uses a lightweight neural verification network trained with a high recall bias to reduce the false predictions made by the LiDAR detector, while still preserving the true ones. Evaluating with multiple combinations of LiDAR and camera detectors on the KITTI dataset, we reduce false positives by an average of 63.9%, thus outperforming the individual detectors on 3D average precision (3DAP).

The dynamic properties of video enable detection of camouflaged objects through motion cues or varied perspectives. Previous VCOD datasets primarily contain animal objects, limiting the scope of research to wildlife scenarios. However, the applications of VCOD extend beyond wildlife and have significant implications in security, art, and medical fields. Addressing this problem, we construct a new large-scale multi-domain VCOD dataset MSVCOD. To achieve high-quality annotations, we design a semi-automatic iterative annotation pipeline that reduces costs while maintaining annotation accuracy. Our MSVCOD is the largest VCOD dataset to date, introducing multiple object categories including human, animal, medical, and vehicle objects for the first time, while also expanding background diversity across various environments. This expanded scope increases the practical applicability of the VCOD task in camouflaged object detection. Alongside this dataset, we introduce a one-steam video camouflage object detection model that performs both feature extraction and information fusion without additional motion feature fusion modules. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the existing VCOD animal dataset and the proposed MSVCOD. The dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

The framework takes two sets of predictions from different algorithms and associates their inconsistencies with the collision risk via fuzzy inference. The first set of predictions is obtained by retrieving safety-critical 2.5D objects from a depth map, and the second set comes from the ordinary AV's 3D object detector. We experimentally validate that, based on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and a depth discrepancy measure, the inconsistencies between the two sets of predictions strongly correlate to the error of the 3D object detector against ground truths. This correlation allows us to construct a fuzzy inference system and map the inconsistency measures to an AV collision risk indicator. In particular, we optimize the fuzzy inference system towards an existing offline metric that matches AV collision rates well. Lastly, we validate our monitor's capability to produce relevant risk estimates with the large-scale nuScenes dataset and demonstrate that it can safeguard an AV in closed-loop simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025, 7 pages (IEEE double column format), 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

Recent approaches rely on dynamic objects for learning to detect mobile objects but penalize the detections of static instances during training. Multiple rounds of self-training are used to add detected static instances to the set of training targets; this procedure to improve performance is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose the method UNION. We use spatial clustering and self-supervised scene flow to obtain a set of static and dynamic object proposals from LiDAR. Subsequently, object proposals' visual appearances are encoded to distinguish static objects in the foreground and background by selecting static instances that are visually similar to dynamic objects. As a result, static and dynamic mobile objects are obtained together, and existing detectors can be trained with a single training. In addition, we extend 3D object discovery to detection by using object appearance-based cluster labels as pseudo-class labels for training object classification.

As such, significant differences between training and test distributions often lead to degradations in performance. We introduce Multiple Distribution Shift -- Aerial (MDS-A) -- a collection of inter-related datasets of the same aerial domain that are perturbed in different ways to better characterize the effects of out-of-distribution performance. Specifically, MDS-A is a set of simulated aerial datasets collected under different weather conditions. We include six datasets under different simulated weather conditions along with six baseline object-detection models, as well as several test datasets that are a mix of weather conditions that we show have significant differences from the training data. In this paper, we present characterizations of MDS-A, provide performance results for the baseline machine learning models (on both their specific training datasets and the test data), as well as results of the baselines after employing recent knowledge-engineering error-detection techniques (EDR) thought to improve out-of-distribution performance.

Poor lighting or adverse weather conditions degrade camera performance, while radar suffers from noise and positional ambiguity. Achieving robust radar-camera 3D object detection requires consistent performance across varying conditions, a topic that has not yet been fully explored. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of robustness in radar-camera detection on five kinds of noises and propose RobuRCDet, a robust object detection model in BEV. Specifically, we design a 3D Gaussian Expansion (3DGE) module to mitigate inaccuracies in radar points, including position, Radar Cross-Section (RCS), and velocity. The 3DGE uses RCS and velocity priors to generate a deformable kernel map and variance for kernel size adjustment and value distribution. Additionally, we introduce a weather-adaptive fusion module, which adaptively fuses radar and camera features based on camera signal confidence. Extensive experiments on the popular benchmark, nuScenes, show that our model achieves competitive results in regular and noisy conditions.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 | None |
| **[Dynamic Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs for Long-term Language-Guided Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11989v5)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling mobile robots to perform long-term tasks in dynamic real-world environments is a formidable challenge, especially when the environment changes frequently due to human-robot interactions or the robot's own actions. Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

The leading force of this research is the problem of autonomous driving followed by indoor scene segmentation. However, openly available 3D data on these tasks mainly focuses on urban scenarios. In this paper, we propose TS40K, a 3D point cloud dataset that encompasses more than 40,000 Km on electrical transmission systems situated in European rural terrain. This is not only a novel problem for the research community that can aid in the high-risk mission of power-grid inspection, but it also offers 3D point clouds with distinct characteristics from those in self-driving and indoor 3D data, such as high point-density and no occlusion. In our dataset, each 3D point is labeled with 1 out of 22 annotated classes. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art methods on our dataset concerning 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the results along with key challenges such as using labels that were not originally intended for learning tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DAMamba: Vision State Space Model with Dynamic Adaptive Scan](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12627v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently garnered significant attention in computer vision. However, due to the unique characteristics of image data, adapting SSMs from natural language processing to computer vision has not outperformed the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

| **[Gaseous Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12415v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection, a fundamental and challenging problem in computer vision, has experienced rapid development due to the effectiveness of deep learning. The current objects to be detected are mostly rigid solid substances with apparent and distinct visual characteristics. In this paper, we endeavor on a scarcely explored task named Gaseous Object Detection (GOD), which is undertaken to explore whether the object detection techniques can be extended from solid substances to gaseous substances. Nevertheless, the gas exhibits significantly different visual characteristics: 1) saliency deficiency, 2) arbitrary and ever-changing shapes, 3) lack of distinct boundaries. To facilitate the study on this challenging task, we construct a GOD-Video dataset comprising 600 videos (141,017 frames) that cover various attributes with multiple types of gases. A comprehensive benchmark is established based on this dataset, allowing for a rigorous evaluation of frame-level and video-level detectors. Deduced from the Gaussian dispersion model, the physics-inspired Voxel Shift Field (VSF) is designed to model geometric irregularities and ever-changing shapes in potential 3D space. By integrating VSF into Faster RCNN, the VSF RCNN serves as a simple but strong baseline for gaseous object detection. Our work aims to attract further research into this valuable albeit challenging area.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[Intent3D: 3D Object Detection in RGB-D Scans Based on Human Intention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18295v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-life scenarios, humans seek out objects in the 3D world to fulfill their daily needs or intentions. This inspires us to introduce 3D intention grounding, a new task in 3D object detection employing RGB-D, based on human intention, such as "I want something to support my back". Closely related, 3D visual grounding focuses on understanding human reference. To achieve detection based on human intention, it relies on humans to observe the scene, reason out the target that aligns with their intention ("pillow" in this case), and finally provide a reference to the AI system, such as "A pillow on the couch". Instead, 3D intention grounding challenges AI agents to automatically observe, reason and detect the desired target solely based on human intention. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the new Intent3D dataset, consisting of 44,990 intention texts associated with 209 fine-grained classes from 1,042 scenes of the ScanNet dataset. We also establish several baselines based on different language-based 3D object detection models on our benchmark. Finally, we propose IntentNet, our unique approach, designed to tackle this intention-based detection problem. It focuses on three key aspects: intention understanding, reasoning to identify object candidates, and cascaded adaptive learning that leverages the intrinsic priority logic of different losses for multiple objective optimization.

However, the edges of clear objects have the highest contrast, which leads to stable and prominent features. We propose a novel approach by incorporating edge detection in a pre-processing step for the tasks of object detection and object pose estimation. We conducted experiments to investigate the effect of edge detectors on transparent objects. We examine the performance of the state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation pipeline GDR-Net and the object detector YOLOX when applying different edge detectors as pre-processing steps (i.e., Canny edge detection with and without color information, and holistically-nested edges (HED)). We evaluate the physically-based rendered dataset Trans6D-32 K of transparent objects with parameters proposed by the BOP Challenge.

The local interactions are derived from transforming a standard convolutional network, \textit{i.e.}, ConvNeXt, to design a more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4\% on ImageNet-1k with a latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

By delving into the analysis of knock-on feature hierarchy, we find that incremental learning typically progresses from low\-level representations to higher\-level semantics, whereas forgetting tends to occur in the opposite direction\-starting from high-level semantics and moving down to low-level features. Building upon this, we propose to benchmark the knowledge swapping task with the strategy of \textit{Learning Before Forgetting}. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

| **[Demystifying Catastrophic Forgetting in Two-Stage Incremental Object Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05540v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting is a critical chanllenge for incremental object detection (IOD). Most existing methods treat the detector monolithically, relying on instance replay or knowledge distillation without analyzing component-specific forgetting. Through dissection of Faster R-CNN, we reveal a key insight: Catastrophic forgetting is predominantly localized to the RoI Head classifier, while regressors retain robustness across incremental stages. This finding challenges conventional assumptions, motivating us to develop a framework termed NSGP-RePRE. Regional Prototype Replay (RePRE) mitigates classifier forgetting via replay of two types of prototypes: coarse prototypes represent class-wise semantic centers of RoI features, while fine-grained prototypes model intra-class variations. Null Space Gradient Projection (NSGP) is further introduced to eliminate prototype-feature misalignment by updating the feature extractor in directions orthogonal to subspace of old inputs via gradient projection, aligning RePRE with incremental learning dynamics. Our simple yet effective design allows NSGP-RePRE to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets under various settings. Our work not only advances IOD methodology but also provide pivotal insights for catastrophic forgetting mitigation in IOD.

It uses CCTV footage, for example, to record only major events-like the appearance of a person or a thief-so that storage is optimized and digital searches are easier. It utilizes the latest techniques in object detection and tracking, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN, as well as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), to achieve high accuracy in detection and capture temporal dependencies. The approach incorporates adaptive background modeling through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and optical flow methods like Lucas-Kanade to detect motions. Multi-scale and contextual analysis are used to improve detection across different object sizes and environments. A hybrid motion segmentation strategy combines statistical and deep learning models to manage complex movements, while optimizations for real-time processing ensure efficient computation. Tracking methods, such as Kalman Filters and Siamese networks, are employed to maintain smooth tracking even in cases of occlusion. Detection is improved on various-sized objects for multiple scenarios by multi-scale and contextual analysis. Results demonstrate high precision and recall in detecting and tracking objects, with significant improvements in processing times and accuracy due to real-time optimizations and illumination-invariant features. The impact of this research lies in its potential to transform video surveillance, reducing storage requirements and enhancing security through reliable and efficient object detection and tracking.</p></details> | 15 Pages, 7 Figures | None |
| **[CoDiff: Conditional Diffusion Model for Collaborative 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14891v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field of autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of each individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple agents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate detection of weeds at various growth stages is crucial for effective management yet challenging for farmers, as it requires identifying different species at multiple growth phases. This research addresses these challenges by utilizing advanced object detection models, specifically, the Detection Transformer (DETR) with a ResNet50 backbone and RetinaNet with a ResNeXt101 backbone, to identify and classify 16 weed species of economic concern across 174 classes, spanning their 11 weeks growth stages from seedling to maturity. A robust dataset comprising 203,567 images was developed, meticulously labeled by species and growth stage. The models were rigorously trained and evaluated, with RetinaNet demonstrating superior performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.907 on the training set and 0.904 on the test set, compared to DETR's mAP of 0.854 and 0.840, respectively. RetinaNet also outperformed DETR in recall and inference speed of 7.28 FPS, making it more suitable for real time applications. Both models showed improved accuracy as plants matured. This research provides crucial insights for developing precise, sustainable, and automated weed management strategies, paving the way for real time species specific detection systems and advancing AI-assisted agriculture through continued innovation in model development and early detection accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and Presented to ICMLA, 2024</p></details> | None |

Transformer-based architectures excel at capturing long-range dependencies but face efficiency challenges due to their quadratic attention complexity, which limits scalability in UDA tasks. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid domain-adaptive Mamba Transformer architecture that combines Mamba's efficient state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to tackle domain-specific spatial and channel-wise variations. Each hybrid block integrates domain-adaptive Mamba blocks and attention mechanisms: Domain-Adaptive Mamba employs spatial and channel state-space models to adaptively model domain variations, while attention mechanisms leverage self-attention for intra-domain feature enhancement and cross-attention for effective source-target alignment. Our approach processes both shallow and deeper features, employing an entropy-based knowledge distillation framework with margin ReLU to emphasize discriminative features and suppress noise. Gradient Reversal Layers enable adversarial alignment across network layers, while entropy-driven gating attention with random perturbations refines target features and mitigates overfitting. By unifying these components, our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in UDA object detection, balancing efficiency with robust generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this process is particularly challenging when using an electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) as the energy detector, due to their limited accuracy and efficiency in interacting with $\bar{n}$. To address this issue, we propose Vision Calorimeter (ViC), a data-driven framework which migrates visual object detection techniques to high-energy particle images. To accommodate the unique characteristics of particle images, we introduce the heat-conduction operator (HCO) into both the backbone and the head of the conventional object detector and conduct significant structural improvements. HCO enjoys the advantage of both radial prior and global attention, as it is inspired by physical heat conduction which naturally aligns with the pattern of particle incidence. Implemented via the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), HCO extracts frequency-domain features, bridging the distribution gap between the particle images and the natural images on which visual object detectors are pre-trained. Experimental results demonstrate that ViC significantly outperforms traditional approaches, reducing the incident position prediction error by 46.16% (from 17.31$^{\circ}$ to 9.32$^{\circ}$) and providing the first baseline result with an incident momentum regression error of 21.48%. This study underscores ViC's great potential as a general-purpose particle parameter estimator in high-energy physics.

However, they suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions due to the quality deterioration of LiDAR point clouds. Fusing LiDAR with the weather-robust 4D radar sensor is expected to solve this problem. However, the fusion of LiDAR and 4D radar is challenging because they differ significantly in terms of data quality and the degree of degradation in adverse weather. To address these issues, we introduce L4DR, a weather-robust 3D object detection method that effectively achieves LiDAR and 4D Radar fusion. Our L4DR includes Multi-Modal Encoding (MME) and Foreground-Aware Denoising (FAD) technique to reconcile sensor gaps, which is the first exploration of the complementarity of early fusion between LiDAR and 4D radar. Additionally, we design an Inter-Modal and Intra-Modal ({IM}2 ) parallel feature extraction backbone coupled with a Multi-Scale Gated Fusion (MSGF) module to counteract the varying degrees of sensor degradation under adverse weather conditions. Experimental evaluation on a VoD dataset with simulated fog proves that L4DR is more adaptable to changing weather conditions. It delivers a significant performance increase under different fog levels, improving the 3D mAP by up to 20.0% over the traditional LiDAR-only approach. Moreover, the results on the K-Radar dataset validate the consistent performance improvement of L4DR in real-world adverse weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI2025(Oral)</p></details> | None |

However, these models are computationally demanding, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments (e.g., self-driving cars). Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective compression method widely applied to CNN detectors, but its application to DETR models has been limited. Most KD methods for DETRs fail to distill transformer-specific global context. Also, they blindly believe in the teacher model, which can sometimes be misleading. To bridge the gaps, this paper proposes Consistent Location-and-Context-aware Knowledge Distillation (CLoCKDistill) for DETR detectors, which includes both feature distillation and logit distillation components. For feature distillation, instead of distilling backbone features like existing KD methods, we distill the transformer encoder output (i.e., memory) that contains valuable global context and long-range dependencies. Also, we enrich this memory with object location details during feature distillation so that the student model can prioritize relevant regions while effectively capturing the global context. To facilitate logit distillation, we create target-aware queries based on the ground truth, allowing both the student and teacher decoders to attend to consistent and accurate parts of encoder memory. Experiments on the KITTI and COCO datasets show our CLoCKDistill method's efficacy across various DETRs, e.g., single-scale DAB-DETR, multi-scale deformable DETR, and denoising-based DINO. Our method boosts student detector performance by 2.2% to 6.4%.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[Text-guided Sparse Voxel Pruning for Efficient 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10392v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-level convolution architecture for 3D visual grounding. Conventional methods are difficult to meet the requirements of real-time inference due to the two-stage or point-based architecture. Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional architecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding framework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding task the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text features, sparse convolution-based architecture is inefficient for this interaction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose text-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D scene representation and text features in an efficient way by gradual region pruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D scene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with text features by cross-attention. To mitigate the affect of pruning on delicate geometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel completion with negligible computational overhead. Compared with previous single-stage methods, our method achieves top inference speed and surpasses previous fastest method by 100\% FPS. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy even compared with two-stage methods, with $+1.13$ lead of Acc@0.5 on ScanRefer, and $+2.6$ and $+3.2$ leads on NR3D and SR3D respectively.

This study aimed to establish a solid baseline for the AI-automated assessment of findings in DPRs by developing, evaluating an AI system, and comparing its performance with that of human readers across multinational data sets. We analyzed 6,669 DPRs from three data sets (the Netherlands, Brazil, and Taiwan), focusing on 8 types of dental findings. The AI system combined object detection and semantic segmentation techniques for per-tooth finding identification. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). AI generalizability was tested across data sets, and performance was compared with human dental practitioners. The AI system demonstrated comparable or superior performance to human readers, particularly +67.9% (95% CI: 54.0%-81.9%; p < .001) sensitivity for identifying periapical radiolucencies and +4.7% (95% CI: 1.4%-8.0%; p = .008) sensitivity for identifying missing teeth. The AI achieved a macro-averaged AUC-ROC of 96.2% (95% CI: 94.6%-97.8%) across 8 findings. AI agreements with the reference were comparable to inter-human agreements in 7 of 8 findings except for caries (p = .024). The AI system demonstrated robust generalization across diverse imaging and demographic settings and processed images 79 times faster (95% CI: 75-82) than human readers. The AI system effectively assessed findings in DPRs, achieving performance on par with or better than human experts while significantly reducing interpretation time. These results highlight the potential for integrating AI into clinical workflows to improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, and patient management.</p></details> |  | None |

It serves as a valuable tool for sketch editing tasks, such as moving, scaling, or removing specific components. While image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, sketches present unique challenges for these models due to their sparse nature and wide variation in styles. We introduce SketchSeg, a method for instance segmentation of raster scene sketches. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art image segmentation and object detection models to the sketch domain by employing class-agnostic fine-tuning and refining segmentation masks using depth cues. Furthermore, our method organizes sketches into sorted layers, where occluded instances are inpainted, enabling advanced sketch editing applications. As existing datasets in this domain lack variation in sketch styles, we construct a synthetic scene sketch segmentation dataset featuring sketches with diverse brush strokes and varying levels of detail. We use this dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our approach and will release it to promote further research in the field.

However, existing open-vocabulary detectors, primarily trained on natural-world images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing images due to a significant data domain gap. Thus, this paper aims to advance the development of open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing community. To achieve this, we first reformulate the task as Locate Anything on Earth (LAE) with the goal of detecting any novel concepts on Earth. We then developed the LAE-Label Engine which collects, auto-annotates, and unifies up to 10 remote sensing datasets creating the LAE-1M - the first large-scale remote sensing object detection dataset with broad category coverage. Using the LAE-1M, we further propose and train the novel LAE-DINO Model, the first open-vocabulary foundation object detector for the LAE task, featuring Dynamic Vocabulary Construction (DVC) and Visual-Guided Text Prompt Learning (VisGT) modules. DVC dynamically constructs vocabulary for each training batch, while VisGT maps visual features to semantic space, enhancing text features. We comprehensively conduct experiments on established remote sensing benchmark DIOR, DOTAv2.0, as well as our newly introduced 80-class LAE-80C benchmark. Results demonstrate the advantages of the LAE-1M dataset and the effectiveness of the LAE-DINO method.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures | None |

To equip the detectors with orientation awareness, supervised regression/classification modules have been introduced at the high cost of rotation annotation. Meanwhile, some existing datasets with oriented objects are already annotated with horizontal boxes or even single points. It becomes attractive yet remains open for effectively utilizing weaker single point and horizontal annotations to train an oriented object detector (OOD). We develop Wholly-WOOD, a weakly-supervised OOD framework, capable of wholly leveraging various labeling forms (Points, HBoxes, RBoxes, and their combination) in a unified fashion. By only using HBox for training, our Wholly-WOOD achieves performance very close to that of the RBox-trained counterpart on remote sensing and other areas, significantly reducing the tedious efforts on labor-intensive annotation for oriented objects.

However, existing object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which poses a significant challenge to their reliability and security. Through experiments, first, we found that existing works on improving the adversarial robustness of object detectors give a false sense of security. Second, we found that adversarially pre-trained backbone networks were essential for enhancing the adversarial robustness of object detectors. We then proposed a simple yet effective recipe for fast adversarial fine-tuning on object detectors with adversarially pre-trained backbones. Without any modifications to the structure of object detectors, our recipe achieved significantly better adversarial robustness than previous works. Finally, we explored the potential of different modern object detector designs for improving adversarial robustness with our recipe and demonstrated interesting findings, which inspired us to design state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust detectors. Our empirical results set a new milestone for adversarially robust object detection.

In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, this process is often complex and labor-intensive for sound designers, requiring precise synchronization of audio with the spatial positions of visual components. To address these challenges, we propose a visual-based spatial audio generation system - an automated system that integrates face detection YOLOv8 for object detection, monocular depth estimation, and spatial audio techniques. Notably, the system operates without requiring additional binaural dataset training. The proposed system is evaluated against existing Spatial Audio generation system using objective metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves spatial consistency between audio and video, enhances speech quality, and performs robustly in multi-speaker scenarios. By streamlining the audio-visual alignment process, the proposed system enables sound engineers to achieve high-quality results efficiently, making it a valuable tool for professionals in multimedia production.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mitigating the Impact of Prominent Position Shift in Drone-based RGBT Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09311v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based RGBT object detection plays a crucial role in many around-the-clock applications. However, real-world drone-viewed RGBT data suffers from the prominent position shift problem, i.e., the position of a tiny object differs greatly in different modalities. For instance, a slight deviation of a tiny object in the thermal modality will induce it to drift from the main body of itself in the RGB modality. Considering RGBT data are usually labeled on one modality (reference), this will cause the unlabeled modality (sensed) to lack accurate supervision signals and prevent the detector from learning a good representation. Moreover, the mismatch of the corresponding feature point between the modalities will make the fused features confusing for the detection head. In this paper, we propose to cast the cross-modality box shift issue as the label noise problem and address it on the fly via a novel Mean Teacher-based Cross-modality Box Correction head ensemble (CBC). In this way, the network can learn more informative representations for both modalities. Furthermore, to alleviate the feature map mismatch problem in RGBT fusion, we devise a Shifted Window-Based Cascaded Alignment (SWCA) module. SWCA mines long-range dependencies between the spatially unaligned features inside shifted windows and cascaded aligns the sensed features with the reference ones. Extensive experiments on two drone-based RGBT object detection datasets demonstrate that the correction results are both visually and quantitatively favorable, thereby improving the detection performance. In particular, our CBC module boosts the precision of the sensed modality ground truth by 25.52 aSim points. Overall, the proposed detector achieves an mAP_50 of 43.55 points on RGBTDronePerson and surpasses a state-of-the-art method by 8.6 mAP50 on a shift subset of DroneVehicle dataset. The code and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we prove the utility of this database by training an original two-stage deep object detection model tailored for the processing of audio data. While allowing the precise localization of bird calls in spectrograms, this model shows competitive accuracy on the 45 main species of the dataset with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger audio collections. These results highlight the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files.

| **[Open-YOLO 3D: Towards Fast and Accurate Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02548v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation show strong promise, but at the cost of slow inference speed and high computation requirements. This high computation cost is typically due to their heavy reliance on 3D clip features, which require computationally expensive 2D foundation models like Segment Anything (SAM) and CLIP for multi-view aggregation into 3D. As a consequence, this hampers their applicability in many real-world applications that require both fast and accurate predictions. To this end, we propose a fast yet accurate open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation approach, named Open-YOLO 3D, that effectively leverages only 2D object detection from multi-view RGB images for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. We address this task by generating class-agnostic 3D masks for objects in the scene and associating them with text prompts. We observe that the projection of class-agnostic 3D point cloud instances already holds instance information; thus, using SAM might only result in redundancy that unnecessarily increases the inference time. We empirically find that a better performance of matching text prompts to 3D masks can be achieved in a faster fashion with a 2D object detector. We validate our Open-YOLO 3D on two benchmarks, ScanNet200 and Replica, under two scenarios: (i) with ground truth masks, where labels are required for given object proposals, and (ii) with class-agnostic 3D proposals generated from a 3D proposal network. Our Open-YOLO 3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while obtaining up to $\sim$16$\times$ speedup compared to the best existing method in literature. On ScanNet200 val. set, our Open-YOLO 3D achieves mean average precision (mAP) of 24.7\% while operating at 22 seconds per scene.

Most existing methods follow conventional 2D detectors to first localize object centers, and then predict 3D attributes by neighboring features. However, only using local visual features is insufficient to understand the scene-level 3D spatial structures and ignores the long-range inter-object depth relations. In this paper, we introduce the first DETR framework for Monocular DEtection with a depth-guided TRansformer, named MonoDETR. We modify the vanilla transformer to be depth-aware and guide the whole detection process by contextual depth cues. Specifically, concurrent to the visual encoder that captures object appearances, we introduce to predict a foreground depth map, and specialize a depth encoder to extract non-local depth embeddings. Then, we formulate 3D object candidates as learnable queries and propose a depth-guided decoder to conduct object-scene depth interactions. In this way, each object query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the depth-guided regions on the image and is no longer constrained to local visual features. On KITTI benchmark with monocular images as input, MonoDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires no extra dense depth annotations. Besides, our depth-guided modules can also be plug-and-play to enhance multi-view 3D object detectors on nuScenes dataset, demonstrating our superior generalization capacity.

However, existing datasets face challenges such as limited modalities, high construction costs, and imprecise annotations. To this end, we propose a synthetic multi-modal UAV-based multi-task dataset, UEMM-Air. Specifically, we simulate various UAV flight scenarios and object types using the Unreal Engine (UE). Then we design the UAV's flight logic to automatically collect data from different scenarios, perspectives, and altitudes. Furthermore, we propose a novel heuristic automatic annotation algorithm to generate accurate object detection labels. Finally, we utilize labels to generate text descriptions of images to make our UEMM-Air support more cross-modality tasks. In total, our UEMM-Air consists of 120k pairs of images with 6 modalities and precise annotations. Moreover, we conduct numerous experiments and establish new benchmark results on our dataset. We also found that models pre-trained on UEMM-Air exhibit better performance on downstream tasks compared to other similar datasets. The dataset is publicly available (https://github.com/1e12Leon/UEMM-Air) to support the research of multi-modal tasks on UAVs.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/1e12Leon/UEMM-Air) |

This is especially true with deep learning, as today, many popular user services are powered by neural networks in the cloud. Beyond its well-known high computational costs, one of the major challenges facing wide-scale deployment of FHE-secured neural inference is effectively mapping these networks to FHE primitives. FHE poses many programming challenges including packing large vectors, managing accumulated noise, and translating arbitrary and general-purpose programs to the limited instruction set provided by FHE. These challenges make building large FHE neural networks intractable using the tools available today. In this paper we address these challenges with Orion, a fully-automated framework for private neural inference using FHE. Orion accepts deep neural networks written in PyTorch and translates them into efficient FHE programs. We achieve this by proposing a novel single-shot multiplexed packing strategy for arbitrary convolutions and through a new, efficient technique to automate bootstrap placement and scale management. We evaluate Orion on common benchmarks used by the FHE deep learning community and outperform state-of-the-art by 2.38x on ResNet-20, the largest network they report. Orion's techniques enable processing much deeper and larger networks. We demonstrate this by evaluating ResNet-50 on ImageNet and present the first high-resolution FHE object detection experiments using a YOLO-v1 model with 139 million parameters.

A key step toward developing trustworthy COD systems is the estimation and effective utilization of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a human-machine collaboration framework for classifying the presence of camouflaged objects, leveraging the complementary strengths of computer vision (CV) models and noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our approach introduces a multiview backbone to estimate uncertainty in CV model predictions, utilizes this uncertainty during training to improve efficiency, and defers low-confidence cases to human evaluation via RSVP-based BCIs during testing for more reliable decision-making. We evaluated the framework in the CAMO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 4.56\% in balanced accuracy (BA) and 3.66\% in the F1 score compared to existing methods. For the best-performing participants, the improvements reached 7.6\% in BA and 6.66\% in the F1 score. Analysis of the training process revealed a strong correlation between our confidence measures and precision, while an ablation study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed training policy and the human-machine collaboration strategy. In general, this work reduces human cognitive load, improves system reliability, and provides a strong foundation for advancements in real-world COD applications and human-computer interaction.

Flawless monitoring of tree health helps farmers make informed decisions regarding their management by taking appropriate action. Use of drone images for automatic plantation monitoring can enhance the accuracy of the monitoring process, while still being affordable to small farmers in developing countries such as India. Small, low cost drones equipped with an RGB camera can capture high-resolution images of agricultural fields, allowing for detailed analysis of the well-being of the plantations. Existing methods of automated plantation monitoring are mostly based on satellite images, which are difficult to get for the farmers. We propose an automated system for plantation health monitoring using drone images, which are becoming easier to get for the farmers. We propose a dataset of images of trees with three categories: ``Good health", ``Stunted", and ``Dead". We annotate the dataset using CVAT annotation tool, for use in research purposes. We experiment with different well-known CNN models to observe their performance on the proposed dataset. The initial low accuracy levels show the complexity of the proposed dataset. Further, our study revealed that, depth-wise convolution operation embedded in a deep CNN model, can enhance the performance of the model on drone dataset. Further, we apply state-of-the-art object detection models to identify individual trees to better monitor them automatically.</p></details> |  | None |

This article introduces a novel channel-adaptive and multi-task-aware semantic communication framework based on a masked auto-encoder architecture. Our framework optimizes the transmission of meaningful information by incorporating a multi-task-aware scoring mechanism that identifies and prioritizes semantically significant data across multiple concurrent tasks. A channel-aware extractor is employed to dynamically select relevant information in response to real-time channel conditions. By jointly optimizing semantic relevance and transmission efficiency, the framework ensures minimal performance degradation under resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework compared to conventional methods in tasks such as image reconstruction and object detection. These results underscore the framework's adaptability to heterogeneous channel environments and its scalability for multi-task applications, positioning it as a promising solution for next-generation semantic communication networks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, collaborative perception is envisioned to improve perceptual accuracy by using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to enable collaboration among connected and autonomous vehicles and roadside units. However, due to limited communication resources, it is impractical for all units to transmit sensing data such as point clouds or high-definition video. As a result, it is essential to optimize the scheduling of communication links to ensure efficient spectrum utilization for the exchange of perceptual data. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based V2X user scheduling algorithm for collaborative perception. Given the challenges in acquiring perceptual labels, we reformulate the conventional label-dependent objective into a label-free goal, based on characteristics of 3D object detection. Incorporating both channel state information (CSI) and semantic information, we develop a double deep Q-Network (DDQN)-based user scheduling framework for collaborative perception, named SchedCP. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of SchedCP compared with traditional V2X scheduling methods. Finally, we present a case study to illustrate how our proposed algorithm adaptively modifies the scheduling decisions by taking both instantaneous CSI and perceptual semantics into account.</p></details> |  | None |

While LiDAR performance deteriorates in challenging weather, Radar systems maintain their reliability. Traditional Radars have limitations due to their lack of elevation data, but the recent 4D Radars overcome this by measuring elevation alongside range, azimuth, and Doppler velocity, making them invaluable for autonomous vehicles. The primary challenge in utilizing 4D Radars is the sparsity of their point clouds. Previous works address this by developing architectures that better capture semantics and context in sparse point cloud, largely drawing from LiDAR-based approaches. However, these methods often overlook a unique advantage of 4D Radars: the dense Radar tensor, which encapsulates power measurements across three spatial dimensions and the Doppler dimension. Our paper leverages this tensor to tackle the sparsity issue. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables a student model to densify its sparse input in the latent space by emulating an ensemble of teacher models. Our experiments demonstrate a 25% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art RTNH model on the K-Radar dataset. Notably, this improvement is achieved while still maintaining a real-time inference speed.</p></details> | Arxiv preprint | None |

Existing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems relying on gestures or verbal commands are impractical for the elderly due to difficulties with complex syntax or sign language. To address the challenge, this paper introduces a multi-modal interaction framework that combines voice and deictic posture information to create a more natural HRI system. The visual cues are first processed by the object detection model to gain a global understanding of the environment, and then bounding boxes are estimated based on depth information. By using a large language model (LLM) with voice-to-text commands and temporally aligned selected bounding boxes, robot action sequences can be generated, while key control syntax constraints are applied to avoid potential LLM hallucination issues. The system is evaluated on real-world tasks with varying levels of complexity using a Universal Robots UR3e manipulator. Our method demonstrates significantly better performance in HRI in terms of accuracy and robustness. To benefit the research community and the general public, we will make our code and design open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine on 11 Feb 2025</p></details> | None |

While human vision adapts dynamically to environmental conditions, computational dehazing does not always enhance detection uniformly. We propose a multi-stage framework where a lightweight detector identifies regions of interest (RoIs), which are then enhanced via spatial attention-based dehazing before final detection by a heavier model. Though effective in foggy conditions, this approach unexpectedly degrades the performance on clear images. We analyze this phenomenon, investigate possible causes, and offer insights for designing hybrid pipelines that balance enhancement and detection. Our findings highlight the need for selective preprocessing and challenge assumptions about universal benefits from cascading transformations.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method introduces learnable spatial relationships between object queries through a relation-aware self-attention mechanism, which adaptively learns to balance different scales of relations (local, medium and global) across decoder layers. This progressive design enables the model to effectively capture evolving spatial dependencies throughout the detection pipeline. Extensive experiments on COCO 2017 dataset demonstrate that our method improves both convergence speed and detection accuracy compared to standard self-attention module. The proposed method achieves competitive results, reaching 52.3\% AP with 12 epochs and 52.5\% AP with 24 epochs using ResNet-50 backbone, and further improving to 58.0\% AP with Swin-L backbone. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an interesting pattern: the model naturally learns to prioritize local spatial relations in early decoder layers while gradually shifting attention to broader contexts in deeper layers, providing valuable insights for future research in object detection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |

Supervised anomaly segmentation or open-world object detection models depend on training on exhaustively annotated datasets for every domain and still struggle in distinguishing between background and OOD objects. In this work, we present a plug-and-play framework - PRototype-based OOD detection Without Labels (PROWL). It is an inference-based method that does not require training on the domain dataset and relies on extracting relevant features from self-supervised pre-trained models. PROWL can be easily adapted to detect in-domain objects in any operational design domain (ODD) in a zero-shot manner by specifying a list of known classes from this domain. PROWL, as a first zero-shot unsupervised method, achieves state-of-the-art results on the RoadAnomaly and RoadObstacle datasets provided in road driving benchmarks - SegmentMeIfYouCan (SMIYC) and Fishyscapes, as well as comparable performance against existing supervised methods trained without auxiliary OOD data.

Yet, gaze shifts and selective attention are critical for perceiving details and refining object boundaries. Object segmentation and gaze behavior are, however, typically treated as two independent processes. Here, we present a computational model that simulates these processes in an interconnected manner and allows for hypothesis-driven investigations of distinct attentional mechanisms. Drawing on an information processing pattern from robotics, we use a Bayesian filter to recursively segment the scene, which also provides an uncertainty estimate for the object boundaries that we use to guide active scene exploration. We demonstrate that this model closely resembles observers' free viewing behavior on a dataset of dynamic real-world scenes, measured by scanpath statistics, including foveation duration and saccade amplitude distributions used for parameter fitting and higher-level statistics not used for fitting. These include how object detections, inspections, and returns are balanced and a delay of returning saccades without an explicit implementation of such temporal inhibition of return. Extensive simulations and ablation studies show that uncertainty promotes balanced exploration and that semantic object cues are crucial to forming the perceptual units used in object-based attention. Moreover, we show how our model's modular design allows for extensions, such as incorporating saccadic momentum or pre-saccadic attention, to further align its output with human scanpaths.</p></details> | <details><summary>40+25...</summary><p>40+25 pages, 8+7 figures</p></details> | None |

Several thousand such paintings exist, but a quantitative analysis of them has not been carried out. We created an extensive dataset of 1,939 Holocaust prisoner artworks, and we employed an object detection framework that found 19,377 objects within these artworks. To support the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the art collection and its objects, we have developed an intuitive and interactive dashboard to promote a deeper engagement with these visual testimonies. The dashboard features various visual interfaces, e.g., a word cloud showing the detected objects and a map of artwork origins, and options for filtering. We presented the interface to domain experts, whose feedback highlights the dashboard's intuitiveness and potential for both quantitative and qualitative analysis while also providing relevant suggestions for improvement. Our project demonstrates the benefit of digital methods such as machine learning and visual analytics for Holocaust remembrance and educational purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Prague Visual History and Digital Humanities Conference (PRAVIDCO) 2025</p></details> | None |

The driving scene perception system fundamentally represents an object detection task that requires achieving a balance between accuracy and processing speed. Many contemporary methods focus on improving detection accuracy but often overlook the importance of real-time detection capabilities when computational resources are limited. Thus, it is vital to investigate efficient object detection strategies for driving scenes. This paper introduces Fast-COS, a novel single-stage object detection framework crafted specifically for driving scene applications. The research initiates with an analysis of the backbone, considering both macro and micro architectural designs, yielding the Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer (RAViT). RAViT utilizes Reparameterized Multi-Scale Depth-Wise Convolution (RepMSDW) and Reparameterized Self-Attention (RepSA) to enhance computational efficiency and feature extraction. In extensive tests across GPU, edge, and mobile platforms, RAViT achieves 81.4% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset, demonstrating significant throughput improvements over comparable backbone models such as ResNet, FastViT, RepViT, and EfficientFormer. Additionally, integrating RepMSDW into a feature pyramid network forms RepFPN, enabling fast and multi-scale feature fusion. Fast-COS enhances object detection in driving scenes, attaining an AP50 score of 57.2% on the BDD100K dataset and 80.0% on the TJU-DHD Traffic dataset. It surpasses leading models in efficiency, delivering up to 75.9% faster GPU inference and 1.38 higher throughput on edge devices compared to FCOS, YOLOF, and RetinaNet. These findings establish Fast-COS as a highly scalable and reliable solution suitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-limited environments like autonomous driving systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review on IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> | None |

However, adverse imaging conditions such as haze during the day, low light, and haze at night severely degrade image quality, and complicating the SOD process. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task-oriented nighttime haze imaging enhancer (MToIE), which integrates three tasks: daytime dehazing, low-light enhancement, and nighttime dehazing. The MToIE incorporates two key innovative components: First, the network employs a task-oriented node learning mechanism to handle three specific degradation types: day-time haze, low light, and night-time haze conditions, with an embedded self-attention module enhancing its performance in nighttime imaging. In addition, multi-receptive field enhancement module that efficiently extracts multi-scale features through three parallel depthwise separable convolution branches with different dilation rates, capturing comprehensive spatial information with minimal computational overhead. To ensure optimal image reconstruction quality and visual characteristics, we suggest a hybrid loss function. Extensive experiments on different types of weather/imaging conditions illustrate that MToIE surpasses existing methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of vision systems across diverse imaging scenarios.

However, unlike close-up shots in the MS COCO dataset, the higher resolution and wider field of view raise unique challenges, such as extreme sparsity and huge scale changes, causing existing close-up detectors inaccuracy and inefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic sparse vision transformer, dubbed SparseFormer, to bridge the gap of object detection between close-up and HRW shots. The proposed SparseFormer selectively uses attentive tokens to scrutinize the sparsely distributed windows that may contain objects. In this way, it can jointly explore global and local attention by fusing coarse- and fine-grained features to handle huge scale changes. SparseFormer also benefits from a novel Cross-slice non-maximum suppression (C-NMS) algorithm to precisely localize objects from noisy windows and a simple yet effective multi-scale strategy to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments on two HRW benchmarks, PANDA and DOTA-v1.0, demonstrate that the proposed SparseFormer significantly improves detection accuracy (up to 5.8%) and speed (up to 3x) over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ACM MM 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Dense Object Detection Based on De-homogenized Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07194v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense object detection is widely used in automatic driving, video surveillance, and other fields. This paper focuses on the challenging task of dense object detection. Currently, detection methods based on greedy algorithms, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS), often produce many repetitive predictions or missed detections in dense scenarios, which is a common problem faced by NMS-based algorithms. Through the end-to-end DETR (DEtection TRansformer), as a type of detector that can incorporate the post-processing de-duplication capability of NMS, etc., into the network, we found that homogeneous queries in the query-based detector lead to a reduction in the de-duplication capability of the network and the learning efficiency of the encoder, resulting in duplicate prediction and missed detection problems. To solve this problem, we propose learnable differentiated encoding to de-homogenize the queries, and at the same time, queries can communicate with each other via differentiated encoding information, replacing the previous self-attention among the queries. In addition, we used joint loss on the output of the encoder that considered both location and confidence prediction to give a higher-quality initialization for queries. Without cumbersome decoder stacking and guaranteeing accuracy, our proposed end-to-end detection framework was more concise and reduced the number of parameters by about 8% compared to deformable DETR. Our method achieved excellent results on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset with 93.6% average precision (AP), 39.2% MR-2, and 84.3% JI. The performance overperformed previous SOTA methods, such as Iter-E2EDet (Progressive End-to-End Object Detection) and MIP (One proposal, Multiple predictions). In addition, our method is more robust in various scenarios with different densities.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures | None |
| **[Foreign-Object Detection in High-Voltage Transmission Line Based on Improved YOLOv8m](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07175v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safe operation of high-voltage transmission lines ensures the power grid's security. Various foreign objects attached to the transmission lines, such as balloons, kites and nesting birds, can significantly affect the safe and stable operation of high-voltage transmission lines. With the advancement of computer vision technology, periodic automatic inspection of foreign objects is efficient and necessary. Existing detection methods have low accuracy because foreign objects at-tached to the transmission lines are complex, including occlusions, diverse object types, significant scale variations, and complex backgrounds. In response to the practical needs of the Yunnan Branch of China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd., this paper proposes an improved YOLOv8m-based model for detecting foreign objects on transmission lines. Experiments are conducted on a dataset collected from Yunnan Power Grid. The proposed model enhances the original YOLOv8m by in-corporating a Global Attention Module (GAM) into the backbone to focus on occluded foreign objects, replacing the SPPF module with the SPPCSPC module to augment the model's multiscale feature extraction capability, and introducing the Focal-EIoU loss function to address the issue of high- and low-quality sample imbalances. These improvements accelerate model convergence and enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves a 2.7% increase in mAP_0.5, a 4% increase in mAP_0.5:0.95, and a 6% increase in recall.</p></details> | 24 pages, 16 figures | None |

For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

While traditional planners and classical optimisation methods have been extensively used to address this dynamic problem, they often face real-time, unpredictable changes that ultimately leads to sub-optimal performance in terms of adaptiveness and real-time decision making. In this work, we propose a novel motion planner, AgilePilot, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that is trained in dynamic conditions, coupled with real-time Computer Vision (CV) for object detections during flight. The training-to-deployment framework bridges the Sim2Real gap, leveraging sophisticated reward structures that promotes both safety and agility depending upon environment conditions. The system can rapidly adapt to changing environments, while achieving a maximum speed of 3.0 m/s in real-world scenarios. In comparison, our approach outperforms classical algorithms such as Artificial Potential Field (APF) based motion planner by 3 times, both in performance and tracking accuracy of dynamic targets by using velocity predictions while exhibiting 90% success rate in 75 conducted experiments. This work highlights the effectiveness of DRL in tackling real-time dynamic navigation challenges, offering intelligent safety and agility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript has been submitted to 2025 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (ICUAS)</p></details> | None |

Despite recent progress, current CP methods expand the ego vehicle's 360-degree perceptual range almost equally, which faces two key challenges. Firstly, in areas with uneven traffic distribution, focusing on directions with little traffic offers limited benefits. Secondly, under limited communication budgets, allocating excessive bandwidth to less critical directions lowers the perception accuracy in more vital areas. To address these issues, we propose Direct-CP, a proactive and direction-aware CP system aiming at improving CP in specific directions. Our key idea is to enable an ego vehicle to proactively signal its interested directions and readjust its attention to enhance local directional CP performance. To achieve this, we first propose an RSU-aided direction masking mechanism that assists an ego vehicle in identifying vital directions. Additionally, we design a direction-aware selective attention module to wisely aggregate pertinent features based on ego vehicle's directional priorities, communication budget, and the positional data of CAVs. Moreover, we introduce a direction-weighted detection loss (DWLoss) to capture the divergence between directional CP outcomes and the ground truth, facilitating effective model training. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 19.8\% higher local perception accuracy in interested directions and 2.5\% higher overall perception accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods in collaborative 3D object detection tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA'25 | None |

Existing solutions for managing computational resources often focus narrowly on accuracy or energy efficiency, failing to adapt dynamically to varying workloads. Furthermore, the existing system lack robust mechanisms to adaptively balance CPU utilization, leading to inefficiencies in resource-constrained scenarios like real-time traffic monitoring. To address these limitations, we propose a self-adaptive approach that optimizes CPU utilization and resource management on edge devices. Our approach, EdgeMLBalancer balances between models through dynamic switching, guided by real-time CPU usage monitoring across processor cores. Tested on real-time traffic data, the approach adapts object detection models based on CPU usage, ensuring efficient resource utilization. The approach leverages epsilon-greedy strategy which promotes fairness and prevents resource starvation, maintaining system robustness. The results of our evaluation demonstrate significant improvements by balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, highlighting the approach's ability to adapt seamlessly to varying workloads. This work lays the groundwork for further advancements in self-adaptation for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Amnesia as a Catalyst for Enhancing Black Box Pixel Attacks in Image Classification and Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07821v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that query-based attacks tend to have relatively higher success rates in adversarial black-box attacks. While research on black-box attacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on pixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image classification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily depend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more suitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, query-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box attack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement Learning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget processes. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging rewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR effectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while adhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed attack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the confidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed state-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the MSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction to state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query. Further experiments on the Argoverse dataset using YOLOv8 confirm that RFPAR effectively removed objects on a larger scale dataset.

Intelligent inspection of power transmission lines has become increasingly important. However, subsequent intelligent inspection relies on accurately detecting various key components. Due to the low detection accuracy of key components in transmission line image inspection, this paper proposed an improved object detection model based on the YOLOv5s (You Only Look Once Version 5 Small) model to improve the detection accuracy of key components of transmission lines. According to the characteristics of the power grid inspection image, we first modify the distance measurement in the k-means clustering to improve the anchor matching of the YOLOv5s model. Then, we add the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) attention mechanism to the backbone network to improve accuracy. Finally, we apply the focal loss function to reduce the impact of class imbalance. Our improved method's mAP (mean average precision) reached 98.1%, the precision reached 97.5%, the recall reached 94.4%, and the detection rate reached 84.8 FPS (frames per second).

However, existing deep learning-based RGB-T SOD models suffer from two major limitations. First, Transformer-based models with quadratic complexity are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting their application in high-resolution bi-modal feature fusion. Second, even when these models converge to an optimal solution, there remains a frequency gap between the prediction and ground-truth. To overcome these limitations, we propose a purely Fourier transform-based model, namely Deep Fourier-Embedded Network (DFENet), for accurate RGB-T SOD. To address the computational complexity when dealing with high-resolution images, we leverage the efficiency of fast Fourier transform with linear complexity to design three key components: (1) the Modal-coordinated Perception Attention, which fuses RGB and thermal modalities with enhanced multi-dimensional representation; (2) the Frequency-decomposed Edge-aware Block, which clarifies object edges by deeply decomposing and enhancing frequency components of low-level features; and (3) the Fourier Residual Channel Attention Block, which prioritizes high-frequency information while aligning channel-wise global relationships. To mitigate the frequency gap, we propose Co-focus Frequency Loss, which dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing bi-modal edge information in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on four RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate that DFENet outperforms fifteen existing state-of-the-art RGB-T SOD models. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the value and effectiveness of our newly proposed components.

While most studies focus on cross-dataset shifts, such as changes in environments and object geometries, practical corruptions from sensor variations and weather conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel online test-time adaptation framework for 3D detectors that effectively tackles these shifts, including a challenging cross-corruption scenario where cross-dataset shifts and corruptions co-occur. By leveraging long-term knowledge from previous test batches, our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and adapts effectively to diverse shifts. Specifically, we propose a Model Synergy (MOS) strategy that dynamically selects historical checkpoints with diverse knowledge and assembles them to best accommodate the current test batch. This assembly is directed by our proposed Synergy Weights (SW), which perform a weighted averaging of the selected checkpoints, minimizing redundancy in the composite model. The SWs are computed by evaluating the similarity of predicted bounding boxes on the test data and the independence of features between checkpoint pairs in the model bank. To maintain an efficient and informative model bank, we discard checkpoints with the lowest average SW scores, replacing them with newly updated models. Our method was rigorously tested against existing test-time adaptation strategies across three datasets and eight types of corruptions, demonstrating superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and conditions. Notably, it achieved a 67.3% improvement in a challenging cross-corruption scenario, offering a more comprehensive benchmark for adaptation.

This paper addresses the need for privacy-preserving solutions in large-scale visual data processing by leveraging federated learning. Although there have been developments in this field, previous research has mainly focused on integrating object detection with either anonymization or federated learning. However, these pairs often fail to address complex privacy concerns. On the one hand, object detection with anonymization alone can be vulnerable to reverse techniques. On the other hand, federated learning may not provide sufficient privacy guarantees. Therefore, we propose a new approach that combines object detection, federated learning and anonymization. Combining these three components aims to offer a robust privacy protection strategy by addressing different vulnerabilities in visual data. Our solution is evaluated against traditional centralized models, showing that while there is a slight trade-off in accuracy, the privacy benefits are substantial, making it well-suited for privacy sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, architectures based on deep neural networks have started to yield diminishing returns, primarily due to their statistical nature and inability to capture causal structure in the training data. Another issue with deep learning is its high energy consumption, which is not that desirable from a sustainability perspective. Therefore, alternative approaches are being considered to address these issues, both of which are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. One approach is causal learning, which takes into account causality among the items in the dataset on which the neural network is trained. It is expected that this will help minimize the spurious correlations that are prevalent in the learned representations of deep neural networks. The other approach is Neurochaos Learning, a recent development, which draws its inspiration from the nonlinear chaotic firing intrinsic to neurons in biological neural networks (brain/central nervous system). Both approaches have shown improved results over just deep learning alone. To that end, in this position paper, we investigate how causal and neurochaos learning approaches can be integrated together to produce better results, especially in domains that contain linked data. We propose an approach for this integration to enhance classification, prediction and reinforcement learning. We also propose a set of research questions that need to be investigated in order to make this integration a reality.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

Nevertheless, a prevalent limitation in existing models is overemphasizing the current input while ignoring the information from the entire dataset. We introduce an innovative Retriever-Dictionary (RD) module to address this issue. This architecture enables YOLO-based models to efficiently retrieve features from a Dictionary that contains the insight of the dataset, which is built by the knowledge from Visual Models (VM), Large Language Models (LLM), or Visual Language Models (VLM). The flexible RD enables the model to incorporate such explicit knowledge that enhances the ability to benefit multiple tasks, specifically, segmentation, detection, and classification, from pixel to image level. The experiments show that using the RD significantly improves model performance, achieving more than a 3\% increase in mean Average Precision for object detection with less than a 1% increase in model parameters. Beyond 1-stage object detection models, the RD module improves the effectiveness of 2-stage models and DETR-based architectures, such as Faster R-CNN and Deformable DETR.

Existing methods for salmon counting using high-resolution imaging sonar hardware are non-invasive and compatible with computer vision processing. Prior work in this area has utilized object detection and tracking based methods for automated salmon counting. However, these techniques remain inaccessible to many sonar deployment sites due to limited compute and connectivity in the field. We propose an alternative lightweight computer vision method for fish counting based on analyzing echograms - temporal representations that compress several hundred frames of imaging sonar video into a single image. We predict upstream and downstream counts within 200-frame time windows directly from echograms using a ResNet-18 model, and propose a set of domain-specific image augmentations and a weakly-supervised training protocol to further improve results. We achieve a count error of 23% on representative data from the Kenai River in Alaska, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024. 6 pages, 2 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[DetVPCC: RoI-based Point Cloud Sequence Compression for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04804v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While MPEG-standardized video-based point cloud compression (VPCC) achieves high compression efficiency for human perception, it struggles with a poor trade-off between bitrate savings and detection accuracy when supporting 3D object detectors. This limitation stems from VPCC's inability to prioritize regions of different importance within point clouds. To address this issue, we propose DetVPCC, a novel method integrating region-of-interest (RoI) encoding with VPCC for efficient point cloud sequence compression while preserving the 3D object detection accuracy. Specifically, we augment VPCC to support RoI-based compression by assigning spatially non-uniform quality levels. Then, we introduce a lightweight RoI detector to identify crucial regions that potentially contain objects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the detection accuracy. The code and demo video are available in supplementary materials.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DiPEx: Dispersing Prompt Expansion for Class-Agnostic Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14924v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-agnostic object detection (OD) can be a cornerstone or a bottleneck for many downstream vision tasks. Despite considerable advancements in bottom-up and multi-object discovery methods that leverage basic visual cues to identify salient objects, consistently achieving a high recall rate remains difficult due to the diversity of object types and their contextual complexity. In this work, we investigate using vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance object detection via a self-supervised prompt learning strategy. Our initial findings indicate that manually crafted text queries often result in undetected objects, primarily because detection confidence diminishes when the query words exhibit semantic overlap. To address this, we propose a Dispersing Prompt Expansion (DiPEx) approach. DiPEx progressively learns to expand a set of distinct, non-overlapping hyperspherical prompts to enhance recall rates, thereby improving performance in downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution OD. Specifically, DiPEx initiates the process by self-training generic parent prompts and selecting the one with the highest semantic uncertainty for further expansion. The resulting child prompts are expected to inherit semantics from their parent prompts while capturing more fine-grained semantics. We apply dispersion losses to ensure high inter-class discrepancy among child prompts while preserving semantic consistency between parent-child prompt pairs. To prevent excessive growth of the prompt sets, we utilize the maximum angular coverage (MAC) of the semantic space as a criterion for early termination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiPEx through extensive class-agnostic OD and OOD-OD experiments on MS-COCO and LVIS, surpassing other prompting methods by up to 20.1\% in AR and achieving a 21.3\% AP improvement over SAM.

However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification and object detection problems, demonstrating the potential of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone.

Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we rethink this challenging task setting with the layout among instances and present Point2RBox-v2. At the core are three principles: 1) Gaussian overlap loss. It learns an upper bound for each instance by treating objects as 2D Gaussian distributions and minimizing their overlap. 2) Voronoi watershed loss. It learns a lower bound for each instance through watershed on Voronoi tessellation. 3) Consistency loss. It learns the size/rotation variation between two output sets with respect to an input image and its augmented view. Supplemented by a few devised techniques, e.g. edge loss and copy-paste, the detector is further enhanced. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox-v2 is the first approach to explore the spatial layout among instances for learning point-supervised OOD. Our solution is elegant and lightweight, yet it is expected to give a competitive performance especially in densely packed scenes: 62.61%/86.15%/34.71% on DOTA/HRSC/FAIR1M.

Increase in urbanization leads to increase in accidents and traffic congestion in junction areas resulting in delayed travel time. In order to solve these problems, an intelligent system utilizing automatic detection and tracking system is significant. But this becomes a challenging task at road intersection areas which require a wide range of field view. For this reason, fish eye cameras are widely used in real time vehicle detection purpose to provide large area coverage and 360 degree view at junctions. However, it introduces challenges such as light glare from vehicles and street lights, shadow, non-linear distortion, scaling issues of vehicles and proper localization of small vehicles. To overcome each of these challenges, a modified YOLOv5 object detection scheme is proposed. YOLOv5 is a deep learning oriented convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detection method. The proposed scheme for detecting vehicles in fish-eye images consists of a light-weight day-night CNN classifier so that two different solutions can be implemented to address the day-night detection issues. Furthurmore, challenging instances are upsampled in the dataset for proper localization of vehicles and later on the detection model is ensembled and trained in different combination of vehicle datasets for better generalization, detection and accuracy. For testing, a real world fisheye dataset provided by the Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup organizer ISSD has been used which includes images from video clips of different fisheye cameras at junction of different cities during day and night time. Experimental results show that our proposed model has outperformed the YOLOv5 model on the dataset by 13.7% mAP @ 0.5.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OneTrack-M: A multitask approach to transformer-based MOT models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04478v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical problem in computer vision, essential for understanding how objects move and interact in videos. This field faces significant challenges such as occlusions and complex environmental dynamics, impacting model accuracy and efficiency. While traditional approaches have relied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), introducing transformers has brought substantial advancements. This work introduces OneTrack-M, a transformer-based MOT model designed to enhance tracking computational efficiency and accuracy. Our approach simplifies the typical transformer-based architecture by eliminating the need for a decoder model for object detection and tracking. Instead, the encoder alone serves as the backbone for temporal data interpretation, significantly reducing processing time and increasing inference speed. Additionally, we employ innovative data pre-processing and multitask training techniques to address occlusion and diverse objective challenges within a single set of weights. Experimental results demonstrate that OneTrack-M achieves at least 25% faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art models in the literature while maintaining or improving tracking accuracy metrics. These improvements highlight the potential of the proposed solution for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics, where rapid responses are crucial for system effectiveness.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures | None |

In this paper, we address the identification of overtake and lane change maneuvers with a novel object detection approach applied to motion profiles, a compact representation of driving video footage into a single image. To train and test our model we created an internal dataset of motion profile images obtained from a heterogeneous set of dashcam videos, manually labeled with overtake and lane change maneuvers by the ego-vehicle. In addition to a standard object-detection approach, we show how the inclusion of CoordConvolution layers further improves the model performance, in terms of mAP and F1 score, yielding state-of-the art performance when compared to other baselines from the literature. The extremely low computational requirements of the proposed solution make it especially suitable to run in device.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, the integration of AI techniques o-nboard drones is constrained by their processing capabilities. In this sense, this study evaluates the deployment of object detection models (YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s) on both resource-constrained edge devices and cloud environments. The objective is to carry out a comparative performance analysis using a representative real-time UAV image processing pipeline. Specifically, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, Orin NX, and Raspberry Pi 5 (RPI5) devices have been tested to measure their detection accuracy, inference speed, and energy consumption, and the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ). The results show that YOLOv8n surpasses YOLOv8s in its inference speed, achieving 52 FPS on the Jetson Orin NX and 65 fps with INT8 quantization. Conversely, the RPI5 failed to satisfy the real-time processing needs in spite of its suitability for low-energy consumption applications. An analysis of both the cloud-based and edge-based end-to-end processing times showed that increased communication latencies hindered real-time applications, revealing trade-offs between edge (low latency) and cloud processing (quick processing). Overall, these findings contribute to providing recommendations and optimization strategies for the deployment of AI models on UAVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript consists of 24 pages, 7 figures, and 7 tables</p></details> | None |

This study proposes an improved 6D object detection and pose estimation pipeline based on the existing 6D-VNet framework, enhanced by integrating a Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) and a High-Resolution Network (HRNet) backbone. By leveraging the strengths of HTC's multi-stage refinement process and HRNet's ability to maintain high-resolution representations, our approach significantly improves detection accuracy and pose estimation precision. Furthermore, we introduce advanced post-processing techniques and a novel model integration strategy that collectively contribute to superior performance on public and private benchmarks. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, making it a valuable contribution to the domain of 6D object detection and pose estimation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pursuing Better Decision Boundaries for Long-Tailed Object Detection via Category Information Amount](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03852v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In object detection, the instance count is typically used to define whether a dataset exhibits a long-tail distribution, implicitly assuming that models will underperform on categories with fewer instances. This assumption has led to extensive research on category bias in datasets with imbalanced instance counts. However, models still exhibit category bias even in datasets where instance counts are relatively balanced, clearly indicating that instance count alone cannot explain this phenomenon. In this work, we first introduce the concept and measurement of category information amount. We observe a significant negative correlation between category information amount and accuracy, suggesting that category information amount more accurately reflects the learning difficulty of a category. Based on this observation, we propose Information Amount-Guided Angular Margin (IGAM) Loss. The core idea of IGAM is to dynamically adjust the decision space of each category based on its information amount, thereby reducing category bias in long-tail datasets. IGAM Loss not only performs well on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as LVIS v1.0 and COCO-LT but also shows significant improvement for underrepresented categories in the non-long-tailed dataset Pascal VOC. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the potential of category information amount as a tool and the generality of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection by Balancing Domain Diversity and Invariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03835v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-domain generalization for object detection (S-DGOD) aims to transfer knowledge from a single source domain to unseen target domains. In recent years, many models have focused primarily on achieving feature invariance to enhance robustness. However, due to the inherent diversity across domains, an excessive emphasis on invariance can cause the model to overlook the actual differences between images. This overemphasis may complicate the training process and lead to a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose the Diversity Invariance Detection Model (DIDM), which focuses on the balance between the diversity of domain-specific and invariance cross domains. Recognizing that domain diversity introduces variations in domain-specific features, we introduce a Diversity Learning Module (DLM). The DLM is designed to preserve the diversity of domain-specific information with proposed feature diversity loss while limiting the category semantics in the features. In addition, to maintain domain invariance, we incorporate a Weighted Aligning Module (WAM), which aligns features without compromising feature diversity. We conducted our model on five distinct datasets, which have illustrated the superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> |  | None |

While other research on MOT dedicated to aerial videos primarily focuses on the academic aspect by developing sophisticated algorithms, there is a lack of attention to the practical aspect of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time MOT framework that integrates Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for efficient and fault-tolerant video stream processing, along with state-of-the-art deep learning models YOLOv8/YOLOv10 and BYTETRACK/BoTSORT for accurate object detection and tracking. Our work highlights the importance of not only the advanced algorithms but also the integration of these methods with scalable and distributed systems. By leveraging these technologies, our system achieves a HOTA of 48.14 and a MOTA of 43.51 on the Visdrone2019-MOT test set while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 28 FPS on a single GPU.

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix</p></details> | None |

However, existing data generation methods often struggle to effectively generate data suitable for hardware-friendly quantization, where all model layers are quantized. We analyze existing data generation methods based on batch normalization (BN) matching and identify several gaps between synthetic and real data: 1) Current generation algorithms do not optimize the entire synthetic dataset simultaneously; 2) Data augmentations applied during training are often overlooked; and 3) A distribution shift occurs in the final model layers due to the absence of BN in those layers. These gaps negatively impact ZSQ performance, particularly in hardware-friendly quantization scenarios. In this work, we propose Data Generation for Hardware-friendly quantization (DGH), a novel method that addresses these gaps. DGH jointly optimizes all generated images, regardless of the image set size or GPU memory constraints. To address data augmentation mismatches, DGH includes a preprocessing stage that mimics the augmentation process and enhances image quality by incorporating natural image priors. Finally, we propose a new distribution-stretching loss that aligns the support of the feature map distribution between real and synthetic data. This loss is applied to the model's output and can be adapted to various tasks. DGH demonstrates significant improvements in quantization performance across multiple tasks, achieving up to a 30% increase in accuracy for hardware-friendly ZSQ in both classification and object detection, often performing on par with real data.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, gastric X-rays can be taken by radiographers, thus allowing a much larger number of patients to undergo imaging. However, the diagnosis of X-ray images relies heavily on the expertise and experience of physicians, and few machine learning methods have been developed to assist in this process. We propose a novel and practical gastric cancer diagnostic support system for gastric X-ray images that will enable more people to be screened. The system is based on a general deep learning-based object detection model and incorporates two novel techniques: refined probabilistic stomach image augmentation (R-sGAIA) and hard boundary box training (HBBT). R-sGAIA enhances the probabilistic gastric fold region and provides more learning patterns for cancer detection models. HBBT is an efficient training method that improves model performance by allowing the use of unannotated negative (i.e., healthy control) samples, which are typically unusable in conventional detection models. The proposed system achieved a sensitivity (SE) for gastric cancer of 90.2\%, higher than that of an expert (85.5%). Under these conditions, two out of five candidate boxes identified by the system were cancerous (precision = 42.5%), with an image processing speed of 0.51 seconds per image. The system also outperformed methods using the same object detection model and state-of-the-art data augmentation by showing a 5.9-point improvement in the F1 score. In summary, this system efficiently identifies areas for radiologists to examine within a practical time frame, thus significantly reducing their workload.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures | None |

Whereas existing QUBO formulations are less likely to miss occluded objects than NMS, there is room for improvement because existing QUBO formulations naively consider confidence scores and pairwise scores based on spatial overlap between predictions. This study proposes new QUBO formulations that aim to distinguish whether the overlap between predictions is due to the occlusion of objects or due to redundancy in prediction, i.e., multiple predictions for a single object. The proposed QUBO formulation integrates two features into the pairwise score of the existing QUBO formulation: i) the appearance feature calculated by the image similarity metric and ii) the product of confidence scores. These features are derived from the hypothesis that redundant predictions share a similar appearance feature and (partially-) occluded objects have low confidence scores, respectively. The proposed methods demonstrate significant advancement over state-of-the-art QUBO-based suppression without a notable increase in runtime, achieving up to 4.54 points improvement in mAP and 9.89 points gain in mAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages for main contents, 3 pages for appendix, 3 pages for reference</p></details> | None |

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.).

In this work we analyze the inherent capability of one-stage object detectors to robustly operate in the presence of out-of-distribution (OoD) data. Specifically, we propose a novel detection algorithm for detecting unknown objects in image data, which leverages the features extracted by the model from each sample. Differently from other recent approaches in the literature, our proposal does not require retraining the object detector, thereby allowing for the use of pretrained models. Our proposed OoD detector exploits the application of supervised dimensionality reduction techniques to mitigate the effects of the curse of dimensionality on the features extracted by the model. Furthermore, it utilizes high-resolution feature maps to identify potential unknown objects in an unsupervised fashion. Our experiments analyze the Pareto trade-off between the performance detecting known and unknown objects resulting from different algorithmic configurations and inference confidence thresholds. We also compare the performance of our proposed algorithm to that of logits-based post-hoc OoD methods, as well as possible fusion strategies. Finally, we discuss on the competitiveness of all tested methods against state-of-the-art OoD approaches for object detection models over the recently published Unknown Object Detection benchmark. The obtained results verify that the performance of avant-garde post-hoc OoD detectors can be further improved when combined with our proposed algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 fi...</summary><p>13 figures, 4 tables, under review</p></details> | None |

STRING extends Rotary Position Encodings, a recently proposed and widely used algorithm in large language models, via a unifying theoretical framework. Importantly, STRING still provides exact translation invariance, including token coordinates of arbitrary dimensionality, whilst maintaining a low computational footprint. These properties are especially important in robotics, where efficient 3D token representation is key. We integrate STRING into Vision Transformers with RGB(-D) inputs (color plus optional depth), showing substantial gains, e.g. in open-vocabulary object detection and for robotics controllers. We complement our experiments with a rigorous mathematical analysis, proving the universality of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos of STRING-based robotics controllers can be found here: https://sites.google.com/view/string-robotics</p></details> | None |
