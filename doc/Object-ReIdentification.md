| **[Prototypical Contrastive Learning-based CLIP Fine-tuning for Object Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17218v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to adapt large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, such as contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP), to enhance the performance of object reidentification (Re-ID) across various supervision settings. Although prompt learning has enabled a recent work named CLIP-ReID to achieve promising performance, the underlying mechanisms and the necessity of prompt learning remain unclear due to the absence of semantic labels in ReID tasks. In this work, we first analyze the role prompt learning in CLIP-ReID and identify its limitations. Based on our investigations, we propose a simple yet effective approach to adapt CLIP for supervised object Re-ID. Our approach directly fine-tunes the image encoder of CLIP using a prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) loss, eliminating the need for prompt learning. Experimental results on both person and vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared to CLIP-ReID. Furthermore, we extend our PCL-based CLIP fine-tuning approach to unsupervised scenarios, where we achieve state-of-the art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AirLoc: Object-based Indoor Relocalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00954v1)** | 2023-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor relocalization is vital for both robotic tasks like autonomous exploration and civil applications such as navigation with a cell phone in a shopping mall. Some previous approaches adopt geometrical information such as key-point features or local textures to carry out indoor relocalization, but they either easily fail in an environment with visually similar scenes or require many database images. Inspired by the fact that humans often remember places by recognizing unique landmarks, we resort to objects, which are more informative than geometry elements. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective object-based indoor relocalization approach, dubbed AirLoc. To overcome the critical challenges of object reidentification and remembering object relationships, we extract object-wise appearance embedding and inter-object geometric relationships. The geometry and appearance features are integrated to generate cumulative scene features. This results in a robust, accurate, and portable indoor relocalization system, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in room-level relocalization by 9.5% of PR-AUC and 7% of accuracy. In addition to exhaustive evaluation, we also carry out real-world tests, where AirLoc shows robustness in challenges like severe occlusion, perceptual aliasing, viewpoint shift, and deformation.</p></details> |  | None |
