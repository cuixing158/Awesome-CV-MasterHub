| **[Omnidirectional Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04565v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic imagery, with its 360{\deg} field of view, offers comprehensive information to support Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in capturing spatial and temporal relationships of surrounding objects. However, most MOT algorithms are tailored for pinhole images with limited views, impairing their effectiveness in panoramic settings. Additionally, panoramic image distortions, such as resolution loss, geometric deformation, and uneven lighting, hinder direct adaptation of existing MOT methods, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose OmniTrack, an omnidirectional MOT framework that incorporates Tracklet Management to introduce temporal cues, FlexiTrack Instances for object localization and association, and the CircularStatE Module to alleviate image and geometric distortions. This integration enables tracking in large field-of-view scenarios, even under rapid sensor motion. To mitigate the lack of panoramic MOT datasets, we introduce the QuadTrack dataset--a comprehensive panoramic dataset collected by a quadruped robot, featuring diverse challenges such as wide fields of view, intense motion, and complex environments. Extensive experiments on the public JRDB dataset and the newly introduced QuadTrack benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. OmniTrack achieves a HOTA score of 26.92% on JRDB, representing an improvement of 3.43%, and further achieves 23.45% on QuadTrack, surpassing the baseline by 6.81%. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xifen523/OmniTrack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[ReynoldsFlow: Exquisite Flow Estimation via Reynolds Transport Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04500v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow is a fundamental technique for motion estimation, widely applied in video stabilization, interpolation, and object tracking. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled deep learning models to leverage optical flow as an important feature for motion analysis. However, traditional optical flow methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as brightness constancy and slow motion constraints, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenes. Deep learning-based approaches require extensive training on large domain-specific datasets, making them computationally demanding. Furthermore, optical flow is typically visualized in the HSV color space, which introduces nonlinear distortions when converted to RGB and is highly sensitive to noise, degrading motion representation accuracy. These limitations inherently constrain the performance of downstream models, potentially hindering object tracking and motion analysis tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Reynolds flow, a novel training-free flow estimation inspired by the Reynolds transport theorem, offering a principled approach to modeling complex motion dynamics. Beyond the conventional HSV-based visualization, denoted ReynoldsFlow, we introduce an alternative representation, ReynoldsFlow+, designed to improve flow visualization. We evaluate ReynoldsFlow and ReynoldsFlow+ across three video-based benchmarks: tiny object detection on UAVDB, infrared object detection on Anti-UAV, and pose estimation on GolfDB. Experimental results demonstrate that networks trained with ReynoldsFlow+ achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, exhibiting improved robustness and efficiency across all tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[A Modular Pipeline for 3D Object Tracking Using RGB Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04322v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object tracking is a key challenge of computer vision with various applications that all require different architectures. Most tracking systems have limitations such as constraining all movement to a 2D plane and they often track only one object. In this paper, we present a new modular pipeline that calculates 3D trajectories of multiple objects. It is adaptable to various settings where multiple time-synced and stationary cameras record moving objects, using off the shelf webcams. Our pipeline was tested on the Table Setting Dataset, where participants are recorded with various sensors as they set a table with tableware objects. We need to track these manipulated objects, using 6 rgb webcams. Challenges include: Detecting small objects in 9.874.699 camera frames, determining camera poses, discriminating between nearby and overlapping objects, temporary occlusions, and finally calculating a 3D trajectory using the right subset of an average of 11.12.456 pixel coordinates per 3-minute trial. We implement a robust pipeline that results in accurate trajectories with covariance of x,y,z-position as a confidence metric. It deals dynamically with appearing and disappearing objects, instantiating new Extended Kalman Filters. It scales to hundreds of table-setting trials with very little human annotation input, even with the camera poses of each trial unknown.

| **[Evaluating the Robustness of LiDAR Point Cloud Tracking Against Adversarial Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20893v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we delve into the robustness of neural network-based LiDAR point cloud tracking models under adversarial attacks, a critical aspect often overlooked in favor of performance enhancement. These models, despite incorporating advanced architectures like Transformer or Bird's Eye View (BEV), tend to neglect robustness in the face of challenges such as adversarial attacks, domain shifts, or data corruption. We instead focus on the robustness of the tracking models under the threat of adversarial attacks. We begin by establishing a unified framework for conducting adversarial attacks within the context of 3D object tracking, which allows us to thoroughly investigate both white-box and black-box attack strategies. For white-box attacks, we tailor specific loss functions to accommodate various tracking paradigms and extend existing methods such as FGSM, C\&W, and PGD to the point cloud domain. In addressing black-box attack scenarios, we introduce a novel transfer-based approach, the Target-aware Perturbation Generation (TAPG) algorithm, with the dual objectives of achieving high attack performance and maintaining low perceptibility. This method employs a heuristic strategy to enforce sparse attack constraints and utilizes random sub-vector factorization to bolster transferability. Our experimental findings reveal a significant vulnerability in advanced tracking methods when subjected to both black-box and white-box attacks, underscoring the necessity for incorporating robustness against adversarial attacks into the design of LiDAR point cloud tracking models. Notably, compared to existing methods, the TAPG also strikes an optimal balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the concealment of the perturbations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AI-Driven Relocation Tracking in Dynamic Kitchen Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01547v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As smart homes become more prevalent in daily life, the ability to understand dynamic environments is essential which is increasingly dependent on AI systems. This study focuses on developing an intelligent algorithm which can navigate a robot through a kitchen, recognizing objects, and tracking their relocation. The kitchen was chosen as the testing ground due to its dynamic nature as objects are frequently moved, rearranged and replaced. Various techniques, such as SLAM feature-based tracking and deep learning-based object detection (e.g., Faster R-CNN), are commonly used for object tracking. Additionally, methods such as optical flow analysis and 3D reconstruction have also been used to track the relocation of objects. These approaches often face challenges when it comes to problems such as lighting variations and partial occlusions, where parts of the object are hidden in some frames but visible in others. The proposed method in this study leverages the YOLOv5 architecture, initialized with pre-trained weights and subsequently fine-tuned on a custom dataset. A novel method was developed, introducing a frame-scoring algorithm which calculates a score for each object based on its location and features within all frames. This scoring approach helps to identify changes by determining the best-associated frame for each object and comparing the results in each scene, overcoming limitations seen in other methods while maintaining simplicity in design. The experimental results demonstrate an accuracy of 97.72%, a precision of 95.83% and a recall of 96.84% for this algorithm, which highlights the efficacy of the model in detecting spatial changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: 2024 14th International Conference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (ICCKE) Publisher: IEEE</p></details> | None |
| **[Tracking objects that change in appearance with phase synchrony](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02094v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or the movement of non-rigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? One plausible mechanism involves attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscience theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. Here, we describe a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MITracker: Multi-View Integration for Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20111v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view object tracking (MVOT) offers promising solutions to challenges such as occlusion and target loss, which are common in traditional single-view tracking. However, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive multi-view datasets and effective cross-view integration methods. To overcome these limitations, we compiled a Multi-View object Tracking (MVTrack) dataset of 234K high-quality annotated frames featuring 27 distinct objects across various scenes. In conjunction with this dataset, we introduce a novel MVOT method, Multi-View Integration Tracker (MITracker), to efficiently integrate multi-view object features and provide stable tracking outcomes. MITracker can track any object in video frames of arbitrary length from arbitrary viewpoints. The key advancements of our method over traditional single-view approaches come from two aspects: (1) MITracker transforms 2D image features into a 3D feature volume and compresses it into a bird's eye view (BEV) plane, facilitating inter-view information fusion; (2) we propose an attention mechanism that leverages geometric information from fused 3D feature volume to refine the tracking results at each view. MITracker outperforms existing methods on the MVTrack and GMTD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code and the new dataset will be available at https://mii-laboratory.github.io/MITracker/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://mii-laboratory.github.io/MITracker) |
| **[Open3DTrack: Towards Open-Vocabulary 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01678v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking plays a critical role in autonomous driving by enabling the real-time monitoring and prediction of multiple objects' movements. Traditional 3D tracking systems are typically constrained by predefined object categories, limiting their adaptability to novel, unseen objects in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we introduce open-vocabulary 3D tracking, which extends the scope of 3D tracking to include objects beyond predefined categories. We formulate the problem of open-vocabulary 3D tracking and introduce dataset splits designed to represent various open-vocabulary scenarios. We propose a novel approach that integrates open-vocabulary capabilities into a 3D tracking framework, allowing for generalization to unseen object classes. Our method effectively reduces the performance gap between tracking known and novel objects through strategic adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our method in diverse outdoor driving scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address open-vocabulary 3D tracking, presenting a significant advancement for autonomous systems in real-world settings. Code, trained models, and dataset splits are available publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Easy-Poly: A Easy Polyhedral Framework For 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17822v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in 3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) have predominantly relied on tracking-by-detection pipelines. However, these approaches often neglect potential enhancements in 3D detection processes, leading to high false positives (FP), missed detections (FN), and identity switches (IDS), particularly in challenging scenarios such as crowded scenes, small-object configurations, and adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, limitations in data preprocessing, association mechanisms, motion modeling, and life-cycle management hinder overall tracking robustness. To address these issues, we present Easy-Poly, a real-time, filter-based 3D MOT framework for multiple object categories. Our contributions include: (1) An Augmented Proposal Generator utilizing multi-modal data augmentation and refined SpConv operations, significantly improving mAP and NDS on nuScenes; (2) A Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO) data association algorithm that effectively manages uncertainties and occlusions through optimal assignment and multiple hypothesis handling; (3) A Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM) incorporating a confidence-weighted Kalman filter and adaptive noise covariances, enhancing MOTA and AMOTA in challenging conditions; and (4) An extended life-cycle management system with adjustive thresholds to reduce ID switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30% to 64.96% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1% to 74.5%), while also running in real-time. These findings highlight Easy-Poly's adaptability and robustness in diverse scenarios, making it a compelling choice for autonomous driving and related 3D MOT applications.

| **[Spectral-Enhanced Transformers: Leveraging Large-Scale Pretrained Models for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18748v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral object tracking using snapshot mosaic cameras is emerging as it provides enhanced spectral information alongside spatial data, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of material properties. Using transformers, which have consistently outperformed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in learning better feature representations, would be expected to be effective for Hyperspectral object tracking. However, training large transformers necessitates extensive datasets and prolonged training periods. This is particularly critical for complex tasks like object tracking, and the scarcity of large datasets in the hyperspectral domain acts as a bottleneck in achieving the full potential of powerful transformer models. This paper proposes an effective methodology that adapts large pretrained transformer-based foundation models for hyperspectral object tracking. We propose an adaptive, learnable spatial-spectral token fusion module that can be extended to any transformer-based backbone for learning inherent spatial-spectral features in hyperspectral data. Furthermore, our model incorporates a cross-modality training pipeline that facilitates effective learning across hyperspectral datasets collected with different sensor modalities. This enables the extraction of complementary knowledge from additional modalities, whether or not they are present during testing. Our proposed model also achieves superior performance with minimal training iterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 14th Workshop on Hyperspectral Imaging and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)</p></details> | None |
| **[UASTrack: A Unified Adaptive Selection Framework with Modality-Customization in Single Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18220v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal tracking is essential in single-object tracking (SOT), as different sensor types contribute unique capabilities to overcome challenges caused by variations in object appearance. However, existing unified RGB-X trackers (X represents depth, event, or thermal modality) either rely on the task-specific training strategy for individual RGB-X image pairs or fail to address the critical importance of modality-adaptive perception in real-world applications. In this work, we propose UASTrack, a unified adaptive selection framework that facilitates both model and parameter unification, as well as adaptive modality discrimination across various multi-modal tracking tasks. To achieve modality-adaptive perception in joint RGB-X pairs, we design a Discriminative Auto-Selector (DAS) capable of identifying modality labels, thereby distinguishing the data distributions of auxiliary modalities. Furthermore, we propose a Task-Customized Optimization Adapter (TCOA) tailored to various modalities in the latent space. This strategy effectively filters noise redundancy and mitigates background interference based on the specific characteristics of each modality. Extensive comparisons conducted on five benchmarks including LasHeR, GTOT, RGBT234, VisEvent, and DepthTrack, covering RGB-T, RGB-E, and RGB-D tracking scenarios, demonstrate our innovative approach achieves comparative performance by introducing only additional training parameters of 1.87M and flops of 1.95G.

| **[V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception. Our model and dataset will be made open source upon acceptance of the paper. Project website: https://lhy.xyz/projects/v-hop/</p></details> |  | None |

However, the majority of AR games still rely on pre-scanned or static scenes, and interaction mechanisms are often limited to controllers or hand-tracking. Additionally, the presence of identical objects in AR games poses challenges for conventional object tracking techniques, which often struggle to differentiate between identical objects or necessitate the installation of fixed cameras for global object movement tracking. In response to these limitations, we present a novel approach to address the tracking of identical objects in an AR scene to enrich physical-virtual interaction. Our method leverages partial scene observations captured by an AR headset, utilizing the perspective and spatial data provided by this technology. Object identities within the scene are determined through the solution of a label assignment problem using integer programming. To enhance computational efficiency, we incorporate a Voronoi diagram-based pruning method into our approach. Our implementation of this approach in a farm-to-table AR game demonstrates its satisfactory performance and robustness. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility and practicality of our method through applications in AR storytelling and a simulated gaming robot.

| **[X Modality Assisting RGBT Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17273v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing robust multi-modal feature representations is crucial for enhancing object tracking performance. In pursuit of this objective, a novel X Modality Assisting Network (X-Net) is introduced, which explores the impact of the fusion paradigm by decoupling visual object tracking into three distinct levels, thereby facilitating subsequent processing. Initially, to overcome the challenges associated with feature learning due to significant discrepancies between RGB and thermal modalities, a plug-and-play pixel-level generation module (PGM) based on knowledge distillation learning is proposed. This module effectively generates the X modality, bridging the gap between the two patterns while minimizing noise interference. Subsequently, to optimize sample feature representation and promote cross-modal interactions, a feature-level interaction module (FIM) is introduced, integrating a mixed feature interaction transformer and a spatial dimensional feature translation strategy. Finally, to address random drifting caused by missing instance features, a flexible online optimization strategy called the decision-level refinement module (DRM) is proposed, which incorporates optical flow and refinement mechanisms. The efficacy of X-Net is validated through experiments on three benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art trackers. Notably, X-Net achieves performance gains of 0.47%/1.2% in the average of precise rate and success rate, respectively. Additionally, the research content, data, and code are pledged to be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/DZSYUNNAN/XNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/DZSYUNNAN/XNet) |
| **[CRTrack: Low-Light Semi-Supervised Multi-object Tracking Based on Consistency Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16809v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking under low-light environments is prevalent in real life. Recent years have seen rapid development in the field of multi-object tracking. However, due to the lack of datasets and the high cost of annotations, multi-object tracking under low-light environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we focus on multi-object tracking under low-light conditions. To address the issues of limited data and the lack of dataset, we first constructed a low-light multi-object tracking dataset (LLMOT). This dataset comprises data from MOT17 that has been enhanced for nighttime conditions as well as multiple unannotated low-light videos. Subsequently, to tackle the high annotation costs and address the issue of image quality degradation, we propose a semi-supervised multi-object tracking method based on consistency regularization named CRTrack. First, we calibrate a consistent adaptive sampling assignment to replace the static IoU-based strategy, enabling the semi-supervised tracking method to resist noisy pseudo-bounding boxes. Then, we design a adaptive semi-supervised network update method, which effectively leverages unannotated data to enhance model performance.

Consequently, studying vision-based underwater robot navigation and control has recently gained increasing attention to counter the numerous challenges faced in underwater conditions, such as lighting variability, turbidity, camera image distortions (due to bubbles), and ROV positional disturbances (due to underwater currents). In this paper, we propose (to the best of our knowledge) a first rigorous unified benchmarking of more than seven Machine Learning (ML)-based one-shot object tracking algorithms for vision-based position locking of ROV platforms. We propose a position-locking system that processes images of an object of interest in front of which the ROV must be kept stable. Then, our proposed system uses the output result of different object tracking algorithms to automatically correct the position of the ROV against external disturbances. We conducted numerous real-world experiments using a BlueROV2 platform within an indoor pool and provided clear demonstrations of the strengths and weaknesses of each tracking approach. Finally, to help alleviate the scarcity of underwater ROV data, we release our acquired data base as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional multi-object tracking, RMOT identifies and tracks objects and incorporates textual descriptions for object class names, making the approach more intuitive. Various techniques have been proposed to address this challenging problem; however, most require the training of the entire network due to their end-to-end nature. Among these methods, iKUN has emerged as a particularly promising solution. Therefore, we further explore its pipeline and enhance its performance. In this paper, we introduce a practical module dubbed Memory-Efficient Cross-modality -- MEX. This memory-efficient technique can be directly applied to off-the-shelf trackers like iKUN, resulting in significant architectural improvements. Our method proves effective during inference on a single GPU with 4 GB of memory. Among the various benchmarks, the Refer-KITTI dataset, which offers diverse autonomous driving scenes with relevant language expressions, is particularly useful for studying this problem. Empirically, our method demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency regarding HOTA tracking scores, substantially improving memory allocation and processing speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 2024 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC), Signal Processing Track</p></details> | None |
| **[Reasoning-Enhanced Object-Centric Learning for Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15245v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-centric learning aims to break down complex visual scenes into more manageable object representations, enhancing the understanding and reasoning abilities of machine learning systems toward the physical world. Recently, slot-based video models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in segmenting and tracking objects, but they overlook the importance of the effective reasoning module. In the real world, reasoning and predictive abilities play a crucial role in human perception and object tracking; in particular, these abilities are closely related to human intuitive physics. Inspired by this, we designed a novel reasoning module called the Slot-based Time-Space Transformer with Memory buffer (STATM) to enhance the model's perception ability in complex scenes. The memory buffer primarily serves as storage for slot information from upstream modules, the Slot-based Time-Space Transformer makes predictions through slot-based spatiotemporal attention computations and fusion. Our experimental results on various datasets indicate that the STATM module can significantly enhance the capabilities of multiple state-of-the-art object-centric learning models for video. Moreover, as a predictive model, the STATM module also performs well in downstream prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. We will release our codes and data at https://github.com/intell-sci-comput/STATM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/intell-sci-comput/STATM) |

Existing 3D MOT methods based on the Tracking-by-Detection framework typically use a single motion model to track an object throughout its entire tracking process. However, objects may change their motion patterns due to variations in the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce the Interacting Multiple Model filter in IMM-MOT, which accurately fits the complex motion patterns of individual objects, overcoming the limitation of single-model tracking in existing approaches. In addition, we incorporate a Damping Window mechanism into the trajectory lifecycle management, leveraging the continuous association status of trajectories to control their creation and termination, reducing the occurrence of overlooked low-confidence true targets. Furthermore, we propose the Distance-Based Score Enhancement module, which enhances the differentiation between false positives and true positives by adjusting detection scores, thereby improving the effectiveness of the Score Filter. On the NuScenes Val dataset, IMM-MOT outperforms most other single-modal models using 3D point clouds, achieving an AMOTA of 73.8%.

| **[Adaptive Perception for Unified Visual Multi-modal Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06583v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many multi-modal trackers prioritize RGB as the dominant modality, treating other modalities as auxiliary, and fine-tuning separately various multi-modal tasks. This imbalance in modality dependence limits the ability of methods to dynamically utilize complementary information from each modality in complex scenarios, making it challenging to fully perceive the advantages of multi-modal. As a result, a unified parameter model often underperforms in various multi-modal tracking tasks. To address this issue, we propose APTrack, a novel unified tracker designed for multi-modal adaptive perception. Unlike previous methods, APTrack explores a unified representation through an equal modeling strategy. This strategy allows the model to dynamically adapt to various modalities and tasks without requiring additional fine-tuning between different tasks. Moreover, our tracker integrates an adaptive modality interaction (AMI) module that efficiently bridges cross-modality interactions by generating learnable tokens. Experiments conducted on five diverse multi-modal datasets (RGBT234, LasHeR, VisEvent, DepthTrack, and VOT-RGBD2022) demonstrate that APTrack not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art unified multi-modal trackers but also outperforms trackers designed for specific multi-modal tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Neuromorphic Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) or event cameras, inspired by biological vision, offer a promising alternative to conventional frame-based cameras. These cameras can detect changes in intensity asynchronously, even in challenging lighting conditions, with a high dynamic range and resistance to motion blur. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly used to process these event-based signals efficiently and asynchronously. Meanwhile, physics-based artificial intelligence (AI) provides a means to incorporate system-level knowledge into neural networks via physical modeling. This enhances robustness, energy efficiency, and provides symbolic explainability. In this work, we present a neuromorphic navigation framework for autonomous drone navigation. The focus is on detecting and navigating through moving gates while avoiding collisions. We use event cameras for detecting moving objects through a shallow SNN architecture in an unsupervised manner. This is combined with a lightweight energy-aware physics-guided neural network (PgNN) trained with depth inputs to predict optimal flight times, generating near-minimum energy paths.

With a robust and accurate tracking system on surgical videos, the motion dynamics and movement patterns of the hands can be captured and analyzed for many rich tasks. In this work, we propose a novel hand pose estimation model, CondPose, which improves detection and tracking accuracy by incorporating a pose prior into its prediction. We show improvements over state-of-the-art methods which provide frame-wise independent predictions, by following a temporally guided approach that effectively leverages past predictions. We collect Surgical Hands, the first dataset that provides multi-instance articulated hand pose annotations for videos. Our dataset provides over 8.1k annotated hand poses from publicly available surgical videos and bounding boxes, pose annotations, and tracking IDs to enable multi-instance tracking. When evaluated on Surgical Hands, we show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach using mean Average Precision (mAP), to measure pose estimation accuracy, and Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), to assess pose tracking performance. In comparison to a frame-wise independent strategy, we show greater performance in detecting and tracking hand poses and more substantial impact on localization accuracy. This has positive implications in generating more accurate representations of hands in the scene to be used for targeted downstream tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to IJCARS | None |
| **[OneTrack-M: A multitask approach to transformer-based MOT models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04478v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical problem in computer vision, essential for understanding how objects move and interact in videos. This field faces significant challenges such as occlusions and complex environmental dynamics, impacting model accuracy and efficiency. While traditional approaches have relied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), introducing transformers has brought substantial advancements. This work introduces OneTrack-M, a transformer-based MOT model designed to enhance tracking computational efficiency and accuracy. Our approach simplifies the typical transformer-based architecture by eliminating the need for a decoder model for object detection and tracking. Instead, the encoder alone serves as the backbone for temporal data interpretation, significantly reducing processing time and increasing inference speed. Additionally, we employ innovative data pre-processing and multitask training techniques to address occlusion and diverse objective challenges within a single set of weights. Experimental results demonstrate that OneTrack-M achieves at least 25% faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art models in the literature while maintaining or improving tracking accuracy metrics. These improvements highlight the potential of the proposed solution for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics, where rapid responses are crucial for system effectiveness.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures | None |

While other research on MOT dedicated to aerial videos primarily focuses on the academic aspect by developing sophisticated algorithms, there is a lack of attention to the practical aspect of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time MOT framework that integrates Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for efficient and fault-tolerant video stream processing, along with state-of-the-art deep learning models YOLOv8/YOLOv10 and BYTETRACK/BoTSORT for accurate object detection and tracking. Our work highlights the importance of not only the advanced algorithms but also the integration of these methods with scalable and distributed systems. By leveraging these technologies, our system achieves a HOTA of 48.14 and a MOTA of 43.51 on the Visdrone2019-MOT test set while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 28 FPS on a single GPU. Our work demonstrates the potential of big data technologies and deep learning for addressing the challenges of MOT in UAV applications.</p></details> |  | None |

We present an off-grid Fovea-Like Input Patching (FLIP) approach, which selects image input and encodes it from the beginning in an object-focused manner. While doing so, it separates locational encoding from an object-centric perceptual code. FLIP is more data-efficient and yields improved segmentation performance when masking relatively small objects in high-resolution visual scenes. On standard benchmarks such as Hypersim, KITTI-360, and OpenImages, FLIP achieves Intersection over Union (IoU) scores that approach the performance of SAM with much less compute effort. It surpasses FastSAM in all IoU measurements. We also introduce an additional semi-natural but highly intuitive dataset where FLIP outperforms SAM and FastSAM overall and particularly on relatively small objects. Seeing that FLIP is an end-to-end object-centric segmentation approach, it has high potential particularly for applications that benefit from computationally efficient, spatially highly selective object tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

INTACT combines meta-learning with adversarial curriculum training (ACT) to systematically address challenges posed by data corruption and sparsity in 3D point clouds. The meta-learning phase equips a teacher network with task-agnostic priors, enabling it to generate robust saliency maps that identify critical data regions. The ACT phase leverages these saliency maps to progressively expose a student network to increasingly complex noise patterns, ensuring targeted perturbation and improved noise resilience. INTACT's effectiveness is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on object detection, tracking, and classification benchmarks using diverse datasets, including KITTI, Argoverse, and ModelNet40. Results indicate that INTACT improves model robustness by up to 20% across all tasks, outperforming standard adversarial and curriculum training methods. This framework not only addresses the limitations of conventional training strategies but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world deployment in resource-constrained safety-critical systems. INTACT's principled integration of meta-learning and adversarial training establishes a new paradigm for noise-tolerant 3D perception in safety-critical applications. INTACT improved KITTI Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) by 9.6% (64.1% -> 75.1%) and by 12.4% under Gaussian noise (52.5% -> 73.7%). Similarly, KITTI mean Average Precision (mAP) rose from 59.8% to 69.8% (50% point drop) and 49.3% to 70.9% (Gaussian noise), highlighting the framework's ability to enhance deep learning model resilience in safety-critical object tracking scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, Radar-based solutions remain robust but often suffer from limited vertical resolution and simplistic motion models. Existing Kalman filter-based approaches also rely on fixed noise covariance, hampering adaptability when objects make sudden maneuvers. We propose Bayes-4DRTrack, a 4D Radar-based MOT framework that adopts a transformer-based motion prediction network to capture nonlinear motion dynamics and employs Bayesian approximation in both detection and prediction steps. Moreover, our two-stage data association leverages Doppler measurements to better distinguish closely spaced targets. Evaluated on the K-Radar dataset (including adverse weather scenarios), Bayes-4DRTrack demonstrates a 5.7% gain in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) over methods with traditional motion models and fixed noise covariance.

In recent years, several existing and new applications have attempted to integrate deep-learning based frameworks for this task, but most of them still heavily rely on consecutive frame based tracking embedded in their architecture or other premises that hinder generalized learning. To address this issue, we aimed to develop a new deep-learning based tracking method that relies solely on the assumption that cells can be tracked based on their spatio-temporal neighborhood, without restricting it to consecutive frames. The proposed method has the additional benefit that the motion patterns of the cells can be learned completely by the predictor without any prior assumptions, and it has the potential to handle a large number of video frames with heavy artifacts. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through biologically motivated validation strategies and compared against multiple state-of-the-art cell tracking methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Present manual and intermittent approaches to such auditing yield significant challenges, potentially leading to oversights in the monitoring process. To address these issues, we introduce a real-time, multi-modal sensing system employing 3D time-of-flight and RGB cameras, coupled with unsupervised learning techniques on edge AI devices. This enables continuous object tracking thereby enhancing efficiency in record-keeping and minimizing manual interventions. While we validate the system in a knife sanitization context within agrifood facilities, emphasizing its prowess against occlusion and low-light issues with RGB cameras, its potential spans various industrial monitoring settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Overcoming Semantic Dilution in Transformer-Based Next Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16753v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-frame prediction in videos is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving, object tracking, and motion prediction. The primary challenge in next-frame prediction lies in effectively capturing and processing both spatial and temporal information from previous video sequences. The transformer architecture, known for its prowess in handling sequence data, has made remarkable progress in this domain. However, transformer-based next-frame prediction models face notable issues: (a) The multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism requires the input embedding to be split into $N$ chunks, where $N$ is the number of heads. Each segment captures only a fraction of the original embeddings information, which distorts the representation of the embedding in the latent space, resulting in a semantic dilution problem; (b) These models predict the embeddings of the next frames rather than the frames themselves, but the loss function based on the errors of the reconstructed frames, not the predicted embeddings -- this creates a discrepancy between the training objective and the model output. We propose a Semantic Concentration Multi-Head Self-Attention (SCMHSA) architecture, which effectively mitigates semantic dilution in transformer-based next-frame prediction. Additionally, we introduce a loss function that optimizes SCMHSA in the latent space, aligning the training objective more closely with the model output. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the original transformer-based predictors.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methodologies that process video frames sequentially struggle to maintain coherent tracking of objects, especially when these objects temporarily vanish and later reappear in the footage. A critical limitation of these approaches is their inability to effectively identify crucial moments in the video, largely due to their limited grasp of temporal relationships. To overcome these obstacles, we present GraphVideoAgent, a cutting-edge system that leverages the power of graph-based object tracking in conjunction with large language model capabilities. At its core, our framework employs a dynamic graph structure that maps and monitors the evolving relationships between visual entities throughout the video sequence. This innovative approach enables more nuanced understanding of how objects interact and transform over time, facilitating improved frame selection through comprehensive contextual awareness. Our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness when tested against industry benchmarks. In evaluations on the EgoSchema dataset, GraphVideoAgent achieved a 2.2 improvement over existing methods while requiring analysis of only 8.2 frames on average. Similarly, testing on the NExT-QA benchmark yielded a 2.0 performance increase with an average frame requirement of 8.1. These results underscore the efficiency of our graph-guided methodology in enhancing both accuracy and computational performance in long-form video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, automation of the inspection task is a challenging problem as it requires precise navigation to capture images from optimal distances and viewing angles. This paper presents a novel localization pipeline that directly integrates PV module detection with UAV navigation, allowing precise positioning during inspection. Detections are used to identify the power plant structures in the image and associate these with the power plant model. We define visually recognizable anchor points for the initial association and use object tracking to discern global associations. We present three distinct methods for visual segmentation of PV modules based on traditional computer vision, deep learning, and their fusion, and we evaluate their performance in relation to the proposed localization pipeline. The presented methods were verified and evaluated using custom aerial inspection data sets, demonstrating their robustness and applicability for real-time navigation. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of the power plant model's precision on the localization methods.</p></details> | 47 pages, 22 figures | None |

By incorporating a dedicated Re-ID branch into YOLO11s, our model performs Joint Detection and Embedding (JDE), generating appearance features for each detection. The Re-ID branch is trained in a fully self-supervised setting while simultaneously training for detection, eliminating the need for costly identity-labeled datasets. The triplet loss, with hard positive and semi-hard negative mining strategies, is used for learning discriminative embeddings. Data association is enhanced with a custom tracking implementation that successfully integrates motion, appearance, and location cues. YOLO11-JDE achieves competitive results on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, surpassing existing JDE methods in terms of FPS and using up to ten times fewer parameters.

| **[CSAOT: Cooperative Multi-Agent System for Active Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13994v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Tracking is essential for many computer vision applications, such as autonomous navigation, surveillance, and robotics. Unlike Passive Object Tracking (POT), which relies on static camera viewpoints to detect and track objects across consecutive frames, Active Object Tracking (AOT) requires a controller agent to actively adjust its viewpoint to maintain visual contact with a moving target in complex environments. Existing AOT solutions are predominantly single-agent-based, which struggle in dynamic and complex scenarios due to limited information gathering and processing capabilities, often resulting in suboptimal decision-making. Alleviating these limitations necessitates the development of a multi-agent system where different agents perform distinct roles and collaborate to enhance learning and robustness in dynamic and complex environments. Although some multi-agent approaches exist for AOT, they typically rely on external auxiliary agents, which require additional devices, making them costly. In contrast, we introduce the Collaborative System for Active Object Tracking (CSAOT), a method that leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to enable multiple agents to operate on a single device, thereby improving tracking performance and reducing costs. Our approach enhances robustness against occlusions and rapid motion while optimizing camera movements to extend tracking duration. We validated the effectiveness of CSAOT on various interactive maps with dynamic and stationary obstacles.</p></details> |  | None |

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation.

In this paper, we aim to mimic this spatial cognition ability. We thus formulate the task of Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind - 3D tracking active objects using observations captured through an egocentric camera. We introduce a simple but effective approach to address this challenging problem, called Lift, Match, and Keep (LMK). LMK lifts partial 2D observations to 3D world coordinates, matches them over time using visual appearance, 3D location and interactions to form object tracks, and keeps these object tracks even when they go out-of-view of the camera. We benchmark LMK on 100 long videos from EPIC-KITCHENS. Our results demonstrate that spatial cognition is critical for correctly locating objects over short and long time scales. E.g., for one long egocentric video, we estimate the 3D location of 50 active objects. After 120 seconds, 57% of the objects are correctly localised by LMK, compared to just 33% by a recent 3D method for egocentric videos and 17% by a general 2D tracking method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 3DV 2025. 14 pages including references and appendix.

However, existing tracking datasets are primarily focused on open-air scenarios, which greatly limits the development of object tracking in underwater environments. To bridge this gap, we take a step forward by proposing the first large-scale multimodal underwater camouflaged object tracking dataset, namely UW-COT220.

Currently, tracking-by-detection (TBD) is the dominant paradigm for MOT, which performs target detection and association frame by frame. However, the association performance of TBD methods degrades in complex scenes with heavy occlusions, which hinders the application of such methods in real-world scenarios.To this end, we incorporate pseudo-depth cues to enhance the association performance and propose Pseudo-Depth SORT (PD-SORT). First, we extend the Kalman filter state vector with pseudo-depth states. Second, we introduce a novel depth volume IoU (DVIoU) by combining the conventional 2D IoU with pseudo-depth. Furthermore, we develop a quantized pseudo-depth measurement (QPDM) strategy for more robust data association. Besides, we also integrate camera motion compensation (CMC) to handle dynamic camera situations. With the above designs, PD-SORT significantly alleviates the occlusion-induced ambiguous associations and achieves leading performances on DanceTrack, MOT17, and MOT20. Note that the improvement is especially obvious on DanceTrack, where objects show complex motions, similar appearances, and frequent occlusions.

| **[Spatio-temporal Graph Learning on Adaptive Mined Key Frames for High-performance Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10129v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of multi-object tracking, the challenge of accurately capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between objects in video sequences remains a significant hurdle. This is further complicated by frequent occurrences of mutual occlusions among objects, which can lead to tracking errors and reduced performance in existing methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive key frame mining strategy that addresses the limitations of current tracking approaches. Specifically, we introduce a Key Frame Extraction (KFE) module that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively segment videos, thereby guiding the tracker to exploit the intrinsic logic of the video content. This approach allows us to capture structured spatial relationships between different objects as well as the temporal relationships of objects across frames. To tackle the issue of object occlusions, we have developed an Intra-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module. Unlike traditional graph-based methods that primarily focus on inter-frame feature fusion, our IFF module uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to facilitate information exchange between the target and surrounding objects within a frame. This innovation significantly enhances target distinguishability and mitigates tracking loss and appearance similarity due to occlusions. By combining the strengths of both long and short trajectories and considering the spatial relationships between objects, our proposed tracker achieves impressive results on the MOT17 dataset, i.e., 68.6 HOTA, 81.0 IDF1, 66.6 AssA, and 893 IDS, proving its effectiveness and accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional metrics, such as CLIP text and image scores, often fall short: text scores are limited by inadequate training data and hierarchical dependencies, while image scores fail to assess temporal consistency. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation Metric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM comprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2) primary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement via an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with weights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis. The name SST-EM reflects its focus on Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal aspects of video evaluation. SST-EM provides a comprehensive evaluation of semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness in video editing.

However, forestry operations such as harvesting, handling and measuring logs still require substantial human labor in remote environments posing significant safety risks. Progressively automating these tasks has the potential of increasing their efficiency as well as safety, but requires an accurate detection of individual logs as well as live trees and their context. Although initial approaches have been proposed for this challenging application domain, specialized data and algorithms are still too scarce to develop robust solutions. To mitigate this gap, we introduce the TimberVision dataset, consisting of more than 2k annotated RGB images containing a total of 51k trunk components including cut and lateral surfaces, thereby surpassing any existing dataset in this domain in terms of both quantity and detail by a large margin. Based on this data, we conduct a series of ablation experiments for oriented object detection and instance segmentation and evaluate the influence of multiple scene parameters on model performance. We introduce a generic framework to fuse the components detected by our models for both tasks into unified trunk representations. Furthermore, we automatically derive geometric properties and apply multi-object tracking to further enhance robustness. Our detection and tracking approach provides highly descriptive and accurate trunk representations solely from RGB image data, even under challenging environmental conditions. Our solution is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios and can be readily combined with other sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025.

Despite the impressive performance of current 3DSOT methods, evaluating them on clean datasets inadequately reflects their comprehensive performance, as the adverse weather conditions in real-world surroundings has not been considered. One of the main obstacles is the lack of adverse weather benchmarks for the evaluation of 3DSOT. To this end, this work proposes a challenging benchmark for LiDAR-based 3DSOT in adverse weather, which comprises two synthetic datasets (KITTI-A and nuScenes-A) and one real-world dataset (CADC-SOT) spanning three weather types: rain, fog, and snow. Based on this benchmark, five representative 3D trackers from different tracking frameworks conducted robustness evaluation, resulting in significant performance degradations. This prompts the question: What are the factors that cause current advanced methods to fail on such adverse weather samples? Consequently, we explore the impacts of adverse weather and answer the above question from three perspectives: 1) target distance; 2) template shape corruption; and 3) target shape corruption. Finally, based on domain randomization and contrastive learning, we designed a dual-branch tracking framework for adverse weather, named DRCT, achieving excellent performance in benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages | None |

The automatic identification of the person searched for in aerial footage could increase the autonomy of such systems, reduce the search time, and thus increase the missed person's chances of survival. In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform semantically conditioned open vocabulary object tracking that is specifically designed to cope with the limitations of UAV hardware. Our approach has several advantages. It can run with verbal descriptions of the missing person, e.g., the color of the shirt, it does not require dedicated training to execute the mission and can efficiently track a potentially moving person. Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our approach.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures | None |

To perform our study, we construct a series of autoregressive video models, called Toto. We treat videos as sequences of visual tokens and train transformer models to autoregressively predict future tokens. Our models are pre-trained on a diverse dataset of videos and images comprising over 1 trillion visual tokens. We explore different architectural, training, and inference design choices. We evaluate the learned visual representations on a range of downstream tasks including image recognition, video classification, object tracking, and robotics. Our results demonstrate that, despite minimal inductive biases, autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks. Finally, we find that scaling our video models results in similar scaling curves to those seen in language models, albeit with a different rate.

| **[TCAFF: Temporal Consistency for Robot Frame Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05210v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of collaborative robotics, the ability to communicate spatial information like planned trajectories and shared environment information is crucial. When no global position information is available (e.g., indoor or GPS-denied environments), agents must align their coordinate frames before shared spatial information can be properly expressed and interpreted. Coordinate frame alignment is particularly difficult when robots have no initial alignment and are affected by odometry drift. To this end, we develop a novel multiple hypothesis algorithm, called TCAFF, for aligning the coordinate frames of neighboring robots. TCAFF considers potential alignments from associating sparse open-set object maps and leverages temporal consistency to determine an initial alignment and correct for drift, all without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We demonstrate TCAFF being used for frame alignment in a collaborative object tracking application on a team of four robots tracking six pedestrians and show that TCAFF enables robots to achieve a tracking accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization. The code and hardware dataset are available at https://github.com/mit-acl/tcaff.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/mit-acl/tcaff) |
| **[Building a Mind Palace: Structuring Environment-Grounded Semantic Graphs for Effective Long Video Analysis with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04336v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding with Large Vision Language Models is challenged by the need to analyze temporally dispersed yet spatially concentrated key moments within limited context windows. In this work, we introduce VideoMindPalace, a new framework inspired by the "Mind Palace", which organizes critical video moments into a topologically structured semantic graph. VideoMindPalace organizes key information through (i) hand-object tracking and interaction, (ii) clustered activity zones representing specific areas of recurring activities, and (iii) environment layout mapping, allowing natural language parsing by LLMs to provide grounded insights on spatio-temporal and 3D context. In addition, we propose the Video MindPalace Benchmark (VMB), to assess human-like reasoning, including spatial localization, temporal reasoning, and layout-aware sequential understanding. Evaluated on VMB and established video QA datasets, including EgoSchema, NExT-QA, IntentQA, and the Active Memories Benchmark, VideoMindPalace demonstrates notable gains in spatio-temporal coherence and human-aligned reasoning, advancing long-form video analysis capabilities in VLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neuromorphic Optical Tracking and Imaging of Randomly Moving Targets through Strongly Scattering Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03874v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Siamese-DETR for Generic Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17875v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to detect and track the dynamic objects in different scenes is fundamental to real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving and robot navigation. However, traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is limited to tracking objects belonging to the pre-defined closed-set categories. Recently, Open-Vocabulary MOT (OVMOT) and Generic MOT (GMOT) are proposed to track interested objects beyond pre-defined categories with the given text prompt and template image. However, the expensive well pre-trained (vision-)language model and fine-grained category annotations are required to train OVMOT models. In this paper, we focus on GMOT and propose a simple but effective method, Siamese-DETR, for GMOT. Only the commonly used detection datasets (e.g., COCO) are required for training. Different from existing GMOT methods, which train a Single Object Tracking (SOT) based detector to detect interested objects and then apply a data association based MOT tracker to get the trajectories, we leverage the inherent object queries in DETR variants. Specifically: 1) The multi-scale object queries are designed based on the given template image, which are effective for detecting different scales of objects with the same category as the template image; 2) A dynamic matching training strategy is introduced to train Siamese-DETR on commonly used detection datasets, which takes full advantage of provided annotations; 3) The online tracking pipeline is simplified through a tracking-by-query manner by incorporating the tracked boxes in previous frame as additional query boxes. The complex data association is replaced with the much simpler Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Extensive experimental results show that Siamese-DETR surpasses existing MOT methods on GMOT-40 dataset by a large margin.

| **[DeTrack: In-model Latent Denoising Learning for Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02467v1)** | 2025-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous visual object tracking methods employ image-feature regression models or coordinate autoregression models for bounding box prediction. Image-feature regression methods heavily depend on matching results and do not utilize positional prior, while the autoregressive approach can only be trained using bounding boxes available in the training set, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance during testing with unseen data. Inspired by the diffusion model, denoising learning enhances the model's robustness to unseen data. Therefore, We introduce noise to bounding boxes, generating noisy boxes for training, thus enhancing model robustness on testing data. We propose a new paradigm to formulate the visual object tracking problem as a denoising learning process. However, tracking algorithms are usually asked to run in real-time, directly applying the diffusion model to object tracking would severely impair tracking speed. Therefore, we decompose the denoising learning process into every denoising block within a model, not by running the model multiple times, and thus we summarize the proposed paradigm as an in-model latent denoising learning process. Specifically, we propose a denoising Vision Transformer (ViT), which is composed of multiple denoising blocks. In the denoising block, template and search embeddings are projected into every denoising block as conditions. A denoising block is responsible for removing the noise in a predicted bounding box, and multiple stacked denoising blocks cooperate to accomplish the whole denoising process. Subsequently, we utilize image features and trajectory information to refine the denoised bounding box. Besides, we also utilize trajectory memory and visual memory to improve tracking stability. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive performance on several challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

Traditional phytoplankton monitoring methods are often complex and lack timely analysis. Therefore, deep learning algorithms offer a promising approach for automated phytoplankton monitoring. However, the lack of large-scale, high-quality training samples has become a major bottleneck in advancing phytoplankton tracking. In this paper, we propose a challenging benchmark dataset, Multiple Phytoplankton Tracking (MPT), which covers diverse background information and variations in motion during observation. The dataset includes 27 species of phytoplankton and zooplankton, 14 different backgrounds to simulate diverse and complex underwater environments, and a total of 140 videos. To enable accurate real-time observation of phytoplankton, we introduce a multi-object tracking method, Deviation-Corrected Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Tracker(DSFT), which addresses issues such as focus shifts during tracking and the loss of small target information when computing frame-to-frame similarity. Specifically, we introduce an additional feature extractor to predict the residuals of the standard feature extractor's output, and compute multi-scale frame-to-frame similarity based on features from different layers of the extractor. Extensive experiments on the MPT have demonstrated the validity of the dataset and the superiority of DSFT in tracking phytoplankton, providing an effective solution for phytoplankton monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HybridTrack: A Hybrid Approach for Robust Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01275v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has increased the need for robust and generalizable algorithms for multi-object tracking. Traditional statistical model-based tracking methods rely on predefined motion models and assumptions about system noise distributions. Although computationally efficient, they often lack adaptability to varying traffic scenarios and require extensive manual design and parameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D multi-object tracking approach for vehicles, HybridTrack, which integrates a data-driven Kalman Filter (KF) within a tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, it learns the transition residual and Kalman gain directly from data, which eliminates the need for manual motion and stochastic parameter modeling. Validated on the real-world KITTI dataset, HybridTrack achieves 82.08% HOTA accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method under different configurations, achieving the fastest processing speed of 112 FPS. Consequently, HybridTrack eliminates the dependency on scene-specific designs while improving performance and maintaining real-time efficiency.

| **[Sensitivity of Room Impulse Responses in Changing Acoustic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01206v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Changes in room acoustics, such as modifications to surface absorption or the insertion of a scattering object, significantly impact measured room impulse responses (RIRs). These changes can affect the performance of systems used in echo cancellation and active acoustics and support tasks such as navigation and object tracking. Recognizing and quantifying such changes is, therefore, critical for advancing technologies based on room acoustics. This study introduces a method for analyzing acoustic environment changes by evaluating the similarity of consecutively recorded RIRs. Short-time coherence is employed to characterize modifications, including changes in wall absorption or the presence of a moving person in the room. A sensitivity rating is further used to quantify the magnitude of these changes. The results clearly differentiate between types of modifications -- atmospheric variation, changes in absorption, and human presence. The methods described provide a novel approach to analyzing and interpreting room acoustics, emphasizing RIR similarity and extracting information from temporal and spectral signal properties.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TOPIC: A Parallel Association Paradigm for Multi-Object Tracking under Complex Motions and Diverse Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11157v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video data and algorithms have been driving advances in multi-object tracking (MOT). While existing MOT datasets focus on occlusion and appearance similarity, complex motion patterns are widespread yet overlooked. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset called BEE24 to highlight complex motions. Identity association algorithms have long been the focus of MOT research. Existing trackers can be categorized into two association paradigms: single-feature paradigm (based on either motion or appearance feature) and serial paradigm (one feature serves as secondary while the other is primary). However, these paradigms are incapable of fully utilizing different features. In this paper, we propose a parallel paradigm and present the Two rOund Parallel matchIng meChanism (TOPIC) to implement it. The TOPIC leverages both motion and appearance features and can adaptively select the preferable one as the assignment metric based on motion level. Moreover, we provide an Attention-based Appearance Reconstruction Module (AARM) to reconstruct appearance feature embeddings, thus enhancing the representation of appearance features. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets and BEE24. Moreover, BEE24 challenges existing trackers to track multiple similar-appearing small objects with complex motions over long periods, which is critical in real-world applications such as beekeeping and drone swarm surveillance. Notably, our proposed parallel paradigm surpasses the performance of existing association paradigms by a large margin, e.g., reducing false negatives by 6% to 81% compared to the single-feature association paradigm. The introduced dataset and association paradigm in this work offer a fresh perspective for advancing the MOT field.

They typically capture context by incorporating multiple video frames. However, these naive frame-context methods fail to consider the importance of each patch within a reference frame, making them susceptible to noise and redundant tokens, which deteriorates tracking performance. To address this challenge, we propose a new token context-aware tracking pipeline named LMTrack, designed to automatically learn high-quality reference tokens for efficient visual tracking. Embracing the principle of Less is More, the core idea of LMTrack is to analyze the importance distribution of all reference tokens, where important tokens are collected, continually attended to, and updated. Specifically, a novel Token Context Memory module is designed to dynamically collect high-quality spatio-temporal information of a target in an autoregressive manner, eliminating redundant background tokens from the reference frames. Furthermore, an effective Unidirectional Token Attention mechanism is designed to establish dependencies between reference tokens and search frame, enabling robust cross-frame association and target localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our tracker, achieving state-of-the-art results on tracking benchmarks such as GOT-10K, TrackingNet, and LaSOT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

As segmentation foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) begin to emerge, zero-shot segmentation requires only minimal human participation obtaining high-quality object masks. We introduce a HoloLens-Object-Labeling (HOLa) Unity and Python application based on the SAM-Track algorithm that offers fully automatic single object annotation for HoloLens 2 while requiring minimal human participation. HOLa does not have to be adjusted to a specific image appearance and could thus alleviate AR research in any application field. We evaluate HOLa for different degrees of image complexity in open liver surgery and in medical phantom experiments. Using HOLa for image annotation can increase the labeling speed by more than 500 times while providing Dice scores between 0.875 and 0.982, which are comparable to human annotators.

It consolidates five SOT tasks (RGB-based, RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-Event, RGB-Language Tracking) into a unified model trained in a single session. Due to the distinct nature of the data, current methods typically design individual architectures and train separate models for each task. This fragmentation results in redundant training processes, repetitive technological innovations, and limited cross-modal knowledge sharing. In contrast, SUTrack demonstrates that a single model with a unified input representation can effectively handle various common SOT tasks, eliminating the need for task-specific designs and separate training sessions. Additionally, we introduce a task-recognition auxiliary training strategy and a soft token type embedding to further enhance SUTrack's performance with minimal overhead. Experiments show that SUTrack outperforms previous task-specific counterparts across 11 datasets spanning five SOT tasks. Moreover, we provide a range of models catering edge devices as well as high-performance GPUs, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. We hope SUTrack could serve as a strong foundation for further compelling research into unified tracking models.

Its task form is to guide the tracker to track objects that match the language description. Current research mainly focuses on referring multi-object tracking under single-view, which refers to a view sequence or multiple unrelated view sequences. However, in the single-view, some appearances of objects are easily invisible, resulting in incorrect matching of objects with the language description. In this work, we propose a new task, called Cross-view Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CRMOT). It introduces the cross-view to obtain the appearances of objects from multiple views, avoiding the problem of the invisible appearances of objects in RMOT task. CRMOT is a more challenging task of accurately tracking the objects that match the language description and maintaining the identity consistency of objects in each cross-view. To advance CRMOT task, we construct a cross-view referring multi-object tracking benchmark based on CAMPUS and DIVOTrack datasets, named CRTrack. Specifically, it provides 13 different scenes and 221 language descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end cross-view referring multi-object tracking method, named CRTracker.

However, in the task of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), leveraging the power of Transformers remains relatively unexplored. Among the pioneering efforts in this domain, TransCenter, a Transformer-based MOT architecture with dense object queries, demonstrated exceptional tracking capabilities while maintaining reasonable runtime. Nonetheless, one critical aspect in MOT, track displacement estimation, presents room for enhancement to further reduce association errors. In response to this challenge, our paper introduces a novel improvement to TransCenter. We propose a post-processing mechanism grounded in the Track-by-Detection paradigm, aiming to refine the track displacement estimation. Our approach involves the integration of a carefully designed Kalman filter, which incorporates Transformer outputs into measurement error estimation, and the use of an embedding network for target re-identification. This combined strategy yields substantial improvement in the accuracy and robustness of the tracking process. We validate our contributions through comprehensive experiments on the MOTChallenge datasets MOT17 and MOT20, where our proposed approach outperforms other Transformer-based trackers.

For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Springer International Journal of Computer Vision</p></details> | None |
| **[Exploiting Multimodal Spatial-temporal Patterns for Video Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15691v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal tracking has garnered widespread attention as a result of its ability to effectively address the inherent limitations of traditional RGB tracking. However, existing multimodal trackers mainly focus on the fusion and enhancement of spatial features or merely leverage the sparse temporal relationships between video frames. These approaches do not fully exploit the temporal correlations in multimodal videos, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes and motion information of targets in complex scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose a unified multimodal spatial-temporal tracking approach named STTrack. In contrast to previous paradigms that solely relied on updating reference information, we introduced a temporal state generator (TSG) that continuously generates a sequence of tokens containing multimodal temporal information. These temporal information tokens are used to guide the localization of the target in the next time state, establish long-range contextual relationships between video frames, and capture the temporal trajectory of the target. Furthermore, at the spatial level, we introduced the mamba fusion and background suppression interactive (BSI) modules. These modules establish a dual-stage mechanism for coordinating information interaction and fusion between modalities. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets illustrate that STTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multimodal tracking scenarios.

However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, agro-food environments pose difficulties for robots due to high variation and occlusions. In the presence of these challenges, accurate world models, with information about object location, shape, and properties, are crucial for robots to perform tasks accurately. Building such models is challenging due to the complex and unique nature of agro-food environments, and errors in the model can lead to task execution issues. In this paper, MinkSORT, a novel method for generating tracking features using a 3D sparse convolutional network in a deepSORT-like approach, is proposed to improve the accuracy of world models in agro-food environments. MinkSORT was evaluated using real-world data collected in a tomato greenhouse, where it significantly improved the performance of a baseline model that tracks tomato positions in 3D using a Kalman filter and Mahalanobis distance. MinkSORT improved the HOTA from 42.8% to 44.77%, the association accuracy from 32.55% to 35.55%, and the MOTA from 57.63% to 58.81%. Different contrastive loss functions for training MinkSORT were also evaluated, and it was demonstrated that it leads to improved performance in terms of three separate precision and recall detection outcomes. The proposed method improves world model accuracy, enabling robots to perform tasks such as harvesting and plant maintenance with greater efficiency and accuracy, which is essential for meeting the growing demand for food in a sustainable manner.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Joint Perception and Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14088v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception and prediction modules are critical components of autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to navigate safely through complex environments. The perception module is responsible for perceiving the environment, including static and dynamic objects, while the prediction module is responsible for predicting the future behavior of these objects. These modules are typically divided into three tasks: object detection, object tracking, and motion prediction. Traditionally, these tasks are developed and optimized independently, with outputs passed sequentially from one to the next. However, this approach has significant limitations: computational resources are not shared across tasks, the lack of joint optimization can amplify errors as they propagate throughout the pipeline, and uncertainty is rarely propagated between modules, resulting in significant information loss. To address these challenges, the joint perception and prediction paradigm has emerged, integrating perception and prediction into a unified model through multi-task learning. This strategy not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also enables the three tasks to have direct access to raw sensor data, allowing richer and more nuanced environmental interpretations. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of joint perception and prediction for autonomous driving. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes approaches based on input representation, scene context modeling, and output representation, highlighting their contributions and limitations. Additionally, we present a qualitative analysis and quantitative comparison of existing methods.

| **[MOT-DETR: 3D Single Shot Detection and Tracking with Transformers to build 3D representations for Agro-Food Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15674v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the current demand for automation in the agro-food industry, accurately detecting and localizing relevant objects in 3D is essential for successful robotic operations. However, this is a challenge due the presence of occlusions. Multi-view perception approaches allow robots to overcome occlusions, but a tracking component is needed to associate the objects detected by the robot over multiple viewpoints. Most multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are designed for high frame rate sequences and struggle with the occlusions generated by robots' motions and 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce MOT-DETR, a novel approach to detect and track objects in 3D over time using a combination of convolutional networks and transformers. Our method processes 2D and 3D data, and employs a transformer architecture to perform data fusion. We show that MOT-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art multi-object tracking methods. Furthermore, we prove that MOT-DETR can leverage 3D data to deal with long-term occlusions and large frame-to-frame distances better than state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show how our method is resilient to camera pose noise that can affect the accuracy of point clouds.

However, the context length constructed by existing work is limited, only considering object information from adjacent frames or video clips, leading to insufficient utilization of contextual information. To address this issue, we propose MambaLCT, which constructs and utilizes target variation cues from the first frame to the current frame for robust tracking. First, a novel unidirectional Context Mamba module is designed to scan frame features along the temporal dimension, gathering target change cues throughout the entire sequence. Specifically, target-related information in frame features is compressed into a hidden state space through selective scanning mechanism. The target information across the entire video is continuously aggregated into target variation cues. Next, we inject the target change cues into the attention mechanism, providing temporal information for modeling the relationship between the template and search frames. The advantage of MambaLCT is its ability to continuously extend the length of the context, capturing complete target change cues, which enhances the stability and robustness of the tracker. Extensive experiments show that long-term context information enhances the model's ability to perceive targets in complex scenarios. MambaLCT achieves new SOTA performance on six benchmarks while maintaining real-time running speeds.</p></details> |  | None |

Optical flow serves as a fundamental building block for various video-related tasks, such as video restoration, motion estimation, video stabilization, object tracking, action recognition, and video generation. While current state-of-the-art methods prioritize accuracy, they often overlook constraints regarding speed and memory usage. Existing light models typically focus on reducing size but still exhibit high latency, compromise significantly on quality, or are optimized for high-performance GPUs, resulting in sub-optimal performance on mobile devices. This study aims to develop a mobile-optimized optical flow model by proposing a novel mobile device-compatible architecture, as well as enhancements to the training pipeline, which optimize the model for reduced weight, low memory utilization, and increased speed while maintaining minimal error. Our approach demonstrates superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art lightweight models on the challenging KITTI and Sintel benchmarks. Furthermore, it attains a significantly accelerated inference speed, thereby yielding real-time operational efficiency on the iPhone 8, while surpassing real-time performance levels on more advanced mobile devices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tell Me What to Track: Infusing Robust Language Guidance for Enhanced Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12561v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an emerging cross-modal task that aims to localize an arbitrary number of targets based on a language expression and continuously track them in a video. This intricate task involves reasoning on multi-modal data and precise target localization with temporal association. However, prior studies overlook the imbalanced data distribution between newborn targets and existing targets due to the nature of the task. In addition, they only indirectly fuse multi-modal features, struggling to deliver clear guidance on newborn target detection. To solve the above issues, we conduct a collaborative matching strategy to alleviate the impact of the imbalance, boosting the ability to detect newborn targets while maintaining tracking performance. In the encoder, we integrate and enhance the cross-modal and multi-scale fusion, overcoming the bottlenecks in previous work, where limited multi-modal information is shared and interacted between feature maps. In the decoder, we also develop a referring-infused adaptation that provides explicit referring guidance through the query tokens. The experiments showcase the superior performance of our model (+3.42%) compared to prior works, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Enhanced Contextual Information for Video-Level Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11023v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual information at the video level has become increasingly crucial for visual object tracking. However, existing methods typically use only a few tokens to convey this information, which can lead to information loss and limit their ability to fully capture the context. To address this issue, we propose a new video-level visual object tracking framework called MCITrack. It leverages Mamba's hidden states to continuously record and transmit extensive contextual information throughout the video stream, resulting in more robust object tracking. The core component of MCITrack is the Contextual Information Fusion module, which consists of the mamba layer and the cross-attention layer. The mamba layer stores historical contextual information, while the cross-attention layer integrates this information into the current visual features of each backbone block. This module enhances the model's ability to capture and utilize contextual information at multiple levels through deep integration with the backbone. Experiments demonstrate that MCITrack achieves competitive performance across numerous benchmarks. For instance, it gets 76.6% AUC on LaSOT and 80.0% AO on GOT-10k, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance.

Existing multi-object tracking algorithms generally focus on single-modality scenes, and overlook the complementary characteristics of tiny objects captured by multiple remote sensors. To enhance tracking performance by integrating complementary information from multiple sources, we propose a novel framework called {HGT-Track (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer based Multi-Tiny-Object Tracking)}. Specifically, we first employ a Transformer-based encoder to embed images from different modalities. Subsequently, we utilize Heterogeneous Graph Transformer to aggregate spatial and temporal information from multiple modalities to generate detection and tracking features. Additionally, we introduce a target re-detection module (ReDet) to ensure tracklet continuity by maintaining consistency across different modalities. Furthermore, this paper introduces the first benchmark VT-Tiny-MOT (Visible-Thermal Tiny Multi-Object Tracking) for RGB-T fused multiple tiny object tracking. Extensive experiments are conducted on VT-Tiny-MOT, and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of MOTA (Multiple-Object Tracking Accuracy) and ID-F1 score.

A critical challenge is accurately identifying and tracking sounding objects related to the question along the timeline. In this paper, we present a new Patch-level Sounding Object Tracking (PSOT) method. It begins with a Motion-driven Key Patch Tracking (M-KPT) module, which relies on visual motion information to identify salient visual patches with significant movements that are more likely to relate to sounding objects and questions. We measure the patch-wise motion intensity map between neighboring video frames and utilize it to construct and guide a motion-driven graph network. Meanwhile, we design a Sound-driven KPT (S-KPT) module to explicitly track sounding patches. This module also involves a graph network, with the adjacency matrix regularized by the audio-visual correspondence map. The M-KPT and S-KPT modules are performed in parallel for each temporal segment, allowing balanced tracking of salient and sounding objects. Based on the tracked patches, we further propose a Question-driven KPT (Q-KPT) module to retain patches highly relevant to the question, ensuring the model focuses on the most informative clues. The audio-visual-question features are updated during the processing of these modules, which are then aggregated for final answer prediction. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive performance even compared to recent large-scale pretraining-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Tracking-by-attention, however, entangles detection and tracking queries in one embedding for both the detection and tracking task, which is sub-optimal. Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm and detect objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association. These methods, however, do not leverage synergies between the detection and association task. Combining the strengths of both paradigms, we introduce ADA-Track++, a novel end-to-end framework for 3D MOT from multi-view cameras. We introduce a learnable data association module based on edge-augmented cross-attention, leveraging appearance and geometric features. We also propose an auxiliary token in this attention-based association module, which helps mitigate disproportionately high attention to incorrect association targets caused by attention normalization. Furthermore, we integrate this association module into the decoder layer of a DETR-based 3D detector, enabling simultaneous DETR-like query-to-image cross-attention for detection and query-to-query cross-attention for data association. By stacking these decoder layers, queries are refined for the detection and association task alternately, effectively harnessing the task dependencies. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to the two previous paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

The VOT technology could be applied in various scenarios, processing data of diverse modalities such as RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud. Besides, since no one sensor could handle all the dynamic and varying environments, multi-modal VOT is also investigated. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent progress of both single-modal and multi-modal VOT, especially the deep learning methods. Specifically, we first review three types of mainstream single-modal VOT, including RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud tracking. In particular, we conclude four widely-used single-modal frameworks, abstracting their schemas and categorizing the existing inheritors. Then we summarize four kinds of multi-modal VOT, including RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-LiDAR and RGB-Language. Moreover, the comparison results in plenty of VOT benchmarks of the discussed modalities are presented. Finally, we provide recommendations and insightful observations, inspiring the future development of this fast-growing literature.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often struggle with sparse and incomplete point cloud scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal-guided Virtual Cues Projection (MVCP) scheme that generates virtual cues to enrich sparse point clouds. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced tracker MVCTrack based on the generated virtual cues. Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Among tactile-dependent skills, tactile-based object tracking serves as the cornerstone for many tasks, including manipulation, in-hand manipulation, and 3D reconstruction. In this work, we introduce NormalFlow, a fast, robust, and real-time tactile-based 6DoF tracking algorithm. Leveraging the precise surface normal estimation of vision-based tactile sensors, NormalFlow determines object movements by minimizing discrepancies between the tactile-derived surface normals. Our results show that NormalFlow consistently outperforms competitive baselines and can track low-texture objects like table surfaces. For long-horizon tracking, we demonstrate when rolling the sensor around a bead for 360 degrees, NormalFlow maintains a rotational tracking error of 2.5 degrees. Additionally, we present state-of-the-art tactile-based 3D reconstruction results, showcasing the high accuracy of NormalFlow. We believe NormalFlow unlocks new possibilities for high-precision perception and manipulation tasks that involve interacting with objects using hands.

This is because UAV-MOT faces both local object motion and global camera motion. Motion blur also increases the difficulty of detecting large moving objects. Previous UAV motion modeling approaches either focus only on local motion or ignore motion blurring effects, thus limiting their tracking performance and speed. To address these issues, we propose the Motion Mamba Module, which explores both local and global motion features through cross-correlation and bi-directional Mamba Modules for better motion modeling. To address the detection difficulties caused by motion blur, we also design motion margin loss to effectively improve the detection accuracy of motion blurred objects. Based on the Motion Mamba module and motion margin loss, our proposed MM-Tracker surpasses the state-of-the-art in two widely open-source UAV-MOT datasets.

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we aim to reveal the broader capabilities, advantages, and potential challenges of this architecture across various specifically designed scenarios, including a pedestrian tracking dataset. We also conduct an ablation study comparing the model against its restricted variants and the widely used Kalman filter.

Moreover, the introduction of high quality legged robots into workplaces highlighted the crucial role of a robust, fully autonomous safety solution for robots to be viable in shared spaces or in co-existence with humans. This article establishes for the first time ever an innovative Detect-Track-and-Avoid Architecture (DTAA) to enhance safety and overall mission performance. The proposed novel architectyre has the merit ot integrating object detection using YOLOv8, utilizing Ultralytics embedded object tracking, and state estimation of tracked objects through Kalman filters. Moreover, a novel heuristic clustering is employed to facilitate active avoidance of multiple closely positioned objects with similar velocities, creating sets of unsafe spaces for the Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) to navigate around. The NMPC identifies the most hazardous unsafe space, considering not only their current positions but also their predicted future locations. In the sequel, the NMPC calculates maneuvers to guide the robot along a path planned by D$^{*}_{+}$ towards its intended destination, while maintaining a safe distance to all identified obstacles. The efficacy of the novelly suggested DTAA framework is being validated by Real-life experiments featuring a Boston Dynamics Spot robot that demonstrates the robot's capability to consistently maintain a safe distance from humans in dynamic subterranean, urban indoor, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-time tracking in complex maritime environments is challenging due to dynamic camera movement, low visibility, and scale variation. Typically, object detection methods combined with filtering techniques are commonly used for tracking, but they often lack robustness, particularly in the presence of camera motion and missed detections. Although advanced tracking methods have been proposed recently, their application in maritime scenarios is limited. To address this gap, this study proposes a vision-guided object-tracking framework for USVs, integrating state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with low-level control systems to enable precise tracking in dynamic maritime environments. We benchmarked the performance of seven distinct trackers, developed using advanced deep learning techniques such as Siamese Networks and Transformers, by evaluating them on both simulated and real-world maritime datasets. In addition, we evaluated the robustness of various control algorithms in conjunction with these tracking systems. The proposed framework was validated through simulations and real-world sea experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling dynamic maritime conditions. The results show that SeqTrack, a Transformer-based tracker, performed best in adverse conditions, such as dust storms. Among the control algorithms evaluated, the linear quadratic regulator controller (LQR) demonstrated the most robust and smooth control, allowing for stable tracking of the USV.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

While pedestrian tracking has advanced with Tracking-by-Detection MOT, team sports like basketball pose unique challenges. These challenges include players' unpredictable movements, frequent close interactions, and visual similarities that complicate pose labeling and lead to significant occlusions, frequent ID switches, and high manual annotation costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pose-based virtual marker (VM) MOT method for team sports, named Sports-vmTracking. This method builds on the vmTracking approach developed for multi-animal tracking with active learning. First, we constructed a 3x3 basketball pose dataset for VMs and applied active learning to enhance model performance in generating VMs. Then, we overlaid the VMs on video to identify players, extract their poses with unique IDs, and convert these into bounding boxes for comparison with automated MOT methods. Using our 3x3 basketball dataset, we demonstrated that our VM configuration has been highly effective, and reduced the need for manual corrections and labeling during pose model training while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach achieved an average HOTA score of 72.3%, over 10 points higher than other state-of-the-art methods without VM, and resulted in 0 ID switches. Beyond improving performance in handling occlusions and minimizing ID switches, our framework could substantially increase the time and cost efficiency compared to traditional manual annotation.</p></details> |  | None |

Most traditional multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) detection and tracking methods rely on 2D object detection, single-view multi-object tracking (MOT), and cross-view re-identification (ReID) techniques, without properly handling important 3D information by multi-view image aggregation. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection and tracking framework, named BEV-SUSHI, which first aggregates multi-view images with necessary camera calibration parameters to obtain 3D object detections in bird's-eye view (BEV). Then, we introduce hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to track these 3D detections in BEV for MTMC tracking results. Unlike existing methods, BEV-SUSHI has impressive generalizability across different scenes and diverse camera settings, with exceptional capability for long-term association handling. As a result, our proposed BEV-SUSHI establishes the new state-of-the-art on the AICity'24 dataset with 81.22 HOTA, and 95.6 IDF1 on the WildTrack dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR datasets show we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[A Certifiable Algorithm for Simultaneous Shape Estimation and Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16837v3)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications from manipulation to autonomous vehicles rely on robust and general object tracking to safely perform tasks in dynamic environments. We propose the first certifiably optimal category-level approach for simultaneous shape estimation and pose tracking of an object of known category (e.g. a car). Our approach uses 3D semantic keypoint measurements extracted from an RGB-D image sequence, and phrases the estimation as a fixed-lag smoothing problem. Temporal constraints enforce the object's rigidity (fixed shape) and smooth motion according to a constant-twist motion model. The solutions to this problem are the estimates of the object's state (poses, velocities) and shape (paramaterized according to the active shape model) over the smoothing horizon. Our key contribution is to show that despite the non-convexity of the fixed-lag smoothing problem, we can solve it to certifiable optimality using a small-size semidefinite relaxation. We also present a fast outlier rejection scheme that filters out incorrect keypoint detections with shape and time compatibility tests, and wrap our certifiable solver in a graduated non-convexity scheme. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic and real data, showcasing its performance in a table-top manipulation scenario and a drone-based vehicle tracking application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE RA-L. 11 pages, 6 figures (with appendix).

| **[Camouflaged Object Tracking: A Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13877v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tracking has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by the availability of large-scale training datasets that have enabled the development of highly accurate and robust algorithms. While significant progress has been made in tracking general objects, research on more challenging scenarios, such as tracking camouflaged objects, remains limited. Camouflaged objects, which blend seamlessly with their surroundings or other objects, present unique challenges for detection and tracking in complex environments. This challenge is particularly critical in applications such as military, security, agriculture, and marine monitoring, where precise tracking of camouflaged objects is essential. To address this gap, we introduce the Camouflaged Object Tracking Dataset (COTD), a specialized benchmark designed specifically for evaluating camouflaged object tracking methods. The COTD dataset comprises 200 sequences and approximately 80,000 frames, each annotated with detailed bounding boxes. Our evaluation of 20 existing tracking algorithms reveals significant deficiencies in their performance with camouflaged objects. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework, HiPTrack-MLS, which demonstrates promising results in improving tracking performance for camouflaged objects. COTD and code are avialable at https://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS) |

In this paper, we introduce Medical SAM 2 (MedSAM-2), a generalized auto-tracking model for universal 2D and 3D medical image segmentation. The core concept is to leverage the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) pipeline to treat all 2D and 3D medical segmentation tasks as a video object tracking problem. To put it into practice, we propose a novel \emph{self-sorting memory bank} mechanism that dynamically selects informative embeddings based on confidence and dissimilarity, regardless of temporal order. This mechanism not only significantly improves performance in 3D medical image segmentation but also unlocks a \emph{One-Prompt Segmentation} capability for 2D images, allowing segmentation across multiple images from a single prompt without temporal relationships. We evaluated MedSAM-2 on five 2D tasks and nine 3D tasks, including white blood cells, optic cups, retinal vessels, mandibles, coronary arteries, kidney tumors, liver tumors, breast cancer, nasopharynx cancer, vestibular schwannoma, mediastinal lymph nodules, cerebral artery, inferior alveolar nerve, and abdominal organs, comparing it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in task-tailored, general and interactive segmentation settings. Our findings demonstrate that MedSAM-2 surpasses a wide range of existing models and updates new SOTA on several benchmarks.

| **[Distillation of Diffusion Features for Semantic Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03512v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic correspondence, the task of determining relationships between different parts of images, underpins various applications including 3D reconstruction, image-to-image translation, object tracking, and visual place recognition. Recent studies have begun to explore representations learned in large generative image models for semantic correspondence, demonstrating promising results. Building on this progress, current state-of-the-art methods rely on combining multiple large models, resulting in high computational demands and reduced efficiency. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a more computationally efficient approach. We propose a novel knowledge distillation technique to overcome the problem of reduced efficiency. We show how to use two large vision foundation models and distill the capabilities of these complementary models into one smaller model that maintains high accuracy at reduced computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by incorporating 3D data, we are able to further improve performance, without the need for human-annotated correspondences. Overall, our empirical results demonstrate that our distilled model with 3D data augmentation achieves performance superior to current state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational load and enhancing practicality for real-world applications, such as semantic video correspondence.

While already achieving top performance on many benchmarks, it was the recent release of SAM2 that placed memory-based trackers into focus of the visual object tracking community. Nevertheless, modern trackers still struggle in the presence of distractors. We argue that a more sophisticated memory model is required, and propose a new distractor-aware memory model for SAM2 and an introspection-based update strategy that jointly addresses the segmentation accuracy as well as tracking robustness. The resulting tracker is denoted as SAM2.1++. We also propose a new distractor-distilled DiDi dataset to study the distractor problem better. SAM2.1++ outperforms SAM2.1 and related SAM memory extensions on seven benchmarks and sets a solid new state-of-the-art on six of them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Specifically, GSOT3D offers 620 sequences with 123K frames, and covers a wide selection of 54 object categories. Each sequence is offered with multiple modalities, including the point cloud (PC), RGB image, and depth. This allows GSOT3D to support various 3D tracking tasks, such as single-modal 3D SOT on PC and multi-modal 3D SOT on RGB-PC or RGB-D, and thus greatly broadens research directions for 3D object tracking. To provide highquality per-frame 3D annotations, all sequences are labeled manually with multiple rounds of meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, GSOT3D is the largest benchmark dedicated to various generic 3D object tracking tasks. To understand how existing 3D trackers perform and to provide comparisons for future research on GSOT3D, we assess eight representative point cloud-based tracking models. Our evaluation results exhibit that these models heavily degrade on GSOT3D, and more efforts are required for robust and generic 3D object tracking. Besides, to encourage future research, we present a simple yet effective generic 3D tracker, named PROT3D, that localizes the target object via a progressive spatial-temporal network and outperforms all current solutions by a large margin. By releasing GSOT3D, we expect to advance further 3D tracking in future research and applications. Our benchmark and model as well as the evaluation results will be publicly released at our webpage https://github.com/ailovejinx/GSOT3D.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/ailovejinx/GSOT3D) |

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A2VIS: Amodal-Aware Approach to Video Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01147v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling occlusion remains a significant challenge for video instance-level tasks like Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Amodal-Aware Video Instance Segmentation (A2VIS), which incorporates amodal representations to achieve a reliable and comprehensive understanding of both visible and occluded parts of objects in a video. The key intuition is that awareness of amodal segmentation through spatiotemporal dimension enables a stable stream of object information. In scenarios where objects are partially or completely hidden from view, amodal segmentation offers more consistency and less dramatic changes along the temporal axis compared to visible segmentation. Hence, both amodal and visible information from all clips can be integrated into one global instance prototype. To effectively address the challenge of video amodal segmentation, we introduce the spatiotemporal-prior Amodal Mask Head, which leverages visible information intra clips while extracting amodal characteristics inter clips. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that A2VIS excels in both MOT and VIS tasks in identifying and tracking object instances with a keen understanding of their full shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

While existing methods have made strides in vision-language alignment, they often overlook the importance of robust video object tracking, where inconsistent mask tracks can disrupt vision-language alignment, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we present Selection by Object Language Alignment (SOLA), a novel framework that reformulates RVOS into two sub-problems, track generation and track selection. In track generation, we leverage a vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), which generates consistent mask tracks across frames, producing reliable candidates for both foreground and background objects. For track selection, we propose a light yet effective selection module that aligns visual and textual features while modeling object appearance and motion within video sequences. This design enables precise motion modeling and alignment of the vision language. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MeViS dataset and demonstrates superior results in zero-shot settings on the Ref-Youtube-VOS and Ref-DAVIS datasets. Furthermore, SOLA exhibits strong generalization and robustness in corrupted settings, such as those with added Gaussian noise or motion blur.

Within ITS, answering complex, real-time queries like "How many red cars passed in the last 10 minutes?" or "Was there an incident between 3:00 PM and 3:05 PM?" enhances situational awareness and decision-making. Despite progress in vision-language models, VideoQA remains challenging, especially in dynamic environments involving multiple objects and intricate spatiotemporal relationships. This study evaluates state-of-the-art VideoQA models using non-benchmark synthetic and real-world traffic sequences. The framework leverages GPT-4o to assess accuracy, relevance, and consistency across basic detection, temporal reasoning, and decomposition queries. VideoLLaMA-2 excelled with 57% accuracy, particularly in compositional reasoning and consistent answers. However, all models, including VideoLLaMA-2, faced limitations in multi-object tracking, temporal coherence, and complex scene interpretation, highlighting gaps in current architectures. These findings underscore VideoQA's potential in traffic monitoring but also emphasize the need for improvements in multi-object tracking, temporal reasoning, and compositional capabilities. Enhancing these areas could make VideoQA indispensable for incident detection, traffic flow management, and responsive urban planning.

It enables precise identification, monitoring, and spatiotemporal analysis of objects across sequential frames, providing insights into dynamic behaviors. In cell biology, object tracking is vital for uncovering cellular mechanisms, such as migration, interactions, and responses to drugs or pathogens. These insights drive breakthroughs in understanding disease progression and therapeutic interventions. Over time, object tracking methods have evolved from traditional feature-based approaches to advanced machine learning and deep learning frameworks. While classical methods are reliable in controlled settings, they struggle in complex environments with occlusions, variable lighting, and high object density. Deep learning models address these challenges by delivering greater accuracy, adaptability, and robustness. This review categorizes object tracking techniques into traditional, statistical, feature-based, and machine learning paradigms, with a focus on biomedical applications. These methods are essential for tracking cells and subcellular structures, advancing our understanding of health and disease. Key performance metrics, including accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, are discussed. The paper explores limitations of current methods and highlights emerging trends to guide the development of next-generation tracking systems for biomedical research and broader scientific domains.</p></details> | 56 Pages | None |
| **[LiDAR SLAMMOT based on Confidence-guided Data Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01041v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions. Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in scenes with some missed detections.</p></details> |  | None |

Furthermore, the fixed-window memory approach in the original model does not consider the quality of memories selected to condition the image features for the next frame, leading to error propagation in videos. This paper introduces SAMURAI, an enhanced adaptation of SAM 2 specifically designed for visual object tracking. By incorporating temporal motion cues with the proposed motion-aware memory selection mechanism, SAMURAI effectively predicts object motion and refines mask selection, achieving robust, accurate tracking without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. SAMURAI operates in real-time and demonstrates strong zero-shot performance across diverse benchmark datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize without fine-tuning. In evaluations, SAMURAI achieves significant improvements in success rate and precision over existing trackers, with a 7.1% AUC gain on LaSOT$_{\text{ext}}$ and a 3.5% AO gain on GOT-10k. Moreover, it achieves competitive results compared to fully supervised methods on LaSOT, underscoring its robustness in complex tracking scenarios and its potential for real-world applications in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://yangchris11.github.io/samurai/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://yangchris11.github.io/samurai) |

While a generalist model capable of leveraging all modalities would be ideal, development is hindered by data sparsity, typically in practice, only one modality is available at a time. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure and achieve that knowledge gained from multimodal sensing -- such as identifying relevant features and regions -- is effectively shared, even when certain modalities are unavailable at inference. We venture with a simple assumption: similar samples across different modalities have more knowledge to share than otherwise. To implement this, we employ a ``weak" classifier tasked with distinguishing between modalities. More specifically, if the classifier ``fails" to accurately identify the modality of the given sample, this signals an opportunity for cross-modal knowledge sharing. Intuitively, knowledge transfer is facilitated whenever a sample from one modality is sufficiently close and aligned with another. Technically, we achieve this by routing samples from one modality to the expert of the others, within a mixture-of-experts framework designed for multimodal video object tracking. During the inference, the expert of the respective modality is chosen, which we show to benefit from the multimodal knowledge available during training, thanks to the proposed method. Through the exhaustive experiments that use only paired RGB-E, RGB-D, and RGB-T during training, we showcase the benefit of the proposed method for RGB-X tracker during inference, with an average +3\% precision improvement over the current SOTA.

While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods predominantly exploit camera detections to correct tracking failures caused by potential LiDAR detection problems, neglecting the reciprocal benefit of refining camera detections using LiDAR data. This limitation is rooted in their single-stage architecture, akin to single-stage object detectors, lacking a dedicated trajectory refinement module to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal information. To this end, we introduce CrossTracker, a novel two-stage paradigm for online multi-modal 3D MOT. CrossTracker operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, initially generating coarse trajectories and subsequently refining them through an independent refinement process. Specifically, CrossTracker incorporates three essential modules: i) a multi-modal modeling (M^3) module that, by fusing multi-modal information (images, point clouds, and even plane geometry extracted from images), provides a robust metric for subsequent trajectory generation. ii) a coarse trajectory generation (C-TG) module that generates initial coarse dual-stream trajectories, and iii) a trajectory refinement (TR) module that refines coarse trajectories through cross correction between camera and LiDAR streams. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our CrossTracker over its eighteen competitors, underscoring its effectiveness in harnessing the synergistic benefits of camera and LiDAR sensors for robust multi-modal 3D MOT.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches to dynamic object detection often rely on pretrained learned networks or computationally expensive volumetric maps. To enhance efficiency on computationally limited robots, we reuse data between the odometry and detection module. Utilizing a range image segmentation technique and a novel residual-based heuristic, our method distinguishes dynamic from static objects before integrating them into the point cloud map. The approach demonstrates robust object tracking and improved map accuracy in environments with numerous dynamic objects. Even highly non-rigid objects, such as running humans, are accurately detected at point level without prior downsampling of the point cloud and hence, without loss of information. Evaluation on simulated and real-world data validates its computational efficiency. Compared to a state-of-the-art volumetric method, our approach shows comparable detection performance at a fraction of the processing time, adding only 14 ms to the odometry module for dynamic object detection and tracking. The implementation and a new real-world dataset are available as open-source for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we reconsidered the deficiencies in the current approaches to initializing single object trackers and propose a new paradigm for single object tracking algorithms, ClickTrack, a new paradigm using clicking interaction for real-time scenarios. Moreover, click as an input type inherently lack hierarchical information. To address ambiguity in certain special scenarios, we designed the Guided Click Refiner(GCR), which accepts point and optional textual information as inputs, transforming the point into the bounding box expected by the operator. The bounding box will be used as input of single object trackers. Experiments on LaSOT and GOT-10k benchmarks show that tracker combined with GCR achieves stable performance in real-time interactive scenarios.

A Fine-grained Evaluation to Reveal the Role of Language in Vision-Language Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15600v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language tracking (VLT) extends traditional single object tracking by incorporating textual information, providing semantic guidance to enhance tracking performance under challenging conditions like fast motion and deformations. However, current VLT trackers often underperform compared to single-modality methods on multiple benchmarks, with semantic information sometimes becoming a "distraction." To address this, we propose VLTVerse, the first fine-grained evaluation framework for VLT trackers that comprehensively considers multiple challenge factors and diverse semantic information, hoping to reveal the role of language in VLT. Our contributions include: (1) VLTVerse introduces 10 sequence-level challenge labels and 6 types of multi-granularity semantic information, creating a flexible and multi-dimensional evaluation space for VLT; (2) leveraging 60 subspaces formed by combinations of challenge factors and semantic types, we conduct systematic fine-grained evaluations of three mainstream SOTA VLT trackers, uncovering their performance bottlenecks across complex scenarios and offering a novel perspective on VLT evaluation; (3) through decoupled analysis of experimental results, we examine the impact of various semantic types on specific challenge factors in relation to different algorithms, providing essential guidance for enhancing VLT across data, evaluation, and algorithmic dimensions. The VLTVerse, toolkit, and results will be available at \url{http://metaverse.aitestunion.com}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under Review</p></details> | None |

We first establish a centralised VI sensor fusion scheme as a benchmark and analyse the limitations of its decentralised counterpart, which requires sensors to await consensus at each VI iteration. Therefore, we propose a decentralised gradient-based VI framework that optimises the Locally Maximised Evidence Lower Bound (LM-ELBO) instead of the standard ELBO, which reduces the parameter search space and enables faster convergence, making it particularly beneficial for decentralised tracking. This proposed framework is inherently self-evolving, improving with advancements in decentralised optimisation techniques for convergence guarantees and efficiency. Further, we enhance the convergence speed of proposed decentralised schemes using natural gradients and gradient tracking strategies. Results verify that our decentralised VI schemes are empirically equivalent to centralised fusion in tracking performance. Notably, the decentralised natural gradient VI method is the most communication-efficient, with communication costs comparable to suboptimal decentralised strategies while delivering notably higher tracking accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing Transformer-based vision-language tracking methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging the global modeling ability of self-attention. However, current approaches still face challenges in effectively exploiting the temporal information and dynamically updating reference features during tracking. Recently, the State Space Model (SSM), known as Mamba, has shown astonishing ability in efficient long-sequence modeling. Particularly, its state space evolving process demonstrates promising capabilities in memorizing multimodal temporal information with linear complexity. Witnessing its success, we propose a Mamba-based vision-language tracking model to exploit its state space evolving ability in temporal space for robust multimodal tracking, dubbed MambaVLT. In particular, our approach mainly integrates a time-evolving hybrid state space block and a selective locality enhancement block, to capture contextual information for multimodal modeling and adaptive reference feature update. Besides, we introduce a modality-selection module that dynamically adjusts the weighting between visual and language references, mitigating potential ambiguities from either reference type. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional tracking-by-detection methods, while effective, often require extensive tuning and lack generalizability. On the other hand, segmentation mask-based methods are more generic but struggle with tracking management, making them unsuitable for MOT. We propose a novel approach, McByte, which incorporates a temporally propagated segmentation mask as a strong association cue within a tracking-by-detection framework. By combining bounding box and propagated mask information, McByte enhances robustness and generalizability without per-sequence tuning. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets - DanceTrack, MOT17, SoccerNet-tracking 2022, and KITTI-tracking - McByte demonstrates performance gain in all cases examined. At the same time, it outperforms existing mask-based methods. Implementation code will be provided upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

While end-to-end object detection and tracking have been the main focus of recent research, they have yet to outperform traditional methods in benchmarks like MOT17 and MOT20. Thus, from an application standpoint, methods with separate detection and embedding remain the best option for accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation, though they are impractical for edge devices due to the overhead involved. In this paper, we investigate a selective approach to minimize the overhead of feature extraction while preserving accuracy, modularity, and ease of implementation. This approach can be integrated into various SOTA methods. We demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to StrongSORT and Deep OC-SORT. Experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets show that our mechanism retains the advantages of feature extraction during occlusions while significantly reducing runtime. Additionally, it improves accuracy by preventing confusion in the feature-matching stage, particularly in cases of deformation and appearance similarity, which are common in DanceTrack. https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-StrongSORT, https://github.com/emirhanbayar/Fast-Deep-OC-SORT</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Most existing methods rely on the spatial-temporal motion features and appearance embedding features of the detected objects in consecutive frames. Effectively and robustly representing the spatial and appearance features of long trajectories has become a critical factor affecting the performance of MOT. We propose a novel approach for appearance and spatial-temporal motion feature representation, improving upon the hierarchical clustering association method MOT FCG. For spatialtemporal motion features, we first propose Diagonal Modulated GIoU, which more accurately represents the relationship between the position and shape of the objects. Second, Mean Constant Velocity Modeling is proposed to reduce the effect of observation noise on target motion state estimation. For appearance features, we utilize a dynamic appearance representation that incorporates confidence information, enabling the trajectory appearance features to be more robust and global. Based on the baseline model MOT FCG, we have realized further improvements in the performance of all. we achieved 63.1 HOTA, 76.9 MOTA and 78.2 IDF1 on the MOT17 test set, and also achieved competitive performance on the MOT20 and DanceTrack sets.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures | None |

Despite these advances, we find that current VLMs lack a fundamental cognitive ability: learning to localize objects in a scene by taking into account the context. In this work, we focus on the task of few-shot personalized localization, where a model is given a small set of annotated images (in-context examples) -- each with a category label and bounding box -- and is tasked with localizing the same object type in a query image. To provoke personalized localization abilities in models, we present a data-centric solution that fine-tunes them using carefully curated data from video object tracking datasets. By leveraging sequences of frames tracking the same object across multiple shots, we simulate instruction-tuning dialogues that promote context awareness. To reinforce this, we introduce a novel regularization technique that replaces object labels with pseudo-names, ensuring the model relies on visual context rather than prior knowledge. Our method significantly enhances few-shot localization performance without sacrificing generalization, as demonstrated on several benchmarks tailored to personalized localization. This work is the first to explore and benchmark personalized few-shot localization for VLMs, laying a foundation for future research in context-driven vision-language applications.

Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17 and MOT20 datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections. We furthermore demonstrate the capability of the learned model to generalize across datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance.

Precise identification of these properties is essential to manipulate objects in a stable and controlled way, and is also required to anticipate the outcomes of (prehensile or non-prehensile) manipulation actions such as pushing, pulling, lifting, etc. Our study focuses on autonomously inferring the physical properties of a diverse set of various homogeneous, heterogeneous, and articulated objects utilizing a robotic system equipped with vision and tactile sensors. We propose a novel predictive perception framework for identifying object properties of the diverse objects by leveraging versatile exploratory actions: non-prehensile pushing and prehensile pulling. As part of the framework, we propose a novel active shape perception to seamlessly initiate exploration. Our innovative dual differentiable filtering with Graph Neural Networks learns the object-robot interaction and performs consistent inference of indirectly observable time-invariant object properties. In addition, we formulate a $N$-step information gain approach to actively select the most informative actions for efficient learning and inference. Extensive real-robot experiments with planar objects show that our predictive perception framework results in better performance than the state-of-the-art baseline and demonstrate our framework in three major applications for i) object tracking, ii) goal-driven task, and iii) change in environment detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Although Tracking-by-Detection frameworks have demonstrated excellent performance in recent years, their application in real-world scenarios faces significant challenges. Object movement in complex environments is often highly nonlinear, while existing methods typically rely on linear approximations of motion. Furthermore, system noise is frequently modeled as a Gaussian distribution, which fails to capture the true complexity of the noise dynamics. These oversimplified modeling assumptions can lead to significant reductions in tracking precision. To address this, we propose a GRU-based MOT method, which introduces a learnable Kalman filter into the motion module. This approach is able to learn object motion characteristics through data-driven learning, thereby avoiding the need for manual model design and model error. At the same time, to avoid abnormal supervision caused by the wrong association between annotations and trajectories, we design a semi-supervised learning strategy to accelerate the convergence speed and improve the robustness of the model. Evaluation experiment on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrates that our system exhibits superior performance and significant potential compared to traditional TBD methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we enhance the training dataset through data fusion, enabling simultaneous detection of vehicles and pedestrians. Image preprocessing and augmentation are subsequently performed to improve the quality and quantity of the dataset. Transfer learning is applied on the YOLOv8 pretrained model to increase the model's capability to identify a diverse array of vehicles. Optimal hyperparameters are obtained using the Grid Search algorithm, with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer outperforming other optimizers under these settings.

However, the challenges of acquiring and processing long-term, ecologically relevant data in wild settings have constrained the scope of behavioural research. The increasing availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), coupled with advances in machine learning, has opened new opportunities for wildlife monitoring using aerial tracking. However, limited availability of datasets with wild animals in natural habitats has hindered progress in automated computer vision solutions for long-term animal tracking. Here we introduce BuckTales, the first large-scale UAV dataset designed to solve multi-object tracking (MOT) and re-identification (Re-ID) problem in wild animals, specifically the mating behaviour (or lekking) of blackbuck antelopes. Collected in collaboration with biologists, the MOT dataset includes over 1.2 million annotations including 680 tracks across 12 high-resolution (5.4K) videos, each averaging 66 seconds and featuring 30 to 130 individuals. The Re-ID dataset includes 730 individuals captured with two UAVs simultaneously. The dataset is designed to drive scalable, long-term animal behaviour tracking using multiple camera sensors. By providing baseline performance with two detectors, and benchmarking several state-of-the-art tracking methods, our dataset reflects the real-world challenges of tracking wild animals in socially and ecologically relevant contexts. In making these data widely available, we hope to catalyze progress in MOT and Re-ID for wild animals, fostering insights into animal behaviour, conservation efforts, and ecosystem dynamics through automated, long-term monitoring.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

The recently proposed Slot Attention module, already leveraged by several derivative works for image segmentation and object tracking in videos, is a deep learning component which performs unsupervised object-centric scene decomposition on input images. It is based on an attention architecture, in which latent slot vectors, which hold compressed information on objects, attend to localized perceptual features from the input image. In this paper, we demonstrate that design decisions on normalizing the aggregated values in the attention architecture have considerable impact on the capabilities of Slot Attention to generalize to a higher number of slots and objects as seen during training. We propose and investigate alternatives to the original normalization scheme which increase the generalization capabilities of Slot Attention to varying slot and object counts, resulting in performance gains on the task of unsupervised image segmentation. The newly proposed normalizations represent minimal and easy to implement modifications of the usual Slot Attention module, changing the value aggregation mechanism from a weighted mean operation to a scaled weighted sum operation.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |

We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA.

In this work, we fuse them together and propose the tracking-by-detection-and-query paradigm, which is achieved by a Learnable Associator.

Additionally, we develop a Feedback-Update training strategy that refines the slicing decisions using feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant performance improvements in event-based object tracking and recognition. Notably, SpikeSlicer provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture, using conditional latent diffusion models, the Latent Diffusion Track (LDTrack), for tracking multiple dynamic people under intraclass variations. By uniquely utilizing conditional latent diffusion models to capture temporal person embeddings, our architecture can adapt to appearance changes of people over time. We incorporated a latent feature encoder network which enables the diffusion process to operate within a high-dimensional latent space to allow for the extraction and spatial-temporal refinement of such rich features as person appearance, motion, location, identity, and contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LDTrack over other state-of-the-art tracking methods in cluttered and crowded human-centered environments under intraclass variations. Namely, the results show our method outperforms existing deep learning robotic people tracking methods in both tracking accuracy and tracking precision with statistical significance. Additionally, a comprehensive multi-object tracking comparison study was performed against the state-of-the-art methods in urban environments, demonstrating the generalizability of LDTrack. An ablation study was performed to validate the design choices of LDTrack.</p></details> |  | None |

By combining data from diverse sensors like cameras and LIDARs, fusion techniques can overcome the limitations of individual sensors, enabling a more complete and accurate perception of the environment. We introduce a novel approach to multi-modal sensor fusion, focusing on developing a graph-based state representation that supports critical decision-making processes in autonomous driving. We present a Sensor-Agnostic Graph-Aware Kalman Filter [3], the first online state estimation technique designed to fuse multi-modal graphs derived from noisy multi-sensor data. The estimated graph-based state representations serve as a foundation for advanced applications like Multi-Object Tracking (MOT), offering a comprehensive framework for enhancing the situational awareness and safety of autonomous systems. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world driving datasets (nuScenes). Our results showcase an improvement in MOTA and a reduction in estimated position errors (MOTP) and identity switches (IDS) for tracked objects using the SAGA-KF. Furthermore, we highlight the capability of such a framework to develop methods that can leverage heterogeneous information (like semantic objects and geometric structures) from various sensing modalities, enabling a more holistic approach to scene understanding and enhancing the safety and effectiveness of autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extended abstract accepted at Young Researchers' Symposium, ICVGIP '24.

Such limitations can be exacerbated by nonlinear object motion, particularly from an ego-centric viewpoint. It becomes evident that to address these challenges, the key lies in exploiting temporal feature relation over an extended horizon and enforcing spatial motion consistency for effective association. To this end, this paper proposes SIRA (Scalable Inter-frame Relation and Association) with two designs. First, inspired by Swin Transformer, we introduce extended temporal relation, generalizing the existing temporal relation layer from two consecutive frames to multiple inter-frames with temporally regrouped window attention for scalability. Second, we propose motion consistency track with the concept of a pseudo-tracklet generated from observational data for better trajectory prediction and subsequent object association. Our approach achieves 58.11 mAP@0.5 for oriented object detection and 47.79 MOTA for multiple object tracking on the Radiate dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by a margin of +4.11 mAP@0.5 and +9.94 MOTA, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, Accepted to CVPR2024</p></details> | None |

However, these methods directly fuse both modalities and thus ignore the environmental attributes, e.g., motion blur, illumination variance, occlusion, scale variation, etc. Meanwhile, insufficient interaction between search and template features makes distinguishing target objects and backgrounds difficult. As a result, performance degradation is induced especially in challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel and effective Transformer-based event-guided tracking framework, called eMoE-Tracker, which achieves new SOTA performance under various conditions. Our key idea is to disentangle the environment into several learnable attributes to dynamically learn the attribute-specific features and strengthen the target information by improving the interaction between the target template and search regions. To achieve the goal, we first propose an environmental Mix-of-Experts (eMoE) module that is built upon the environmental Attributes Disentanglement to learn attribute-specific features and environmental Attributes Assembling to assemble the attribute-specific features by the learnable attribute scores dynamically. The eMoE module is a subtle router that prompt-tunes the transformer backbone more efficiently. We then introduce a contrastive relation modeling (CRM) module to emphasize target information by leveraging a contrastive learning strategy between the target template and search regions. Extensive experiments on diverse event-based benchmark datasets showcase the superior performance of our eMoE-Tracker compared to the prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>RGB-e...</summary><p>RGB-event single object tracking</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we present an effective path-planning system leveraging semantic segmentation information to navigate around texture-less and problematic areas like lakes, oceans, and high-rise buildings using a monocular camera. We introduce a real-time semantic segmentation architecture and a novel keyframe decision pipeline to optimize image inputs based on pixel distribution, reducing processing time. A hierarchical planner based on the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) algorithm, integrated with a cost map, is designed to facilitate efficient path planning. The system is implemented in a photo-realistic simulation environment using Unity, aligning with segmentation model parameters.

Despite its wide application in robotics, autonomous driving, and smart manufacturing, there is limited literature addressing the specific challenges of running MOT on embedded devices. State-of-the-art MOT trackers designed for high-end GPUs often experience low processing rates (<11fps) when deployed on embedded devices. Existing MOT frameworks for embedded devices proposed strategies such as fusing the detector model with the feature embedding model to reduce inference latency or combining different trackers to improve tracking accuracy, but tend to compromise one for the other. This paper introduces HopTrack, a real-time multi-object tracking system tailored for embedded devices. Our system employs a novel discretized static and dynamic matching approach along with an innovative content-aware dynamic sampling technique to enhance tracking accuracy while meeting the real-time requirement. Compared with the best high-end GPU modified baseline Byte (Embed) and the best existing baseline on embedded devices MobileNet-JDE, HopTrack achieves a processing speed of up to 39.29 fps on NVIDIA AGX Xavier with a multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of up to 63.12% on the MOT16 benchmark, outperforming both counterparts by 2.15% and 4.82%, respectively. Additionally, the accuracy improvement is coupled with the reduction in energy consumption (20.8%), power (5%), and memory usage (8%), which are crucial resources on embedded devices. HopTrack is also detector agnostic allowing the flexibility of plug-and-play.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Is Multiple Object Tracking a Matter of Specialization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00553v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end transformer-based trackers have achieved remarkable performance on most human-related datasets. However, training these trackers in heterogeneous scenarios poses significant challenges, including negative interference - where the model learns conflicting scene-specific parameters - and limited domain generalization, which often necessitates expensive fine-tuning to adapt the models to new domains. In response to these challenges, we introduce Parameter-efficient Scenario-specific Tracking Architecture (PASTA), a novel framework that combines Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Modular Deep Learning (MDL). Specifically, we define key scenario attributes (e.g, camera-viewpoint, lighting condition) and train specialized PEFT modules for each attribute. These expert modules are combined in parameter space, enabling systematic generalization to new domains without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on MOTSynth, along with zero-shot evaluations on MOT17 and PersonPath22 demonstrate that a neural tracker built from carefully selected modules surpasses its monolithic counterpart. We release models and code.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 | None |
| **[Extended Object Tracking and Classification based on Linear Splines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24183v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a framework based on linear splines for 2-dimensional extended object tracking and classification. Unlike state of the art models, linear splines allow to represent extended objects whose contour is an arbitrarily complex curve. An exact likelihood is derived for the case in which noisy measurements can be scattered from any point on the contour of the extended object, while an approximate Monte Carlo likelihood is provided for the case wherein scattering points can be anywhere, i.e. inside or on the contour, on the object surface. Exploiting such likelihood to measure how well the observed data fit a given shape, a suitable estimator is developed. The proposed estimator models the extended object in terms of a kinematic state, providing object position and orientation, along with a shape vector, characterizing object contour and surface. The kinematic state is estimated via a nonlinear Kalman filter, while the shape vector is estimated via a Bayesian classifier so that classification is implicitly solved during shape estimation. Numerical experiments are provided to assess, compared to state of the art extended object estimators, the effectiveness of the proposed one.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IP-MOT: Instance Prompt Learning for Cross-Domain Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23907v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) aims to associate multiple objects across video frames and is a challenging vision task due to inherent complexities in the tracking environment. Most existing approaches train and track within a single domain, resulting in a lack of cross-domain generalizability to data from other domains. While several works have introduced natural language representation to bridge the domain gap in visual tracking, these textual descriptions often provide too high-level a view and fail to distinguish various instances within the same class. In this paper, we address this limitation by developing IP-MOT, an end-to-end transformer model for MOT that operates without concrete textual descriptions. Our approach is underpinned by two key innovations: Firstly, leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model, we obtain instance-level pseudo textual descriptions via prompt-tuning, which are invariant across different tracking scenes; Secondly, we introduce a query-balanced strategy, augmented by knowledge distillation, to further boost the generalization capabilities of our model. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used MOT benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack, demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance on same-domain data compared to state-of-the-art models but also significantly improves the performance of query-based trackers by large margins for cross-domain inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

It remains challenging to localize the target from surroundings due to appearance variations, distractors, and the high sparsity of point clouds. To address these issues, prior Siamese and motion-centric trackers both require elaborate designs and solving multiple subtasks. In this paper, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective baseline method. By estimating the target motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) to perform tracking, BEVTrack demonstrates surprising simplicity from various aspects, i.e., network designs, training objectives, and tracking pipeline, while achieving superior performance. Besides, to achieve accurate regression for targets with diverse attributes (e.g., sizes and motion patterns), BEVTrack constructs the likelihood function with the learned underlying distributions adapted to different targets, rather than making a fixed Laplacian or Gaussian assumption as in previous works. This provides valuable priors for tracking and thus further boosts performance. While only using a single regression loss with a plain convolutional architecture, BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets, KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset while maintaining a high inference speed of about 200 FPS.

It is primarily because of the lack of a large-scale, well-annotated night-time benchmark for rigorously evaluating tracking algorithms. To this end, this paper presents NT-VOT211, a new benchmark tailored for evaluating visual object tracking algorithms in the challenging night-time conditions. NT-VOT211 consists of 211 diverse videos, offering 211,000 well-annotated frames with 8 attributes including camera motion, deformation, fast motion, motion blur, tiny target, distractors, occlusion and out-of-view. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest night-time tracking benchmark to-date that is specifically designed to address unique challenges such as adverse visibility, image blur, and distractors inherent to night-time tracking scenarios. Through a comprehensive analysis of results obtained from 42 diverse tracking algorithms on NT-VOT211, we uncover the strengths and limitations of these algorithms, highlighting opportunities for enhancements in visual object tracking, particularly in environments with suboptimal lighting. Besides, a leaderboard for revealing performance rankings, annotation tools, comprehensive meta-information and all the necessary code for reproducibility of results is made publicly available. We believe that our NT-VOT211 benchmark will not only be instrumental in facilitating field deployment of VOT algorithms, but will also help VOT enhancements and it will unlock new real-world tracking applications.

It plays a critical role in various UAV applications, including traffic monitoring systems and real-time suspect tracking by the police. However, this task is highly challenging due to the fast motion of UAVs, as well as the small size of target objects in the videos caused by the high-altitude and wide angle views of drones. In this study, we thus introduce a simple yet more effective method compared to previous work to overcome these challenges. Our approach involves a new tracking strategy, which initiates the tracking of target objects from low-confidence detections commonly encountered in UAV application scenarios. Additionally, we propose revisiting traditional appearance-based matching algorithms to improve the association of low-confidence detections. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted benchmark evaluations on two UAV-specific datasets (VisDrone2019, UAVDT) and one general object tracking dataset (MOT17). The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the art methodologies, highlighting its robustness and adaptability in diverse tracking environments. Furthermore, we have improved the annotation of the UAVDT dataset by rectifying several errors and addressing omissions found in the original annotations.

Under this setting, open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in a single image has been studied in many literature. However, open-vocabulary object tracking (OVT) from a video has been studied less, and one reason is the shortage of benchmarks. In this work, we have built a new large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary multi-object tracking namely OVT-B. OVT-B contains 1,048 categories of objects and 1,973 videos with 637,608 bounding box annotations, which is much larger than the sole open-vocabulary tracking dataset, i.e., OVTAO-val dataset (200+ categories, 900+ videos). The proposed OVT-B can be used as a new benchmark to pave the way for OVT research. We also develop a simple yet effective baseline method for OVT. It integrates the motion features for object tracking, which is an important feature for MOT but is ignored in previous OVT methods.

Recent state-of-the-art tracking methods are founded on deep learning architectures for object detection, appearance feature extraction and track association.

Such a formulation of source coding is an alternative approach to the traditional framework and is inspired by an object tracking problem over proximity sensor networks. We define a \textit{multiset combinatorial Gray code} as a mulitset code with fixed multiset cardinality that possesses combinatorial Gray code characteristic. For source codes that are organized as a grid, namely an integer lattice, we propose a solution by first constructing a mapping from the grid to the alphabet set, the codes are then defined as the images of rectangular blocks in the grid of fixed dimensions. We refer to the mapping as a \textit{color mapping} and the code as a \textit{color multiset code}. We propose the idea of product multiset code that enables us to construct codes for high dimensional grids based on 1-dimensional (1D) grids. We provide a detailed analysis of color multiset codes on 1D grids, focusing on codes that require the minimal number of colors. To illustrate the application of such a coding scheme, we consider an object tracking problem on 2D grids and show its efficiency, which comes from exploiting transmission parallelism.

This intricate task involves the reasoning of linguistic and visual modalities, along with the temporal association of target objects. However, the seminal work employs only loose feature fusion and overlooks the utilization of long-term information on tracked objects. In this study, we introduce a compact Transformer-based method, termed TenRMOT. We conduct feature fusion at both encoding and decoding stages to fully exploit the advantages of Transformer architecture. Specifically, we incrementally perform cross-modal fusion layer-by-layer during the encoding phase. In the decoding phase, we utilize language-guided queries to probe memory features for accurate prediction of the desired objects. Moreover, we introduce a query update module that explicitly leverages temporal prior information of the tracked objects to enhance the consistency of their trajectories. In addition, we introduce a novel task called Referring Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (RMOTS) and construct a new dataset named Ref-KITTI Segmentation. Our dataset consists of 18 videos with 818 expressions, and each expression averages 10.7 masks, which poses a greater challenge compared to the typical single mask in most existing referring video segmentation datasets. TenRMOT demonstrates superior performance on both the referring multi-object tracking and the segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

The majority of existing SLAM solutions heavily rely on a primarily static assumption. However, due to the presence of moving vehicles and pedestrians, this assumption does not always hold, leading to localization accuracy decreased and maps distorted. To address this challenge, we propose TRLO, a dynamic LiDAR odometry that efficiently improves the accuracy of state estimation and generates a cleaner point cloud map. To efficiently detect dynamic objects in the surrounding environment, a deep learning-based method is applied, generating detection bounding boxes. We then design a 3D multi-object tracker based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and nearest neighbor (NN) strategy to reliably identify and remove dynamic objects. Subsequently, a fast two-stage iterative nearest point solver is employed to solve the state estimation using cleaned static point cloud. Note that a novel hash-based keyframe database management is proposed for fast access to search keyframes. Furthermore, all the detected object bounding boxes are leveraged to impose posture consistency constraint to further refine the final state estimation. Extensive evaluations and ablation studies conducted on the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves more accurate state estimation but also generates cleaner maps, compared with baselines.</p></details> | 8pages, 5figures | None |

In these applications, robust object detection and tracking are essential for the effective deployment of UAVs. However, existing benchmarks for UAV applications are mainly designed for traditional 2D perception tasks, restricting the development of real-world applications that require a 3D understanding of the environment. Furthermore, despite recent advancements in single-UAV perception, limited views of a single UAV platform significantly constrain its perception capabilities over long distances or in occluded areas. To address these challenges, we introduce UAV3D, a benchmark designed to advance research in both 3D and collaborative 3D perception tasks with UAVs. UAV3D comprises 1,000 scenes, each of which has 20 frames with fully annotated 3D bounding boxes on vehicles. We provide the benchmark for four 3D perception tasks: single-UAV 3D object detection, single-UAV object tracking, collaborative-UAV 3D object detection, and collaborative-UAV object tracking.

However, the existing methods based on either appearance or motion features encounter difficulties when the background is complex or the MAV is too small. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-guided MAV detector that can accurately identify small MAVs in complex and non-planar scenes. This detector first exploits a motion feature enhancement module to capture the motion features of small MAVs. Then it uses multi-object tracking and trajectory filtering to eliminate false positives caused by motion parallax. Finally, an appearance-based classifier and an appearance-based detector that operates on the cropped regions are used to achieve precise detection results. Our proposed method can effectively and efficiently detect extremely small MAVs from dynamic and complex backgrounds because it aggregates pixel-level motion features and eliminates false positives based on the motion and appearance features of MAVs. Experiments on the ARD-MAV dataset demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve high performance in small MAV detection under challenging conditions and outperform other state-of-the-art methods across various metrics</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

Traditional methods like the Kalman Filter (KF) often fail when measurements are intermittent, leading to rapid divergence in state estimations. To address this, we introduce SMART (Sensor Measurement Augmentation and Reacquisition Tracker), a novel approach that leverages high-frequency state estimates from the KF to guide the search for new measurements, maintaining tracking continuity even when direct measurements falter. This is crucial for dynamic environments where traditional methods struggle. Our contributions include: 1) Versatile Measurement Augmentation Using KF Feedback: We implement a versatile measurement augmentation system that serves as a backup when primary object detectors fail intermittently. This system is adaptable to various sensors, demonstrated using depth cameras where KF's 3D predictions are projected into 2D depth image coordinates, integrating nonlinear covariance propagation techniques simplified to first-order approximations. 2) Open-source ROS2 Implementation: We provide an open-source ROS2 implementation of the SMART-TRACK framework, validated in a realistic simulation environment using Gazebo and ROS2, fostering broader adaptation and further research. Our results showcase significant enhancements in tracking stability, with estimation RMSE as low as 0.04 m during measurement disruptions, advancing the robustness of UAV tracking and expanding the potential for reliable autonomous UAV operations in complex scenarios.

Diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in visual generation, making them well-suited for addressing several requirements of the tracking problem. This work proposes a novel diffusion-based methodology to formulate the tracking task. Firstly, their conditional process allows for injecting indications of the target object into the generation process. Secondly, diffusion mechanics can be developed to inherently model temporal correspondences, enabling the reconstruction of actual frames in video. However, existing diffusion models rely on extensive and unnecessary mapping to a Gaussian noise domain, which can be replaced by a more efficient and stable interpolation process. Our proposed interpolation mechanism draws inspiration from classic image-processing techniques, offering a more interpretable, stable, and faster approach tailored specifically for the object tracking task. By leveraging the strengths of diffusion models while circumventing their limitations, our Diffusion-based INterpolation TrackeR (DINTR) presents a promising new paradigm and achieves a superior multiplicity on seven benchmarks across five indicator representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

Traditional model-based tracking approaches incorporate the geometric effect of object- and ego motion between frames with a geometric motion model.

Combined with a novel learnable track embedding that aids in modeling the existence probability of tracks, this results in a generic tracking framework that can be integrated with any query-based detector. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the benefits of our approach, showing state-of-the-art performance for DETR3D-based trackers while drastically reducing the number of identity switches of tracks at the same time.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2023 IEEE.

To address this challenge, we proposes a cooperative shared control framework based on brain-inspired intelligence, where control signals are decoded from neural activity, and the robot handles the fine control. This allows for a combination of flexible and adaptive interaction control between the robot and the brain, making intricate human-robot collaboration feasible. The proposed framework utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs) for controlling robotic arm and wheel, including speed and steering.

Generic Multiple Object Tracking (GMOT) emerges as a promising solution, requiring less prior information. Nevertheless, existing GMOT methods, primarily designed as OneShot-GMOT, rely heavily on initial bounding boxes and often struggle with variations in viewpoint, lighting, occlusion, and scale. To overcome the limitations inherent in both MOT and GMOT when it comes to tracking objects with specific generic attributes, we introduce Grounded-GMOT, an innovative tracking paradigm that enables users to track multiple generic objects in videos through natural language descriptors. Our contributions begin with the introduction of the G2MOT dataset, which includes a collection of videos featuring a wide variety of generic objects, each accompanied by detailed textual descriptions of their attributes. Following this, we propose a novel tracking method, KAM-SORT, which not only effectively integrates visual appearance with motion cues but also enhances the Kalman filter. KAM-SORT proves particularly advantageous when dealing with objects of high visual similarity from the same generic category in GMOT scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grounded-GMOT outperforms existing OneShot-GMOT approaches. Additionally, our extensive comparisons between various trackers highlight KAM-SORT's efficacy in GMOT, further establishing its significance in the field.

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has excelled in static image segmentation, extending its capabilities to video segmentation poses significant challenges. We tackle two major hurdles: a) SAM's embedding limitations in associating objects across frames, and b) granularity inconsistencies in object segmentation. To this end, we introduce VideoSAM, an end-to-end framework designed to address these challenges by improving object tracking and segmentation consistency in dynamic environments. VideoSAM integrates an agglomerated backbone, RADIO, enabling object association through similarity metrics and introduces Cycle-ack-Pairs Propagation with a memory mechanism for stable object tracking. Additionally, we incorporate an autoregressive object-token mechanism within the SAM decoder to maintain consistent granularity across frames. Our method is extensively evaluated on the UVO and BURST benchmarks, and robotic videos from RoboTAP, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios.

In applications such as pedestrian tracking, where sensitive personal data is involved, the potential for privacy violations and data misuse becomes a significant issue if data is transmitted to external servers. To mitigate these risks, processing data directly on an edge device, such as a smart camera, has emerged as a viable solution. Edge computing ensures that sensitive information remains local, thereby aligning with stringent privacy principles and significantly reducing network latency. However, the implementation of MOT on edge devices is not without its challenges. Edge devices typically possess limited computational resources, necessitating the development of highly optimized algorithms capable of delivering real-time performance under these constraints. The disparity between the computational requirements of state-of-the-art MOT algorithms and the capabilities of edge devices emphasizes a significant obstacle. To address these challenges, we propose a neural network pruning method specifically tailored to compress complex networks, such as those used in modern MOT systems. This approach optimizes MOT performance by ensuring high accuracy and efficiency within the constraints of limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano. By applying our pruning method, we achieve model size reductions of up to 70% while maintaining a high level of accuracy and further improving performance on the Jetson Orin Nano, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for edge computing applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This issue amalgamates the complexities of open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) and multi-object tracking (MOT). Existing approaches to OVMOT often merge OVD and MOT methodologies as separate modules, predominantly focusing on the problem through an image-centric lens. In this paper, we propose VOVTrack, a novel method that integrates object states relevant to MOT and video-centric training to address this challenge from a video object tracking standpoint. First, we consider the tracking-related state of the objects during tracking and propose a new prompt-guided attention mechanism for more accurate localization and classification (detection) of the time-varying objects. Subsequently, we leverage raw video data without annotations for training by formulating a self-supervised object similarity learning technique to facilitate temporal object association (tracking). Experimental results underscore that VOVTrack outperforms existing methods, establishing itself as a state-of-the-art solution for open-vocabulary tracking task.</p></details> |  | None |

By leveraging high-level semantic information, VLT guides object tracking, alleviating the constraints associated with relying on a visual modality. Nevertheless, most VLT benchmarks are annotated in a single granularity and lack a coherent semantic framework to provide scientific guidance. Moreover, coordinating human annotators for high-quality annotations is laborious and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce DTLLM-VLT, which automatically generates extensive and multi-granularity text to enhance environmental diversity. (1) DTLLM-VLT generates scientific and multi-granularity text descriptions using a cohesive prompt framework. Its succinct and highly adaptable design allows seamless integration into various visual tracking benchmarks. (2) We select three prominent benchmarks to deploy our approach: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking. We offer four granularity combinations for these benchmarks, considering the extent and density of semantic information, thereby showcasing the practicality and versatility of DTLLM-VLT. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on VLT benchmarks with different text granularities, evaluating and analyzing the impact of diverse text on tracking performance. Conclusionally, this work leverages LLM to provide multi-granularity semantic information for VLT task from efficient and diverse perspectives, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers.

| **[DTVLT: A Multi-modal Diverse Text Benchmark for Visual Language Tracking Based on LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02492v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language tracking (VLT) has emerged as a cutting-edge research area, harnessing linguistic data to enhance algorithms with multi-modal inputs and broadening the scope of traditional single object tracking (SOT) to encompass video understanding applications. Despite this, most VLT benchmarks still depend on succinct, human-annotated text descriptions for each video. These descriptions often fall short in capturing the nuances of video content dynamics and lack stylistic variety in language, constrained by their uniform level of detail and a fixed annotation frequency. As a result, algorithms tend to default to a "memorize the answer" strategy, diverging from the core objective of achieving a deeper understanding of video content. Fortunately, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of diverse text. This work utilizes LLMs to generate varied semantic annotations (in terms of text lengths and granularities) for representative SOT benchmarks, thereby establishing a novel multi-modal benchmark. Specifically, we (1) propose a new visual language tracking benchmark with diverse texts, named DTVLT, based on five prominent VLT and SOT benchmarks, including three sub-tasks: short-term tracking, long-term tracking, and global instance tracking. (2) We offer four granularity texts in our benchmark, considering the extent and density of semantic information. We expect this multi-granular generation strategy to foster a favorable environment for VLT and video understanding research. (3) We conduct comprehensive experimental analyses on DTVLT, evaluating the impact of diverse text on tracking performance and hope the identified performance bottlenecks of existing algorithms can support further research in VLT and video understanding. The proposed benchmark, experimental results and toolkit will be released gradually on http://videocube.aitestunion.com/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under Review</p></details> | None |

Current methods rely heavily on threshold-based filtering of false positive detections using detection scores to prevent ghost trajectories. However, this approach is inadequate for distant and partially occluded objects, where detection scores tend to drop, potentially leading to false positives exceeding the threshold. Additionally, the literature generally treats detections as precise localizations of objects. Our research reveals that noise in detections impacts localization information, causing trajectory drift for occluded objects and hindering recovery. To this end, we propose a novel online track validity mechanism that temporally distinguishes between legitimate and ghost tracks, along with a multi-stage observational gating process for incoming observations. This mechanism significantly improves tracking performance, with a $6.28\%$ in HOTA and a $17.87\%$ increase in MOTA. We also introduce a refinement to the Kalman filter that enhances noise mitigation in trajectory drift, leading to more robust state estimation for occluded objects. Our framework, RobMOT, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including deep learning approaches, across various detectors, achieving up to a $4\%$ margin in HOTA and $6\%$ in MOTA. RobMOT excels under challenging conditions, such as prolonged occlusions and tracking distant objects, with up to a 59\% improvement in processing latency.</p></details> |  | None |

Like single-camera multiple-object tracking, it is commonly formulated as a graph problem of tracking-by-detection. Within this framework, existing online methods usually consist of two-stage procedures that cluster temporally first, then spatially, or vice versa. This is computationally expensive and prone to error accumulation. We introduce a graph representation that allows spatial-temporal clustering in a single, combined step: New detections are spatially and temporally connected with existing clusters. By keeping sparse appearance and positional cues of all detections in a cluster, our method can compare clusters based on the strongest available evidence. The final tracks are obtained online using a simple multicut assignment procedure. Our method does not require any training on the target scene, pre-extraction of single-camera tracks, or additional annotations. Notably, we outperform the online state-of-the-art on the CityFlow dataset in terms of IDF1 by more than 14%, and on the Synthehicle dataset by more than 25%, respectively.

In these settings, objects frequently move in coordinated patterns, occlude each other, and exhibit long-term dependencies in their trajectories. However, it remains a key open research question on how to model long-range dependencies within tracklets, interdependencies among tracklets, and the associated temporal occlusions. To this end, we introduce Samba, a novel linear-time set-of-sequences model designed to jointly process multiple tracklets by synchronizing the multiple selective state-spaces used to model each tracklet. Samba autoregressively predicts the future track query for each sequence while maintaining synchronized long-term memory representations across tracklets. By integrating Samba into a tracking-by-propagation framework, we propose SambaMOTR, the first tracker effectively addressing the aforementioned issues, including long-range dependencies, tracklet interdependencies, and temporal occlusions. Additionally, we introduce an effective technique for dealing with uncertain observations (MaskObs) and an efficient training recipe to scale SambaMOTR to longer sequences. By modeling long-range dependencies and interactions among tracked objects, SambaMOTR implicitly learns to track objects accurately through occlusions without any hand-crafted heuristics. Our approach significantly surpasses prior state-of-the-art on the DanceTrack, BFT, and SportsMOT datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SharkTrack: an accurate, generalisable software for streamlining shark and ray underwater video analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20623v3)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elasmobranchs (shark sand rays) represent a critical component of marine ecosystems. Yet, they are experiencing global population declines and effective monitoring of populations is essential to their protection. Underwater stationary videos, such as those from Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS), are critical for understanding elasmobranch spatial ecology and abundance. However, processing these videos requires time-consuming manual analysis that can delay conservation. To address this challenge, we developed SharkTrack, a semi-automatic underwater video analysis software. SharkTrack uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Object Tracking to automatically detect and track elasmobranchs and provides an annotation pipeline to manually classify elasmobranch species and compute species-specific MaxN (ssMaxN), the standard metric of relative abundance. When tested on BRUVS footage from locations unseen by the CNN model during training, SharkTrack computed ssMaxN with 89% accuracy over 207 hours of footage. The semi-automatic SharkTrack pipeline required two minutes of manual classification per hour of video, an estimated 95% reduction of manual analysis time compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate SharkTrack accuracy across diverse marine ecosystems and elasmobranch species, an advancement compared to previous models, which were limited to specific species or locations. SharkTrack applications extend beyond BRUVS, facilitating the analysis of any underwater stationary video. By making video analysis faster and more accessible, SharkTrack enables research and conservation organisations to monitor elasmobranch populations more efficiently, thereby improving conservation efforts. To further support these goals, we provide public access to the SharkTrack software.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of large language models, and augmented by the Segment Anything Model, VideoLISA generates temporally consistent segmentation masks in videos based on language instructions. Existing image-based methods, such as LISA, struggle with video tasks due to the additional temporal dimension, which requires temporal dynamic understanding and consistent segmentation across frames. VideoLISA addresses these challenges by integrating a Sparse Dense Sampling strategy into the video-LLM, which balances temporal context and spatial detail within computational constraints.

Dynamic target representation adaptation against distractors is challenging due to the limited discriminative capabilities of prevailing trackers. We present a new visual Prompting mechanism for generic Visual Object Tracking (PiVOT) to address this issue. PiVOT proposes a prompt generation network with the pre-trained foundation model CLIP to automatically generate and refine visual prompts, enabling the transfer of foundation model knowledge for tracking. While CLIP offers broad category-level knowledge, the tracker, trained on instance-specific data, excels at recognizing unique object instances. Thus, PiVOT first compiles a visual prompt highlighting potential target locations. To transfer the knowledge of CLIP to the tracker, PiVOT leverages CLIP to refine the visual prompt based on the similarities between candidate objects and the reference templates across potential targets. Once the visual prompt is refined, it can better highlight potential target locations, thereby reducing irrelevant prompt information. With the proposed prompting mechanism, the tracker can generate improved instance-aware feature maps through the guidance of the visual prompt, thus effectively reducing distractors. The proposed method does not involve CLIP during training, thereby keeping the same training complexity and preserving the generalization capability of the pretrained foundation model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks indicate that PiVOT, using the proposed prompting method can suppress distracting objects and enhance the tracker.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and to appear in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> | None |

Event cameras, known for their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous changes, have gained significant attention for their potential in feature tracking, especially in challenging conditions. However, event cameras lack the fine-grained texture information that conventional cameras provide, leading to error accumulation in tracking. To address this, we propose a novel framework, BlinkTrack, which integrates event data with RGB images for high-frequency feature tracking. Our method extends the traditional Kalman filter into a learning-based framework, utilizing differentiable Kalman filters in both event and image branches. This approach improves single-modality tracking, resolves ambiguities, and supports asynchronous data fusion. We also introduce new synthetic and augmented datasets to better evaluate our model. Experimental results indicate that BlinkTrack significantly outperforms existing event-based methods, exceeding 100 FPS with preprocessed event data and 80 FPS with multi-modality data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FruitNeRF: A Unified Neural Radiance Field based Fruit Counting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06190v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FruitNeRF, a unified novel fruit counting framework that leverages state-of-the-art view synthesis methods to count any fruit type directly in 3D. Our framework takes an unordered set of posed images captured by a monocular camera and segments fruit in each image. To make our system independent of the fruit type, we employ a foundation model that generates binary segmentation masks for any fruit. Utilizing both modalities, RGB and semantic, we train a semantic neural radiance field. Through uniform volume sampling of the implicit Fruit Field, we obtain fruit-only point clouds. By applying cascaded clustering on the extracted point cloud, our approach achieves precise fruit count.The use of neural radiance fields provides significant advantages over conventional methods such as object tracking or optical flow, as the counting itself is lifted into 3D. Our method prevents double counting fruit and avoids counting irrelevant fruit.We evaluate our methodology using both real-world and synthetic datasets. The real-world dataset consists of three apple trees with manually counted ground truths, a benchmark apple dataset with one row and ground truth fruit location, while the synthetic dataset comprises various fruit types including apple, plum, lemon, pear, peach, and mango.Additionally, we assess the performance of fruit counting using the foundation model compared to a U-Net.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://meyerls.github.io/fruit_nerf/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://meyerls.github.io/fruit_nerf) |
| **[General Compression Framework for Efficient Transformer Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17564v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trackers have established a dominant role in the field of visual object tracking. While these trackers exhibit promising performance, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to inefficiencies. To improve the inference efficiency and reduce the computation cost, prior approaches have aimed to either design lightweight trackers or distill knowledge from larger teacher models into more compact student trackers. However, these solutions often sacrifice accuracy for speed. Thus, we propose a general model compression framework for efficient transformer object tracking, named CompressTracker, to reduce the size of a pre-trained tracking model into a lightweight tracker with minimal performance degradation. Our approach features a novel stage division strategy that segments the transformer layers of the teacher model into distinct stages, enabling the student model to emulate each corresponding teacher stage more effectively. Additionally, we also design a unique replacement training technique that involves randomly substituting specific stages in the student model with those from the teacher model, as opposed to training the student model in isolation. Replacement training enhances the student model's ability to replicate the teacher model's behavior. To further forcing student model to emulate teacher model, we incorporate prediction guidance and stage-wise feature mimicking to provide additional supervision during the teacher model's compression process. Our framework CompressTracker is structurally agnostic, making it compatible with any transformer architecture. We conduct a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness and generalizability of CompressTracker. Our CompressTracker-4 with 4 transformer layers, which is compressed from OSTrack, retains about 96% performance on LaSOT (66.1% AUC) while achieves 2.17x speed up.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CAMOT: Camera Angle-aware Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17533v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes CAMOT, a simple camera angle estimator for multi-object tracking to tackle two problems: 1) occlusion and 2) inaccurate distance estimation in the depth direction. Under the assumption that multiple objects are located on a flat plane in each video frame, CAMOT estimates the camera angle using object detection. In addition, it gives the depth of each object, enabling pseudo-3D MOT. We evaluated its performance by adding it to various 2D MOT methods on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets and confirmed its effectiveness. Applying CAMOT to ByteTrack, we obtained 63.8% HOTA, 80.6% MOTA, and 78.5% IDF1 in MOT17, which are state-of-the-art results. Its computational cost is significantly lower than the existing deep-learning-based depth estimators for tracking.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Walker: Self-supervised Multiple Object Tracking by Walking on Temporal Appearance Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17221v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The supervision of state-of-the-art multiple object tracking (MOT) methods requires enormous annotation efforts to provide bounding boxes for all frames of all videos, and instance IDs to associate them through time. To this end, we introduce Walker, the first self-supervised tracker that learns from videos with sparse bounding box annotations, and no tracking labels. First, we design a quasi-dense temporal object appearance graph, and propose a novel multi-positive contrastive objective to optimize random walks on the graph and learn instance similarities. Then, we introduce an algorithm to enforce mutually-exclusive connective properties across instances in the graph, optimizing the learned topology for MOT. At inference time, we propose to associate detected instances to tracklets based on the max-likelihood transition state under motion-constrained bi-directional walks. Walker is the first self-supervised tracker to achieve competitive performance on MOT17, DanceTrack, and BDD100K. Remarkably, our proposal outperforms the previous self-supervised trackers even when drastically reducing the annotation requirements by up to 400x.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |

Automated data driven metrics can alleviate these difficulties, as demonstrated by existing machine learning instrument tracking models in minimally invasive surgery. However, these models have been tested on limited datasets of laparoscopic surgery, with a focus on isolated tasks and robotic surgery. In this paper, a new public dataset is introduced, focusing on simulated surgery, using the nasal phase of endoscopic pituitary surgery as an exemplar. Simulated surgery allows for a realistic yet repeatable environment, meaning the insights gained from automated assessment can be used by novice surgeons to hone their skills on the simulator before moving to real surgery. PRINTNet (Pituitary Real-time INstrument Tracking Network) has been created as a baseline model for this automated assessment. Consisting of DeepLabV3 for classification and segmentation; StrongSORT for tracking; and the NVIDIA Holoscan SDK for real-time performance, PRINTNet achieved 71.9% Multiple Object Tracking Precision running at 22 Frames Per Second. Using this tracking output, a Multilayer Perceptron achieved 87% accuracy in predicting surgical skill level (novice or expert), with the "ratio of total procedure time to instrument visible time" correlated with higher surgical skill. This therefore demonstrates the feasibility of automated surgical skill assessment in simulated endoscopic pituitary surgery. The new publicly available dataset can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5522/04/26511049.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Conditional Generative Denoiser for Nighttime UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16834v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art (SOTA) visual object tracking methods have significantly enhanced the autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, in low-light conditions, the presence of irregular real noise from the environments severely degrades the performance of these SOTA methods. Moreover, existing SOTA denoising techniques often fail to meet the real-time processing requirements when deployed as plug-and-play denoisers for UAV tracking. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel conditional generative denoiser (CGDenoiser), which breaks free from the limitations of traditional deterministic paradigms and generates the noise conditioning on the input, subsequently removing it. To better align the input dimensions and accelerate inference, a novel nested residual Transformer conditionalizer is developed. Furthermore, an innovative multi-kernel conditional refiner is designed to pertinently refine the denoised output. Extensive experiments show that CGDenoiser promotes the tracking precision of the SOTA tracker by 18.18\% on DarkTrack2021 whereas working 5.8 times faster than the second well-performed denoiser. Real-world tests with complex challenges also prove the effectiveness and practicality of CGDenoiser. Code, video demo and supplementary proof for CGDenoier are now available at: \url{https://github.com/vision4robotics/CGDenoiser}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/vision4robotics/CGDenoiser) |

However, learning robust object representations for UAV tracking is especially challenging in complex dynamic environments, when confronted with aspect ratio change and occlusion. These challenges severely alter the original information of the object. To handle the above issues, this work proposes a novel progressive representation learning framework for UAV tracking, i.e., PRL-Track. Specifically, PRL-Track is divided into coarse representation learning and fine representation learning. For coarse representation learning, two innovative regulators, which rely on appearance and semantic information, are designed to mitigate appearance interference and capture semantic information. Furthermore, for fine representation learning, a new hierarchical modeling generator is developed to intertwine coarse object representations. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PRL-Track delivers exceptional performance on three authoritative UAV tracking benchmarks. Real-world tests indicate that the proposed PRL-Track realizes superior tracking performance with 42.6 frames per second on the typical UAV platform equipped with an edge smart camera.

| **[Enhancing Nighttime UAV Tracking with Light Distribution Suppression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16631v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object tracking has boosted extensive intelligent applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking always neglect the uneven light distribution in low-light images, inevitably leading to excessive enhancement in scenarios with complex illumination. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel enhancer, i.e., LDEnhancer, enhancing nighttime UAV tracking with light distribution suppression. Specifically, a novel image content refinement module is developed to decompose the light distribution information and image content information in the feature space, allowing for the targeted enhancement of the image content information. Then this work designs a new light distribution generation module to capture light distribution effectively. The features with light distribution information and image content information are fed into the different parameter estimation modules, respectively, for the parameter map prediction. Finally, leveraging two parameter maps, an innovative interweave iteration adjustment is proposed for the collaborative pixel-wise adjustment of low-light images. Additionally, a challenging nighttime UAV tracking dataset with uneven light distribution, namely NAT2024-2, is constructed to provide a comprehensive evaluation, which contains 40 challenging sequences with over 74K frames in total. Experimental results on the authoritative UAV benchmarks and the proposed NAT2024-2 demonstrate that LDEnhancer outperforms other SOTA low-light enhancers for nighttime UAV tracking. Furthermore, real-world tests on a typical UAV platform with an NVIDIA Orin NX confirm the practicality and efficiency of LDEnhancer.

Although recent deep learning frameworks like TrackNetV1, V2, and V3 have advanced tennis ball and shuttlecock tracking, they often struggle in scenarios with partial occlusion or low visibility. This is primarily because these models rely heavily on visual features without explicitly incorporating motion information, which is crucial for precise tracking and trajectory prediction. In this paper, we introduce an enhancement to the TrackNet family by fusing high-level visual features with learnable motion attention maps through a motion-aware fusion mechanism, effectively emphasizing the moving ball's location and improving tracking performance. Our approach leverages frame differencing maps, modulated by a motion prompt layer, to highlight key motion regions over time. Experimental results on the tennis ball and shuttlecock datasets show that our method enhances the tracking performance of both TrackNetV2 and V3. We refer to our lightweight, plug-and-play solution, built on top of the existing TrackNet, as TrackNetV4.</p></details> | Research report | None |
| **[RockTrack: A 3D Robust Multi-Camera-Ken Multi-Object Tracking Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11749v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) obtains significant performance improvements with the rapid advancements in 3D object detection, particularly in cost-effective multi-camera setups. However, the prevalent end-to-end training approach for multi-camera trackers results in detector-specific models, limiting their versatility. Moreover, current generic trackers overlook the unique features of multi-camera detectors, i.e., the unreliability of motion observations and the feasibility of visual information. To address these challenges, we propose RockTrack, a 3D MOT method for multi-camera detectors. Following the Tracking-By-Detection framework, RockTrack is compatible with various off-the-shelf detectors. RockTrack incorporates a confidence-guided preprocessing module to extract reliable motion and image observations from distinct representation spaces from a single detector. These observations are then fused in an association module that leverages geometric and appearance cues to minimize mismatches. The resulting matches are propagated through a staged estimation process, forming the basis for heuristic noise modeling. Additionally, we introduce a novel appearance similarity metric for explicitly characterizing object affinities in multi-camera settings. RockTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes vision-only tracking leaderboard with 59.1% AMOTA while demonstrating impressive computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>RockT...</summary><p>RockTrack establishes a new state-of-the-art with 59.1% AMOTA on the nuScenes vision-only test leaderboard with ResNet50-level backbone</p></details> | None |

Currently, the best-performing methods are mainly based on pure appearance matching. Due to the complexity of motion patterns in the large-vocabulary scenarios and unstable classification of the novel objects, the motion and semantics cues are either ignored or applied based on heuristics in the final matching steps by existing methods. In this paper, we present a unified framework SLAck that jointly considers semantics, location, and appearance priors in the early steps of association and learns how to integrate all valuable information through a lightweight spatial and temporal object graph. Our method eliminates complex post-processing heuristics for fusing different cues and boosts the association performance significantly for large-scale open-vocabulary tracking. Without bells and whistles, we outperform previous state-of-the-art methods for novel classes tracking on the open-vocabulary MOT and TAO TETA benchmarks.

Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tracking Virtual Meetings in the Wild: Re-identification in Multi-Participant Virtual Meetings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09841v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, workplaces and educational institutes have widely adopted virtual meeting platforms. This has led to a growing interest in analyzing and extracting insights from these meetings, which requires effective detection and tracking of unique individuals. In practice, there is no standardization in video meetings recording layout, and how they are captured across the different platforms and services. This, in turn, creates a challenge in acquiring this data stream and analyzing it in a uniform fashion. Our approach provides a solution to the most general form of video recording, usually consisting of a grid of participants (\cref{fig:videomeeting}) from a single video source with no metadata on participant locations, while using the least amount of constraints and assumptions as to how the data was acquired. Conventional approaches often use YOLO models coupled with tracking algorithms, assuming linear motion trajectories akin to that observed in CCTV footage. However, such assumptions fall short in virtual meetings, where participant video feed window can abruptly change location across the grid. In an organic video meeting setting, participants frequently join and leave, leading to sudden, non-linear movements on the video grid. This disrupts optical flow-based tracking methods that depend on linear motion. Consequently, standard object detection and tracking methods might mistakenly assign multiple participants to the same tracker. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to track and re-identify participants in remote video meetings, by utilizing the spatio-temporal priors arising from the data in our domain. This, in turn, increases tracking capabilities compared to the use of general object tracking. Our approach reduces the error rate by 95% on average compared to YOLO-based tracking methods as a baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024 workshop</p></details> | None |

Traditionally, parametric techniques have been employed for this task. However, recent advancements have seen a shift towards learning-based methods. Given the rapid pace of research and the frequent introduction of new image matching methods, it is essential to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various image matching methods using a structure-from-motion pipeline. We assess the performance of these methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, identifying key limitations in both the methods and benchmarks. We also investigate the impact of edge detection as a pre-processing step. Our analysis reveals that image matching for 3D reconstruction remains an open challenge, necessitating careful selection and tuning of models for specific scenarios, while also highlighting mismatches in how metrics currently represent method performance.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Convolutional Unscented Kalman Filter for Multi-Object Tracking with Outliers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01380v2)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an essential technique for navigation in autonomous driving. In tracking-by-detection systems, biases, false positives, and misses, which are referred to as outliers, are inevitable due to complex traffic scenarios. Recent tracking methods are based on filtering algorithms that overlook these outliers, leading to reduced tracking accuracy or even loss of the objects trajectory. To handle this challenge, we adopt a probabilistic perspective, regarding the generation of outliers as misspecification between the actual distribution of measurement data and the nominal measurement model used for filtering. We further demonstrate that, by designing a convolutional operation, we can mitigate this misspecification. Incorporating this operation into the widely used unscented Kalman filter (UKF) in commonly adopted tracking algorithms, we derive a variant of the UKF that is robust to outliers, called the convolutional UKF (ConvUKF). We show that ConvUKF maintains the Gaussian conjugate property, thus allowing for real-time tracking. We also prove that ConvUKF has a bounded tracking error in the presence of outliers, which implies robust stability. The experimental results on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets show improved accuracy compared to representative baseline algorithms for MOT tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles</p></details> | None |

Classical closed-vocabulary MOT (CV-MOT) methods aim to track objects of predefined categories. Recently, some open-vocabulary MOT (OV-MOT) methods have successfully addressed the problem of tracking unknown categories. However, we found that the CV-MOT and OV-MOT methods each struggle to excel in the tasks of the other. In this paper, we present a unified framework, Associate Everything Detected (AED), that simultaneously tackles CV-MOT and OV-MOT by integrating with any off-the-shelf detector and supports unknown categories. Different from existing tracking-by-detection MOT methods, AED gets rid of prior knowledge (e.g. motion cues) and relies solely on highly robust feature learning to handle complex trajectories in OV-MOT tasks while keeping excellent performance in CV-MOT tasks. Specifically, we model the association task as a similarity decoding problem and propose a sim-decoder with an association-centric learning mechanism. The sim-decoder calculates similarities in three aspects: spatial, temporal, and cross-clip. Subsequently, association-centric learning leverages these threefold similarities to ensure that the extracted features are appropriate for continuous tracking and robust enough to generalize to unknown categories. Compared with existing powerful OV-MOT and CV-MOT methods, AED achieves superior performance on TAO, SportsMOT, and DanceTrack without any prior knowledge.

Recent methods address occlusions using appearance cues through online learning techniques to improve adaptivity or offline learning techniques to utilize temporal information from videos. However, most existing online learning-based MOT methods are unable to learn from all past tracking information to improve adaptivity on long-term occlusions while maintaining real-time tracking speed. On the other hand, temporal information-based offline learning methods maintain a long-term memory to store past tracking information, but this approach restricts them to use only local past information during tracking. To address these challenges, we propose a new MOT framework called the Feature Adaptive Continual-learning Tracker (FACT), which enables real-time tracking and feature learning for targets by utilizing all past tracking information. We demonstrate that the framework can be integrated with various state-of-the-art feature-based trackers, thereby improving their tracking ability. Specifically, we develop the feature adaptive continual-learning (FAC) module, a neural network that can be trained online to learn features adaptively using all past tracking information during tracking. Moreover, we also introduce a two-stage association module specifically designed for the proposed continual learning-based tracking. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art online tracking performance on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks.
