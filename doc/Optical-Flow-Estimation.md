| **[BAT: Learning Event-based Optical Flow with Bidirectional Adaptive Temporal Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03256v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras deliver visual information characterized by a high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, offering significant advantages in estimating optical flow for complex lighting conditions and fast-moving objects. Current advanced optical flow methods for event cameras largely adopt established image-based frameworks. However, the spatial sparsity of event data limits their performance. In this paper, we present BAT, an innovative framework that estimates event-based optical flow using bidirectional adaptive temporal correlation. BAT includes three novel designs: 1) a bidirectional temporal correlation that transforms bidirectional temporally dense motion cues into spatially dense ones, enabling accurate and spatially dense optical flow estimation; 2) an adaptive temporal sampling strategy for maintaining temporal consistency in correlation; 3) spatially adaptive temporal motion aggregation to efficiently and adaptively aggregate consistent target motion features into adjacent motion features while suppressing inconsistent ones. Our results rank $1^{st}$ on the DSEC-Flow benchmark, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while also exhibiting sharp edges and high-quality details. Notably, our BAT can accurately predict future optical flow using only past events, significantly outperforming E-RAFT's warm-start approach.

However, their memory consumption increases quadratically with input resolution, rendering them impractical for high-resolution images. In this paper, we present MeFlow, a novel memory-efficient method for high-resolution optical flow estimation. The key of MeFlow is a recurrent local orthogonal cost volume representation, which decomposes the 2D search space dynamically into two 1D orthogonal spaces, enabling our method to scale effectively to very high-resolution inputs. To preserve essential information in the orthogonal space, we utilize self attention to propagate feature information from the 2D space to the orthogonal space. We further propose a radius-distribution multi-scale lookup strategy to model the correspondences of large displacements at a negligible cost. We verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method on the challenging Sintel and KITTI benchmarks, and real-world 4K ($2160\!\times\!3840$) images. Our method achieves competitive performance on both Sintel and KITTI benchmarks, while maintaining the highest memory efficiency on high-resolution inputs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[EVLoc: Event-based Visual Localization in LiDAR Maps via Event-Depth Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00167v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors with some notable features, including high dynamic range and low latency, which makes them exceptionally suitable for perception in challenging scenarios such as high-speed motion and extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we explore their potential for localization within pre-existing LiDAR maps, a critical task for applications that require precise navigation and mobile manipulation. Our framework follows a paradigm based on the refinement of an initial pose. Specifically, we first project LiDAR points into 2D space based on a rough initial pose to obtain depth maps, and then employ an optical flow estimation network to align events with LiDAR points in 2D space, followed by camera pose estimation using a PnP solver. To enhance geometric consistency between these two inherently different modalities, we develop a novel frame-based event representation that improves structural clarity. Additionally, given the varying degrees of bias observed in the ground truth poses, we design a module that predicts an auxiliary variable as a regularization term to mitigate the impact of this bias on network convergence. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. To facilitate future research, both the code and the pre-trained models are made available online.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[L4P: Low-Level 4D Vision Perception Unified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13078v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relationship between the pixels of a video carries critical information for low-level 4D perception. A single model that reasons about it should be able to solve several such tasks well. Yet, most state-of-the-art methods rely on architectures specialized for the task at hand. We present L4P (pronounced "LAP"), a feedforward, general-purpose architecture that solves low-level 4D perception tasks in a unified framework. L4P combines a ViT-based backbone with per-task heads that are lightweight and therefore do not require extensive training. Despite its general and feedforward formulation, our method matches or surpasses the performance of existing specialized methods on both dense tasks, such as depth or optical flow estimation, and sparse tasks, such as 2D/3D tracking. Moreover, it solves all those tasks at once in a time comparable to that of individual single-task methods.</p></details> |  | None |

For automatically generating an adaptive grid we introduce indicators based on a-posteriori error estimates. Further we discuss data interpolation methods on unstructured grids in the context of image processing and present a pixel-based interpolation method. The efficiency of our derived adaptive finite element scheme is demonstrated on image inpainting and the task of computing the optical flow in image sequences. In particular, for optical flow estimation we derive an adaptive finite element coarse-to-fine scheme which allows resolving large displacements and speeds-up the computing time significantly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CMRNext: Camera to LiDAR Matching in the Wild for Localization and Extrinsic Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00129v5)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDARs are widely used for mapping and localization in dynamic environments. However, their high cost limits their widespread adoption. On the other hand, monocular localization in LiDAR maps using inexpensive cameras is a cost-effective alternative for large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, most existing approaches struggle to generalize to new sensor setups and environments, requiring retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we present CMRNext, a novel approach for camera-LIDAR matching that is independent of sensor-specific parameters, generalizable, and can be used in the wild for monocular localization in LiDAR maps and camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration. CMRNext exploits recent advances in deep neural networks for matching cross-modal data and standard geometric techniques for robust pose estimation. We reformulate the point-pixel matching problem as an optical flow estimation problem and solve the Perspective-n-Point problem based on the resulting correspondences to find the relative pose between the camera and the LiDAR point cloud. We extensively evaluate CMRNext on six different robotic platforms, including three publicly available datasets and three in-house robots. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMRNext outperforms existing approaches on both tasks and effectively generalizes to previously unseen environments and sensor setups in a zero-shot manner. We make the code and pre-trained models publicly available at http://cmrnext.cs.uni-freiburg.de .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> | None |

However, optical flow estimation on tiny robots is challenging due to limited onboard sensing and computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose EdgeFlowNet , a high-speed, low-latency dense optical flow approach for tiny autonomous mobile robots by harnessing the power of edge computing. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by deploying EdgeFlowNet on a tiny quadrotor to perform static obstacle avoidance, flight through unknown gaps and dynamic obstacle dodging. EdgeFlowNet is about 20 faster than the previous state-of-the-art approaches while improving accuracy by over 20% and using only 1.08W of power enabling advanced autonomy on palm-sized tiny mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://pear.wpi.edu/research/edgeflownet.html</p></details> | None |

In recent years, the availability of customer-level 360 cameras has made omnidirectional vision more popular, and the advance of deep learning (DL) has significantly sparked its research and applications. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review and analysis of the recent progress of DL for omnidirectional vision.

| **[Vector-Symbolic Architecture for Event-Based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08300v3)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From a perspective of feature matching, optical flow estimation for event cameras involves identifying event correspondences by comparing feature similarity across accompanying event frames. In this work, we introduces an effective and robust high-dimensional (HD) feature descriptor for event frames, utilizing Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). The topological similarity among neighboring variables within VSA contributes to the enhanced representation similarity of feature descriptors for flow-matching points, while its structured symbolic representation capacity facilitates feature fusion from both event polarities and multiple spatial scales. Based on this HD feature descriptor, we propose a novel feature matching framework for event-based optical flow, encompassing both model-based (VSA-Flow) and self-supervised learning (VSA-SM) methods. In VSA-Flow, accurate optical flow estimation validates the effectiveness of HD feature descriptors. In VSA-SM, a novel similarity maximization method based on the HD feature descriptor is proposed to learn optical flow in a self-supervised way from events alone, eliminating the need for auxiliary grayscale images. Evaluation results demonstrate that our VSA-based method achieves superior accuracy in comparison to both model-based and self-supervised learning methods on the DSEC benchmark, while remains competitive among both methods on the MVSEC benchmark. This contribution marks a significant advancement in event-based optical flow within the feature matching methodology.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ProTracker: Probabilistic Integration for Robust and Accurate Point Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03220v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose ProTracker, a novel framework for robust and accurate long-term dense tracking of arbitrary points in videos. The key idea of our method is incorporating probabilistic integration to refine multiple predictions from both optical flow and semantic features for robust short-term and long-term tracking. Specifically, we integrate optical flow estimations in a probabilistic manner, producing smooth and accurate trajectories by maximizing the likelihood of each prediction. To effectively re-localize challenging points that disappear and reappear due to occlusion, we further incorporate long-term feature correspondence into our flow predictions for continuous trajectory generation. Extensive experiments show that ProTracker achieves the state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised and self-supervised approaches, and even outperforms supervised methods on several benchmarks. Our code and model will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://michaelszj.github.io/protracker</p></details> | [Code Link](https://michaelszj.github.io/protracker) |
| **[Spatially-guided Temporal Aggregation for Robust Event-RGB Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00838v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB) data to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\% accuracy gain and a 45\% reduction in inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose (i) a novel motion description map, Bidirectional Motion field (BiM), to effectively describe non-uniform motions; (ii) a BiM-guided Flow Net (BiMFN) with Content-Aware Upsampling Network (CAUN) for precise optical flow estimation; and (iii) Knowledge Distillation for VFI-centric Flow supervision (KDVCF) to supervise the motion estimation of VFI model with VFI-centric teacher flows. The proposed VFI is called a Bidirectional Motion field-guided VFI (BiM-VFI) model. Extensive experiments show that our BiM-VFI model significantly surpasses the recent state-of-the-art VFI methods by 26% and 45% improvements in LPIPS and STLPIPS respectively, yielding interpolated frames with much fewer blurs at arbitrary time instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The last two authors are co-corresponding authors</p></details> | None |
| **[CompactFlowNet: Efficient Real-time Optical Flow Estimation on Mobile Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13273v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CompactFlowNet, the first real-time mobile neural network for optical flow prediction, which involves determining the displacement of each pixel in an initial frame relative to the corresponding pixel in a subsequent frame. Optical flow serves as a fundamental building block for various video-related tasks, such as video restoration, motion estimation, video stabilization, object tracking, action recognition, and video generation. While current state-of-the-art methods prioritize accuracy, they often overlook constraints regarding speed and memory usage. Existing light models typically focus on reducing size but still exhibit high latency, compromise significantly on quality, or are optimized for high-performance GPUs, resulting in sub-optimal performance on mobile devices. This study aims to develop a mobile-optimized optical flow model by proposing a novel mobile device-compatible architecture, as well as enhancements to the training pipeline, which optimize the model for reduced weight, low memory utilization, and increased speed while maintaining minimal error. Our approach demonstrates superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art lightweight models on the challenging KITTI and Sintel benchmarks. Furthermore, it attains a significantly accelerated inference speed, thereby yielding real-time operational efficiency on the iPhone 8, while surpassing real-time performance levels on more advanced mobile devices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GG-SSMs: Graph-Generating State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12423v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data in computer vision and time series analysis domains. However, traditional SSMs are limited by fixed, one-dimensional sequential processing, which restricts their ability to model non-local interactions in high-dimensional data. While methods like Mamba and VMamba introduce selective and flexible scanning strategies, they rely on predetermined paths, which fails to efficiently capture complex dependencies. We introduce Graph-Generating State Space Models (GG-SSMs), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by dynamically constructing graphs based on feature relationships. Using Chazelle's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, GG-SSMs adapt to the inherent data structure, enabling robust feature propagation across dynamically generated graphs and efficiently modeling complex dependencies. We validate GG-SSMs on 11 diverse datasets, including event-based eye-tracking, ImageNet classification, optical flow estimation, and six time series datasets. GG-SSMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, surpassing existing methods by significant margins. Specifically, GG-SSM attains a top-1 accuracy of 84.9% on ImageNet, outperforming prior SSMs by 1%, reducing the KITTI-15 error rate to 2.77%, and improving eye-tracking detection rates by up to 0.33% with fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that dynamic scanning based on feature relationships significantly improves SSMs' representational power and efficiency, offering a versatile tool for various applications in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Spatiotemporal Blind-Spot Network with Calibrated Flow Alignment for Self-Supervised Video Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11820v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised video denoising aims to remove noise from videos without relying on ground truth data, leveraging the video itself to recover clean frames. Existing methods often rely on simplistic feature stacking or apply optical flow without thorough analysis. This results in suboptimal utilization of both inter-frame and intra-frame information, and it also neglects the potential of optical flow alignment under self-supervised conditions, leading to biased and insufficient denoising outcomes. To this end, we first explore the practicality of optical flow in the self-supervised setting and introduce a SpatioTemporal Blind-spot Network (STBN) for global frame feature utilization. In the temporal domain, we utilize bidirectional blind-spot feature propagation through the proposed blind-spot alignment block to ensure accurate temporal alignment and effectively capture long-range dependencies. In the spatial domain, we introduce the spatial receptive field expansion module, which enhances the receptive field and improves global perception capabilities. Additionally, to reduce the sensitivity of optical flow estimation to noise, we propose an unsupervised optical flow distillation mechanism that refines fine-grained inter-frame interactions during optical flow alignment. Our method demonstrates superior performance across both synthetic and real-world video denoising datasets.

| **[Learning Normal Flow Directly From Event Neighborhoods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11284v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based motion field estimation is an important task. However, current optical flow methods face challenges: learning-based approaches, often frame-based and relying on CNNs, lack cross-domain transferability, while model-based methods, though more robust, are less accurate. To address the limitations of optical flow estimation, recent works have focused on normal flow, which can be more reliably measured in regions with limited texture or strong edges. However, existing normal flow estimators are predominantly model-based and suffer from high errors. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised point-based method for normal flow estimation that overcomes the limitations of existing event learning-based approaches. Using a local point cloud encoder, our method directly estimates per-event normal flow from raw events, offering multiple unique advantages: 1) It produces temporally and spatially sharp predictions. 2) It supports more diverse data augmentation, such as random rotation, to improve robustness across various domains. 3) It naturally supports uncertainty quantification via ensemble inference, which benefits downstream tasks. 4) It enables training and inference on undistorted data in normalized camera coordinates, improving transferability across cameras. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves better and more consistent performance than state-of-the-art methods when transferred across different datasets. Leveraging this transferability, we train our model on the union of datasets and release it for public use. Finally, we introduce an egomotion solver based on a maximum-margin problem that uses normal flow and IMU to achieve strong performance in challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TSkips: Efficiency Through Explicit Temporal Delay Connections in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16711v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their bio-inspired Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons inherently capture temporal information. This makes them well-suited for sequential tasks like processing event-based data from Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and event-based speech tasks. Harnessing the temporal capabilities of SNNs requires mitigating vanishing spikes during training, capturing spatio-temporal patterns and enhancing precise spike timing. To address these challenges, we propose TSkips, augmenting SNN architectures with forward and backward skip connections that incorporate explicit temporal delays. These connections capture long-term spatio-temporal dependencies and facilitate better spike flow over long sequences. The introduction of TSkips creates a vast search space of possible configurations, encompassing skip positions and time delay values. To efficiently navigate this search space, this work leverages training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to identify optimal network structures and corresponding delays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on four event-based datasets: DSEC-flow for optical flow estimation, DVS128 Gesture for hand gesture recognition and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) for speech recognition. Our method achieves significant improvements across these datasets: up to 18% reduction in Average Endpoint Error (AEE) on DSEC-flow, 8% increase in classification accuracy on DVS128 Gesture, and up to 8% and 16% higher classification accuracy on SHD and SSC, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking the Robustness of Optical Flow Estimation to Corruptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14865v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation is extensively used in autonomous driving and video editing. While existing models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, the robustness of these methods has been infrequently investigated. Despite some research focusing on the robustness of optical flow models against adversarial attacks, there has been a lack of studies investigating their robustness to common corruptions. Taking into account the unique temporal characteristics of optical flow, we introduce 7 temporal corruptions specifically designed for benchmarking the robustness of optical flow models, in addition to 17 classical single-image corruptions, in which advanced PSF Blur simulation method is performed. Two robustness benchmarks, KITTI-FC and GoPro-FC, are subsequently established as the first corruption robustness benchmark for optical flow estimation, with Out-Of-Domain (OOD) and In-Domain (ID) settings to facilitate comprehensive studies. Robustness metrics, Corruption Robustness Error (CRE), Corruption Robustness Error ratio (CREr), and Relative Corruption Robustness Error (RCRE) are further introduced to quantify the optical flow estimation robustness. 29 model variants from 15 optical flow methods are evaluated, yielding 10 intriguing observations, such as 1) the absolute robustness of the model is heavily dependent on the estimation performance; 2) the corruptions that diminish local information are more serious than that reduce visual effects. We also give suggestions for the design and application of optical flow models. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as a foundational resource for advancing research in robust optical flow estimation.

| **[EMatch: A Unified Framework for Event-based Optical Flow and Stereo Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21735v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have shown promise in vision applications like optical flow estimation and stereo matching, with many specialized architectures leveraging the asynchronous and sparse nature of event data. However, existing works only focus event data within the confines of task-specific domains, overlooking how tasks across the temporal and spatial domains can reinforce each other. In this paper, we reformulate event-based flow estimation and stereo matching as a unified dense correspondence matching problem, enabling us to solve both tasks within a single model by directly matching features in a shared representation space. Specifically, our method utilizes a Temporal Recurrent Network to aggregate event features across temporal or spatial domains, and a Spatial Contextual Attention to enhance knowledge transfer across event flows via temporal or spatial interactions. By utilizing a shared feature similarities module that integrates knowledge from event streams via temporal or spatial interactions, our network performs optical flow estimation from temporal event segment inputs and stereo matching from spatial event segment inputs simultaneously. We demonstrate that our unified model inherently supports multi-task fusion and cross-task transfer. Without the need for retraining for specific task, our model can effectively handle both optical flow and stereo estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p></details> |  | None |

Most methods tacking this problem rely on providing user-defined controls, such as binary masks or camera movement embeddings. In our approach we propose OnlyFlow, an approach leveraging the optical flow firstly extracted from an input video to condition the motion of generated videos. Using a text prompt and an input video, OnlyFlow allows the user to generate videos that respect the motion of the input video as well as the text prompt. This is implemented through an optical flow estimation model applied on the input video, which is then fed to a trainable optical flow encoder. The output feature maps are then injected into the text-to-video backbone model. We perform quantitative, qualitative and user preference studies to show that OnlyFlow positively compares to state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of tasks, even though OnlyFlow was not specifically trained for such tasks. OnlyFlow thus constitutes a versatile, lightweight yet efficient method for controlling motion in text-to-video generation.

In this work, we present a novel method, dubbed HMAFlow, to improve optical flow estimation in challenging scenes, particularly those involving small objects. The proposed model mainly consists of two core components: a Hierarchical Motion Field Alignment (HMA) module and a Correlation Self-Attention (CSA) module. In addition, we rebuild 4D cost volumes by employing a Multi-Scale Correlation Search (MCS) layer and replacing average pooling in common cost volumes with a search strategy utilizing multiple search ranges. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the best generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, compared with RAFT, our method achieves relative error reductions of 14.2% and 3.4% on the clean pass and final pass of the Sintel online benchmark, respectively. On the KITTI test benchmark, HMAFlow surpasses RAFT and GMA in the Fl-all metric by relative margins of 6.8% and 7.7%, respectively.

However, training of SNNs poses significant challenges due to the necessity for precise temporal and spatial credit assignment. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, whilst the most widely used method for addressing these issues, incurs high computational cost due to its temporal dependency. In this work, we propose S-TLLR, a novel three-factor temporal local learning rule inspired by the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanism, aimed at training deep SNNs on event-based learning tasks. Furthermore, S-TLLR is designed to have low memory and time complexities, which are independent of the number of time steps, rendering it suitable for online learning on low-power edge devices. To demonstrate the scalability of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive evaluations on event-based datasets spanning a wide range of applications, such as image and gesture recognition, audio classification, and optical flow estimation. In all the experiments, S-TLLR achieved high accuracy, comparable to BPTT, with a reduction in memory between $5-50\times$ and multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations between $1.3-6.6\times$.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures | None |

While data-driven optical flow estimation has obtained great success in RGB cameras, its generalization performance is seriously hindered in event cameras mainly due to the limited and biased training data. In this paper, we present a novel simulator, BlinkSim, for the fast generation of large-scale data for event-based optical flow. BlinkSim incorporates a configurable rendering engine alongside an event simulation suite. By leveraging the wealth of current 3D assets, the rendering engine enables us to automatically build up thousands of scenes with different objects, textures, and motion patterns and render very high-frequency images for realistic event data simulation. Based on BlinkSim, we construct a large training dataset and evaluation benchmark BlinkFlow that contains sufficient, diversiform, and challenging event data with optical flow ground truth. Experiments show that BlinkFlow improves the generalization performance of state-of-the-art methods by more than 40\% on average and up to 90\%. Moreover, we further propose an Event-based optical Flow transFormer (E-FlowFormer) architecture. Powered by our BlinkFlow, E-FlowFormer outperforms the SOTA methods by up to 91\% on the MVSEC dataset and 14\% on the DSEC dataset and presents the best generalization performance.

Assuming spatial continuity of 3D biological structures in well aligned EM volumes, we reasoned that optical flow estimation techniques, often applied for temporal resolution enhancement in videos, can be utilized. Pixel level motion is estimated between neighboring 2D slices along z, using spatial gradient flow estimates to interpolate and generate new 2D slices resulting in isotropic voxels. We leverage recent state-of-the-art learning methods for video frame interpolation and transfer learning techniques, and demonstrate the success of our approach on publicly available ultrastructure EM volumes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EventHDR: from Event to High-Speed HDR Videos and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17029v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are innovative neuromorphic sensors that asynchronously capture the scene dynamics. Due to the event-triggering mechanism, such cameras record event streams with much shorter response latency and higher intensity sensitivity compared to conventional cameras. On the basis of these features, previous works have attempted to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) videos from events, but have either suffered from unrealistic artifacts or failed to provide sufficiently high frame rates. In this paper, we present a recurrent convolutional neural network that reconstruct high-speed HDR videos from event sequences, with a key frame guidance to prevent potential error accumulation caused by the sparse event data. Additionally, to address the problem of severely limited real dataset, we develop a new optical system to collect a real-world dataset with paired high-speed HDR videos and event streams, facilitating future research in this field. Our dataset provides the first real paired dataset for event-to-HDR reconstruction, avoiding potential inaccuracies from simulation strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality, high-speed HDR videos. We further explore the potential of our work in cross-camera reconstruction and downstream computer vision tasks, including object detection, panoramic segmentation, optical flow estimation, and monocular depth estimation under HDR scenarios.</p></details> | TPAMI 2024 | None |
| **[TempBEV: Improving Learned BEV Encoders with Combined Image and BEV Space Temporal Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11803v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires an accurate representation of the environment. A strategy toward high accuracy is to fuse data from several sensors. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders can achieve this by mapping data from individual sensors into one joint latent space. For cost-efficient camera-only systems, this provides an effective mechanism to fuse data from multiple cameras with different views. Accuracy can further be improved by aggregating sensor information over time. This is especially important in monocular camera systems to account for the lack of explicit depth and velocity measurements. Thereby, the effectiveness of developed BEV encoders crucially depends on the operators used to aggregate temporal information and on the used latent representation spaces. We analyze BEV encoders proposed in the literature and compare their effectiveness, quantifying the effects of aggregation operators and latent representations. While most existing approaches aggregate temporal information either in image or in BEV latent space, our analyses and performance comparisons suggest that these latent representations exhibit complementary strengths. Therefore, we develop a novel temporal BEV encoder, TempBEV, which integrates aggregated temporal information from both latent spaces. We consider subsequent image frames as stereo through time and leverage methods from optical flow estimation for temporal stereo encoding. Empirical evaluation on the NuScenes dataset shows a significant improvement by TempBEV over the baseline for 3D object detection and BEV segmentation. The ablation uncovers a strong synergy of joint temporal aggregation in the image and BEV latent space. These results indicate the overall effectiveness of our approach and make a strong case for aggregating temporal information in both image and BEV latent spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> | None |

Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

The nature of videos exhibits redundant temporal cues for rain removal with higher stability. Traditional video deraining methods heavily rely on optical flow estimation and kernel-based manners, which have a limited receptive field. Yet, transformer architectures, while enabling long-term dependencies, bring about a significant increase in computational complexity. Recently, the linear-complexity operator of the state space models (SSMs) has contrarily facilitated efficient long-term temporal modeling, which is crucial for rain streaks and raindrops removal in videos. Unexpectedly, its uni-dimensional sequential process on videos destroys the local correlations across the spatio-temporal dimension by distancing adjacent pixels. To address this, we present an improved SSMs-based video deraining network (RainMamba) with a novel Hilbert scanning mechanism to better capture sequence-level local information. We also introduce a difference-guided dynamic contrastive locality learning strategy to enhance the patch-level self-similarity learning ability of the proposed network. Extensive experiments on four synthesized video deraining datasets and real-world rainy videos demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our network in the removal of rain streaks and raindrops.

However, the scarcity of datasets and a modern baseline hinders the progress in facial optical flow research. This paper proposes FacialFlowNet (FFN), a novel large-scale facial optical flow dataset, and the Decomposed Facial Flow Model (DecFlow), the first method capable of decomposing facial flow. FFN comprises 9,635 identities and 105,970 image pairs, offering unprecedented diversity for detailed facial and head motion analysis. DecFlow features a facial semantic-aware encoder and a decomposed flow decoder, excelling in accurately estimating and decomposing facial flow into head and expression components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FFN significantly enhances the accuracy of facial flow estimation across various optical flow methods, achieving up to an 11% reduction in Endpoint Error (EPE) (from 3.91 to 3.48). Moreover, DecFlow, when coupled with FFN, outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, enhancing facial expression analysis. The decomposed expression flow achieves a substantial accuracy improvement of 18% (from 69.1% to 82.1%) in micro-expressions recognition. These contributions represent a significant advancement in facial motion analysis and optical flow estimation. Codes and datasets can be found.</p></details> | ACMMM2024 | None |

State-of-the-art cameras provide this required high frame-rate and high spatial resolution together, albeit at a high cost. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a dual camera system for the generation of HSTR video using reference-based super-resolution (RefSR). One camera captures high spatial resolution low frame rate (HSLF) video while the other captures low spatial resolution high frame rate (LSHF) video simultaneously for the same scene. A novel deep learning architecture is proposed to fuse HSLF and LSHF video feeds and synthesize HSTR video frames. The proposed model combines optical flow estimation and (channel-wise and spatial) attention mechanisms to capture the fine motion and complex dependencies between frames of the two video feeds. Simulations show that the proposed model provides significant improvement over existing reference-based SR techniques in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics. The method also exhibits sufficient frames per second (FPS) for aerial monitoring when deployed on a power-constrained drone equipped with dual cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

They offer significant advantages over conventional frame-based cameras, such as a higher dynamic range and an extremely faster data rate, making them particularly useful in scenarios involving fast motion or challenging lighting conditions. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) share similar asynchronous and sparse characteristics and are well-suited for processing data from event cameras. Inspired by the potential of transformers and spike-driven transformers (spikeformers) in other computer vision tasks, we propose two solutions for fast and robust optical flow estimation for event cameras: STTFlowNet and SDformerFlow. STTFlowNet adopts a U-shaped artificial neural network (ANN) architecture with spatiotemporal shifted window self-attention (swin) transformer encoders, while SDformerFlow presents its fully spiking counterpart, incorporating swin spikeformer encoders. Furthermore, we present two variants of the spiking version with different neuron models. Our work is the first to make use of spikeformers for dense optical flow estimation. We conduct end-to-end training for all models using supervised learning. Our results yield state-of-the-art performance among SNN-based event optical flow methods on both the DSEC and MVSEC datasets, and show significant reduction in power consumption compared to the equivalent ANNs.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

It is very challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data and the temporal consistency required for obtaining convincing results. Recently, diffusion models have shown impressive results in modeling complex data distributions, including images and videos. Such models remain nonetheless very expensive to train and to perform inference with, which strongly reduce their applicability to videos, and yields unreasonable computational loads. We show that in the case of video inpainting, thanks to the highly auto-similar nature of videos, the training data of a diffusion model can be restricted to the input video and still produce very satisfying results. This leads us to adopt an internal learning approach, which also allows us to greatly reduce the neural network size by about three orders of magnitude less than current diffusion models used for image inpainting. We also introduce a new method for efficient training and inference of diffusion models in the context of internal learning, by splitting the diffusion process into different learning intervals corresponding to different noise levels of the diffusion process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first video inpainting method based purely on diffusion. Other methods require additional components such as optical flow estimation, which limits their performance in the case of dynamic textures and complex motions. We show qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating that our method reaches state of the art performance in the case of dynamic textures and complex dynamic backgrounds.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures | None |

In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow method that balances high accuracy with reduced computational demands. Building upon NeuFlow v1, we introduce new components including a much more light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module. Both these modules help in keeping the computational demands light while providing close to state of the art accuracy.

However, most existing methods focus on the network training under weak supervision, while efficient annotation strategies remain largely unexplored. To tackle this gap, we implement LiDAR semantic segmentation using scatter image annotation, effectively integrating an efficient annotation strategy with network training. Specifically, we propose employing scatter images to annotate LiDAR point clouds, combining a pre-trained optical flow estimation network with a foundation image segmentation model to rapidly propagate manual annotations into dense labels for both images and point clouds. Moreover, we propose ScatterNet, a network that includes three pivotal strategies to reduce the performance gap caused by such annotations. Firstly, it utilizes dense semantic labels as supervision for the image branch, alleviating the modality imbalance between point clouds and images. Secondly, an intermediate fusion branch is proposed to obtain multimodal texture and structural features. Lastly, a perception consistency loss is introduced to determine which information needs to be fused and which needs to be discarded during the fusion process. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets have demonstrated that our method requires less than 0.02% of the labeled points to achieve over 95% of the performance of fully-supervised methods. Notably, our labeled points are only 5% of those used in the most advanced weakly supervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous approaches have depended on supervised learning on synthetic data, which lacks interpretability and risk over-fitting to the setting of the event simulator. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) based methods, which primarily utilize per-frame optical flow to estimate intensity via photometric constancy, has been actively investigated. However, they are vulnerable to errors in the case of inaccurate optical flow. This paper proposes a novel SSL event-to-video reconstruction approach, dubbed EvINR, which eliminates the need for labeled data or optical flow estimation. Our core idea is to reconstruct intensity frames by directly addressing the event generation model, essentially a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how events are generated based on the time-varying brightness signals. Specifically, we utilize an implicit neural representation (INR), which takes in spatiotemporal coordinate $(x, y, t)$ and predicts intensity values, to represent the solution of the event generation equation. The INR, parameterized as a fully-connected Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), can be optimized with its temporal derivatives supervised by events. To make EvINR feasible for online requisites, we propose several acceleration techniques that substantially expedite the training process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our EvINR surpasses previous SSL methods by 38% w.r.t. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and is comparable or superior to SoTA supervised methods.

Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation.

From the apparent aspect, the optical flow can be viewed as the correlation between the pixels in consecutive frames, so continuously refining the correlation volume can achieve an outstanding performance. However, it will make the method have a catastrophic computational complexity. Not only that, the error caused by the occlusion regions of the successive frames will be amplified through the inaccurate warp operation. These challenges can not be solved only from the apparent view, so this paper rethinks the optical flow estimation from the kinetics viewpoint.We propose a method combining the apparent and kinetics information from this motivation. The proposed method directly predicts the optical flow from the feature extracted from images instead of building the correlation volume, which will improve the efficiency of the whole network. Meanwhile, the proposed method involves a new differentiable warp operation that simultaneously considers the warping and occlusion. Moreover, the proposed method blends the kinetics feature with the apparent feature through the novel self-supervised loss function. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies prove that the proposed novel insight into how to predict the optical flow can achieve the better performance of the state-of-the-art methods, and in some metrics, the proposed method outperforms the correlation-based method, especially in situations containing occlusion and fast moving.

Namely, we focus on integrating scene global motion knowledge to improve large-scale semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation. Prior works on VOS mostly rely on direct comparison of semantic and contextual features to perform dense matching between current and past frames, passing over actual motion structure. On the other hand, Optical Flow Estimation task aims to approximate the scene motion field, exposing global motion patterns which are typically undiscoverable during all pairs similarity search. We present WarpFormer, an architecture for semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation that exploits existing knowledge in motion understanding to conduct smoother propagation and more accurate matching. Our framework employs a generic pretrained Optical Flow Estimation network whose prediction is used to warp both past frames and instance segmentation masks to the current frame domain. Consequently, warped segmentation masks are refined and fused together aiming to inpaint occluded regions and eliminate artifacts caused by flow field imperfects. Additionally, we employ novel large-scale MOSE 2023 dataset to train model on various complex scenarios. Our method demonstrates strong performance on DAVIS 2016/2017 validation (93.0% and 85.9%), DAVIS 2017 test-dev (80.6%) and YouTube-VOS 2019 validation (83.8%) that is competitive with alternative state-of-the-art methods while using much simpler memory mechanism and instance understanding logic.</p></details> |  | None |

To facilitate research on this new task, we extend the AmodalSynthDrive dataset to include pixel-level labels for amodal optical flow estimation. We present several strong baselines, along with the Amodal Flow Quality metric to quantify the performance in an interpretable manner. Furthermore, we propose the novel AmodalFlowNet as an initial step toward addressing this task. AmodalFlowNet consists of a transformer-based cost-volume encoder paired with a recurrent transformer decoder which facilitates recurrent hierarchical feature propagation and amodal semantic grounding. We demonstrate the tractability of amodal optical flow in extensive experiments and show its utility for downstream tasks such as panoptic tracking. We make the dataset, code, and trained models publicly available at http://amodal-flow.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, correlation volumes scale poorly with resolution, prohibiting them from estimating high-resolution flow. We observe that the spatiotemporally continuous traces of events provide a natural search direction for seeking pixel correspondences, obviating the need to rely on gradients of explicit correlation volumes as such search directions. We introduce IDNet (Iterative Deblurring Network), a lightweight yet high-performing event-based optical flow network directly estimating flow from event traces without using correlation volumes. We further propose two iterative update schemes: "ID" which iterates over the same batch of events, and "TID" which iterates over time with streaming events in an online fashion. Our top-performing ID model sets a new state of the art on DSEC benchmark. Meanwhile, the base ID model is competitive with prior arts while using 80% fewer parameters, consuming 20x less memory footprint and running 40% faster on the NVidia Jetson Xavier NX. Furthermore, the TID model is even more efficient offering an additional 5x faster inference speed and 8 ms ultra-low latency at the cost of only a 9% performance drop, making it the only model among current literature capable of real-time operation while maintaining decent performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'24), Yokohama, Japan, May 13-17, 2024. arXiv revision includes additional ablation studies results</p></details> | None |

Therefore, we propose UnSAMFlow, an unsupervised flow network that also leverages object information from the latest foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM). We first include a self-supervised semantic augmentation module tailored to SAM masks. We also analyze the poor gradient landscapes of traditional smoothness losses and propose a new smoothness definition based on homography instead. A simple yet effective mask feature module has also been added to further aggregate features on the object level. With all these adaptations, our method produces clear optical flow estimation with sharp boundaries around objects, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both KITTI and Sintel datasets. Our method also generalizes well across domains and runs very efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024.

Despite substantial recent advancements, achieving real-time on-device optical flow estimation remains a complex challenge. First, an optical flow model must be sufficiently lightweight to meet computation and memory constraints to ensure real-time performance on devices. Second, the necessity for real-time on-device operation imposes constraints that weaken the model's capacity to adequately handle ambiguities in flow estimation, thereby intensifying the difficulty of preserving flow accuracy. This paper introduces two synergistic techniques, Self-Cleaning Iteration (SCI) and Regression Focal Loss (RFL), designed to enhance the capabilities of optical flow models, with a focus on addressing optical flow regression ambiguities. These techniques prove particularly effective in mitigating error propagation, a prevalent issue in optical flow models that employ iterative refinement. Notably, these techniques add negligible to zero overhead in model parameters and inference latency, thereby preserving real-time on-device efficiency. The effectiveness of our proposed SCI and RFL techniques, collectively referred to as SciFlow for brevity, is demonstrated across two distinct lightweight optical flow model architectures in our experiments. Remarkably, SciFlow enables substantial reduction in error metrics (EPE and Fl-all) over the baseline models by up to 6.3% and 10.5% for in-domain scenarios and by up to 6.2% and 13.5% for cross-domain scenarios on the Sintel and KITTI 2015 datasets, respectively.</p></details> | CVPRW 2024 | None |
| **[MemFlow: Optical Flow Estimation and Prediction with Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04808v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow is a classical task that is important to the vision community. Classical optical flow estimation uses two frames as input, whilst some recent methods consider multiple frames to explicitly model long-range information. The former ones limit their ability to fully leverage temporal coherence along the video sequence; and the latter ones incur heavy computational overhead, typically not possible for real-time flow estimation. Some multi-frame-based approaches even necessitate unseen future frames for current estimation, compromising real-time applicability in safety-critical scenarios. To this end, we present MemFlow, a real-time method for optical flow estimation and prediction with memory. Our method enables memory read-out and update modules for aggregating historical motion information in real-time. Furthermore, we integrate resolution-adaptive re-scaling to accommodate diverse video resolutions. Besides, our approach seamlessly extends to the future prediction of optical flow based on past observations. Leveraging effective historical motion aggregation, our method outperforms VideoFlow with fewer parameters and faster inference speed on Sintel and KITTI-15 datasets in terms of generalization performance. At the time of submission, MemFlow also leads in performance on the 1080p Spring dataset.

| **[$\mathrm{F^2Depth}$: Self-supervised Indoor Monocular Depth Estimation via Optical Flow Consistency and Feature Map Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18443v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods have been increasingly given much attention due to the benefit of not requiring large, labelled datasets. Such self-supervised methods require high-quality salient features and consequently suffer from severe performance drop for indoor scenes, where low-textured regions dominant in the scenes are almost indiscriminative. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised indoor monocular depth estimation framework called $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$. A self-supervised optical flow estimation network is introduced to supervise depth learning. To improve optical flow estimation performance in low-textured areas, only some patches of points with more discriminative features are adopted for finetuning based on our well-designed patch-based photometric loss. The finetuned optical flow estimation network generates high-accuracy optical flow as a supervisory signal for depth estimation. Correspondingly, an optical flow consistency loss is designed. Multi-scale feature maps produced by finetuned optical flow estimation network perform warping to compute feature map synthesis loss as another supervisory signal for depth learning. Experimental results on the NYU Depth V2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and our proposed losses. To evaluate the generalization ability of our $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$, we collect a Campus Indoor depth dataset composed of approximately 1500 points selected from 99 images in 18 scenes. Zero-shot generalization experiments on 7-Scenes dataset and Campus Indoor achieve $\delta_1$ accuracy of 75.8% and 76.0% respectively. The accuracy results show that our model can generalize well to monocular images captured in unknown indoor scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

While current methods rely on data augmentation, they have yet to fully exploit the rich information available in labeled video sequences. We propose OCAI, a method that supports robust frame interpolation by generating intermediate video frames alongside optical flows in between. Utilizing a forward warping approach, OCAI employs occlusion awareness to resolve ambiguities in pixel values and fills in missing values by leveraging the forward-backward consistency of optical flows. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student style semi-supervised learning method on top of the interpolated frames. Using a pair of unlabeled frames and the teacher model's predicted optical flow, we generate interpolated frames and flows to train a student model. The teacher's weights are maintained using Exponential Moving Averaging of the student. Our evaluations demonstrate perceptually superior interpolation quality and enhanced optical flow accuracy on established benchmarks such as Sintel and KITTI.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 | None |
| **[Periodic Vibration Gaussian: Dynamic Urban Scene Reconstruction and Real-time Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18561v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling dynamic, large-scale urban scenes is challenging due to their highly intricate geometric structures and unconstrained dynamics in both space and time. Prior methods often employ high-level architectural priors, separating static and dynamic elements, resulting in suboptimal capture of their synergistic interactions. To address this challenge, we present a unified representation model, called Periodic Vibration Gaussian (PVG). PVG builds upon the efficient 3D Gaussian splatting technique, originally designed for static scene representation, by introducing periodic vibration-based temporal dynamics. This innovation enables PVG to elegantly and uniformly represent the characteristics of various objects and elements in dynamic urban scenes. To enhance temporally coherent and large scene representation learning with sparse training data, we introduce a novel temporal smoothing mechanism and a position-aware adaptive control strategy respectively. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI benchmarks demonstrate that PVG surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis for both dynamic and static scenes. Notably, PVG achieves this without relying on manually labeled object bounding boxes or expensive optical flow estimation. Moreover, PVG exhibits 900-fold acceleration in rendering over the best alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fudan-zvg.github.io/PVG/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/PVG) |
| **[Best of Both Worlds: Hybrid SNN-ANN Architecture for Event-based Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02960v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics, event-based cameras are emerging as a promising low-power alternative to traditional frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion and high dynamic range scenes. This is due to their sparse and asynchronous event outputs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with their asynchronous event-driven compute, show great potential for extracting the spatio-temporal features from these event streams. In contrast, the standard Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) fail to process event data effectively. However, training SNNs is difficult due to additional trainable parameters (thresholds and leaks), vanishing spikes at deeper layers, and a non-differentiable binary activation function. Furthermore, an additional data structure, membrane potential, responsible for keeping track of temporal information, must be fetched and updated at every timestep in SNNs. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SNN-ANN hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of both. Specifically, we leverage the asynchronous compute capabilities of SNN layers to effectively extract the input temporal information. Concurrently, the ANN layers facilitate training and efficient hardware deployment on traditional machine learning hardware such as GPUs. We provide extensive experimental analysis for assigning each layer to be spiking or analog, leading to a network configuration optimized for performance and ease of training. We evaluate our hybrid architecture for optical flow estimation on DSEC-flow and Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event-Camera (MVSEC) datasets. On the DSEC-flow dataset, the hybrid SNN-ANN architecture achieves a 40% reduction in average endpoint error (AEE) with 22% lower energy consumption compared to Full-SNN, and 48% lower AEE compared to Full-ANN, while maintaining comparable energy usage.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Bandwidth Efficiency for Video Motion Transfer Applications using Deep Learning Based Keypoint Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11337v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deep learning based novel prediction framework for enhanced bandwidth reduction in motion transfer enabled video applications such as video conferencing, virtual reality gaming and privacy preservation for patient health monitoring. To model complex motion, we use the First Order Motion Model (FOMM) that represents dynamic objects using learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. Keypoints are extracted by a self-supervised keypoint detector and organized in a time series corresponding to the video frames. Prediction of keypoints, to enable transmission using lower frames per second on the source device, is performed using a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN). The predicted keypoints are then synthesized to video frames using an optical flow estimator and a generator network. This efficacy of leveraging keypoint based representations in conjunction with VRNN based prediction for both video animation and reconstruction is demonstrated on three diverse datasets. For real-time applications, our results show the effectiveness of our proposed architecture by enabling up to 2x additional bandwidth reduction over existing keypoint based video motion transfer frameworks without significantly compromising video quality.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent learning-based optical flow methods have achieved high accuracy, they often come with heavy computation costs. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow architecture, called NeuFlow, that addresses both high accuracy and computational cost concerns. The architecture follows a global-to-local scheme. Given the features of the input images extracted at different spatial resolutions, global matching is employed to estimate an initial optical flow on the 1/16 resolution, capturing large displacement, which is then refined on the 1/8 resolution with lightweight CNN layers for better accuracy. We evaluate our approach on Jetson Orin Nano and RTX 2080 to demonstrate efficiency improvements across different computing platforms. We achieve a notable 10x-80x speedup compared to several state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach achieves around 30 FPS on edge computing platforms, which represents a significant breakthrough in deploying complex computer vision tasks such as SLAM on small robots like drones.

Due to the specific requirements of different tasks like optical flow estimation and local feature matching, previous works are primarily categorized into dense matching and sparse feature matching focusing on specialized architectures along with task-specific datasets, which may somewhat hinder the generalization performance of specialized models. In this paper, we propose a deep model for sparse and dense matching, termed RGM (Robust Generalist Matching). In particular, we elaborately design a cascaded GRU module for refinement by exploring the geometric similarity iteratively at multiple scales following an additional uncertainty estimation module for sparsification. To narrow the gap between synthetic training samples and real-world scenarios, we build a new, large-scale dataset with sparse correspondence ground truth by generating optical flow supervision with greater intervals. As such, we are able to mix up various dense and sparse matching datasets, significantly improving the training diversity. The generalization capacity of our proposed RGM is greatly improved by learning the matching and uncertainty estimation in a two-stage manner on the large, mixed data. Superior performance is achieved for zero-shot matching and downstream geometry estimation across multiple datasets, outperforming the previous methods by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/aim-uofa/RGM</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/aim-uofa/RGM) |

However, previous learned approaches often directly extend neural P-frame codecs to B-frame relying on bi-directional optical-flow estimation or video frame interpolation. They suffer from inaccurate quantized motions and inefficient motion compensation. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure called Interpolation-driven B-frame Video Compression (IBVC). Our approach only involves two major operations: video frame interpolation and artifact reduction compression. IBVC introduces a bit-rate free MEMC based on interpolation, which avoids optical-flow quantization and additional compression distortions. Later, to reduce duplicate bit-rate consumption and focus on unaligned artifacts, a residual guided masking encoder is deployed to adaptively select the meaningful contexts with interpolated multi-scale dependencies. In addition, a conditional spatio-temporal decoder is proposed to eliminate location errors and artifacts instead of using MEMC coding in other methods. The experimental results on B-frame coding demonstrate that IBVC has significant improvements compared to the relevant state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, our approach can save bit rates compared with the random access (RA) configuration of H.266 (VTM).

| **[Flow-Based Visual Stream Compression for Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08086v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the use of neuromorphic, event-based vision sensors expands, the need for compression of their output streams has increased. While their operational principle ensures event streams are spatially sparse, the high temporal resolution of the sensors can result in high data rates from the sensor depending on scene dynamics. For systems operating in communication-bandwidth-constrained and power-constrained environments, it is essential to compress these streams before transmitting them to a remote receiver. Therefore, we introduce a flow-based method for the real-time asynchronous compression of event streams as they are generated. This method leverages real-time optical flow estimates to predict future events without needing to transmit them, therefore, drastically reducing the amount of data transmitted. The flow-based compression introduced is evaluated using a variety of methods including spatiotemporal distance between event streams. The introduced method itself is shown to achieve an average compression ratio of 2.81 on a variety of event-camera datasets with the evaluation configuration used. That compression is achieved with a median temporal error of 0.48 ms and an average spatiotemporal event-stream distance of 3.07. When combined with LZMA compression for non-real-time applications, our method can achieve state-of-the-art average compression ratios ranging from 10.45 to 17.24. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed prediction algorithm is capable of performing real-time, low-latency event prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

To solve these problems, a novel pipeline termed LHMap-loc is proposed, which achieves accurate and efficient monocular localization in LiDAR maps. Firstly, feature encoding is carried out on the original LiDAR point cloud map by generating offline heat point clouds, by which the size of the original LiDAR map is compressed.

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method to jointly learn 3D motion and depth from monocular videos. Our system contains a depth estimation module to predict depth, and a new decomposed object-wise 3D motion (DO3D) estimation module to predict ego-motion and 3D object motion. Depth and motion networks work collaboratively to faithfully model the geometry and dynamics of real-world scenes, which, in turn, benefits both depth and 3D motion estimation. Their predictions are further combined to synthesize a novel video frame for self-supervised training. As a core component of our framework, DO3D is a new motion disentanglement module that learns to predict camera ego-motion and instance-aware 3D object motion separately. To alleviate the difficulties in estimating non-rigid 3D object motions, they are decomposed to object-wise 6-DoF global transformations and a pixel-wise local 3D motion deformation field. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including KITTI, Cityscapes, and VKITTI2, where our model delivers superior performance in all evaluated settings. For the depth estimation task, our model outperforms all compared research works in the high-resolution setting, attaining an absolute relative depth error (abs rel) of 0.099 on the KITTI benchmark. Besides, our optical flow estimation results (an overall EPE of 7.09 on KITTI) also surpass state-of-the-art methods and largely improve the estimation of dynamic regions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our motion model.

They are, however, too slow in practice to track every point observed in a single frame in a reasonable amount of time. This paper introduces DOT, a novel, simple and efficient method for solving this problem. It first extracts a small set of tracks from key regions at motion boundaries using an off-the-shelf point tracking algorithm. Given source and target frames, DOT then computes rough initial estimates of a dense flow field and visibility mask through nearest-neighbor interpolation, before refining them using a learnable optical flow estimator that explicitly handles occlusions and can be trained on synthetic data with ground-truth correspondences. We show that DOT is significantly more accurate than current optical flow techniques, outperforms sophisticated "universal" trackers like OmniMotion, and is on par with, or better than, the best point tracking algorithms like CoTracker while being at least two orders of magnitude faster. Quantitative and qualitative experiments with synthetic and real videos validate the promise of the proposed approach.

Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) approaches take noisy motion estimation as input or model motion implicitly, restricting detection performance in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel Explicit Motion handling and Interactive Prompting framework for VCOD, dubbed EMIP, which handles motion cues explicitly using a frozen pre-trained optical flow fundamental model. EMIP is characterized by a two-stream architecture for simultaneously conducting camouflaged segmentation and optical flow estimation. Interactions across the dual streams are realized in an interactive prompting way that is inspired by emerging visual prompt learning. Two learnable modules, i.e. the camouflaged feeder and motion collector, are designed to incorporate segmentation-to-motion and motion-to-segmentation prompts, respectively, and enhance outputs of the both streams. The prompt fed to the motion stream is learned by supervising optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we show that long-term historical information can also be incorporated as a prompt into EMIP and achieve more robust results with temporal consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our EMIP achieves new state-of-the-art records on popular VCOD benchmarks. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

Despite the recent significant progress brought about by deep learning, most existing deep learning OFE methods still struggle to handle occlusions; in particular, those based on two frames cannot correctly handle occlusions because occluded regions have no visual correspondences. However, there is still hope in multi-frame settings, which can potentially mitigate the occlusion issue in OFE. Unfortunately, multi-frame OFE (MOFE) remains underexplored, and the limited studies on it are mainly specially designed for pyramid backbones or else obtain the aligned previous frame's features, such as correlation volume and optical flow, through time-consuming backward flow calculation or non-differentiable forward warping transformation. This study proposes an efficient MOFE framework named SplatFlow to address these shortcomings. SplatFlow introduces the differentiable splatting transformation to align the previous frame's motion feature and designs a Final-to-All embedding method to input the aligned motion feature into the current frame's estimation, thus remodeling the existing two-frame backbones. The proposed SplatFlow is efficient yet more accurate, as it can handle occlusions properly. Extensive experimental evaluations show that SplatFlow substantially outperforms all published methods on the KITTI2015 and Sintel benchmarks. Especially on the Sintel benchmark, SplatFlow achieves errors of 1.12 (clean pass) and 2.07 (final pass), with surprisingly significant 19.4% and 16.2% error reductions, respectively, from the previous best results submitted.

Traditional numerical simulation systems depend largely on the initial settings and correctness of the constructed partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite recent efforts yielding significant success in discovering data-driven PDEs with neural networks, the limitations posed by singular scenarios and the absence of local insights prevent them from performing effectively in a broader real-world context. To this end, this paper propose the universal expert module -- that is, optical flow estimation component, to capture the evolution laws of general physical processes in a data-driven fashion. To enhance local insight, we painstakingly design a finer-grained physical pipeline, since local characteristics may be influenced by various internal contextual information, which may contradict the macroscopic properties of the whole system. Further, we harness currently popular neural discrete learning to unveil the underlying important features in its latent space, this process better injects interpretability, which can help us obtain a powerful prior over these discrete random variables. We conduct extensive experiments and ablations to demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves large performance margins, compared with the existing SOTA baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Motion-Aware Video Frame Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02892v1)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video frame interpolation methodologies endeavor to create novel frames betwixt extant ones, with the intent of augmenting the video's frame frequency. However, current methods are prone to image blurring and spurious artifacts in challenging scenarios involving occlusions and discontinuous motion. Moreover, they typically rely on optical flow estimation, which adds complexity to modeling and computational costs. To address these issues, we introduce a Motion-Aware Video Frame Interpolation (MA-VFI) network, which directly estimates intermediate optical flow from consecutive frames by introducing a novel hierarchical pyramid module. It not only extracts global semantic relationships and spatial details from input frames with different receptive fields, enabling the model to capture intricate motion patterns, but also effectively reduces the required computational cost and complexity. Subsequently, a cross-scale motion structure is presented to estimate and refine intermediate flow maps by the extracted features. This approach facilitates the interplay between input frame features and flow maps during the frame interpolation process and markedly heightens the precision of the intervening flow delineations. Finally, a discerningly fashioned loss centered around an intermediate flow is meticulously contrived, serving as a deft rudder to skillfully guide the prognostication of said intermediate flow, thereby substantially refining the precision of the intervening flow mappings. Experiments illustrate that MA-VFI surpasses several representative VFI methods across various datasets, and can enhance efficiency while maintaining commendable efficacy.</p></details> |  | None |

Tracking-by-detection has long been a dominant paradigm for object tracking of specific object categories. Recently, large-scale pre-trained models have shown promising advances in detecting and segmenting objects and parts in 2D static images in the wild. This begs the question: can we re-purpose these large-scale pre-trained static image models for open-vocabulary video tracking? In this paper, we re-purpose an open-vocabulary detector, segmenter, and dense optical flow estimator, into a model that tracks and segments objects of any category in 2D videos. Our method predicts object and part tracks with associated language descriptions in monocular videos, rebuilding the pipeline of Tractor with modern large pre-trained models for static image detection and segmentation: we detect open-vocabulary object instances and propagate their boxes from frame to frame using a flow-based motion model, refine the propagated boxes with the box regression module of the visual detector, and prompt an open-world segmenter with the refined box to segment the objects. We decide the termination of an object track based on the objectness score of the propagated boxes, as well as forward-backward optical flow consistency. We re-identify objects across occlusions using deep feature matching. We show that our model achieves strong performance on multiple established video object segmentation and tracking benchmarks, and can produce reasonable tracks in manipulation data. In particular, our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art in UVO and BURST, benchmarks for open-world object tracking and segmentation, despite never being explicitly trained for tracking. We hope that our approach can serve as a simple and extensible framework for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://wenhsuanchu.github.io/ovtracktor/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://wenhsuanchu.github.io/ovtracktor) |

Recently, detector-free methods present generally better performance but are not satisfactory in image pairs with large scale differences. In this paper, we propose Patch Area Transportation with Subdivision (PATS) to tackle this issue. Instead of building an expensive image pyramid, we start by splitting the original image pair into equal-sized patches and gradually resizing and subdividing them into smaller patches with the same scale. However, estimating scale differences between these patches is non-trivial since the scale differences are determined by both relative camera poses and scene structures, and thus spatially varying over image pairs. Moreover, it is hard to obtain the ground truth for real scenes. To this end, we propose patch area transportation, which enables learning scale differences in a self-supervised manner. In contrast to bipartite graph matching, which only handles one-to-one matching, our patch area transportation can deal with many-to-many relationships. PATS improves both matching accuracy and coverage, and shows superior performance in downstream tasks, such as relative pose estimation, visual localization, and optical flow estimation.

We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in the reference frame but not in the next. Estimating the motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame setting. Previous work only used the current frame as the only input, which could not guarantee providing correct global reference information for occluded points, and had problems such as long calculation time and poor accuracy in predicting optical flow at occluded points. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, We fully mine and utilize the spatiotemporal information provided by the frame pair, design a loopback judgment algorithm to ensure that correct global reference information is obtained, mine multiple necessary global information, and design an efficient refinement module that fuses these global information. Specifically, we propose a YOIO framework, which consists of three main components: an initial flow estimator, a multiple global information extraction module, and a unified refinement module. We demonstrate that optical flow estimates in the occluded regions can be significantly improved in only one iteration without damaging the performance in non-occluded regions. Compared with GMA, the optical flow prediction accuracy of this method in the occluded area is improved by more than 10%, and the occ_out area exceeds 15%, while the calculation time is 27% shorter. This approach, running up to 18.9fps with 436*1024 image resolution, obtains new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel dataset among all published and unpublished approaches that can run in real-time, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2104.02409 by other authors</p></details> | None |

An efficient network should skip iterations when the flow improvement is limited. In this paper, we develop a Context-Aware Iteration Policy Network for efficient optical flow estimation, which determines the optimal number of iterations per sample. The policy network achieves this by learning contextual information to realize whether flow improvement is bottlenecked or minimal. On the one hand, we use iteration embedding and historical hidden cell, which include previous iterations information, to convey how flow has changed from previous iterations. On the other hand, we use the incremental loss to make the policy network implicitly perceive the magnitude of optical flow improvement in the subsequent iteration. Furthermore, the computational complexity in our dynamic network is controllable, allowing us to satisfy various resource preferences with a single trained model. Our policy network can be easily integrated into state-of-the-art optical flow networks. Extensive experiments show that our method maintains performance while reducing FLOPs by about 40%/20% for the Sintel/KITTI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024,...</summary><p>2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |

A shortage of datasets significantly constrains the real-world performance of optical flow models. Building virtual datasets that resemble real scenarios offers a potential solution for performance enhancement, yet a domain gap separates virtual and real datasets. This paper introduces FlowDA, an unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) framework for optical flow estimation. FlowDA employs a UDA architecture based on mean-teacher and integrates concepts and techniques in unsupervised optical flow estimation. Furthermore, an Adaptive Curriculum Weighting (ACW) module based on curriculum learning is proposed to enhance the training effectiveness. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that our FlowDA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised optical flow estimation method SMURF by 21.6%, real optical flow dataset generation method MPI-Flow by 27.8%, and optical flow estimation adaptive method FlowSupervisor by 30.9%, offering novel insights for enhancing the performance of optical flow estimation in real-world scenarios.

We propose a novel end-to-end approach that leverages the learning of dense pixel-wise flow fields in pairs of ground and satellite images to calculate the camera pose. Our approach differs from existing methods by constructing the feature metric at the pixel level, enabling full-image supervision for learning distinctive geometric configurations and visual appearances across views. Specifically, our method employs two distinct convolution networks for ground and satellite feature extraction. Then, we project the ground feature map to the bird's eye view (BEV) using a fixed camera height assumption to achieve preliminary geometric alignment. To further establish content association between the BEV and satellite features, we introduce a residual convolution block to refine the projected BEV feature. Optical flow estimation is performed on the refined BEV feature map and the satellite feature map using flow decoder networks based on RAFT. After obtaining dense flow correspondences, we apply the least square method to filter matching inliers and regress the ground camera pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach reduces the median localization error by 89%, 19%, 80% and 35% on the KITTI, Ford multi-AV, VIGOR and Oxford RobotCar datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the limitation of model structures and training datasets, existing methods often rely too much on local clues and ignore the integrity of objects, resulting in fragmented motion estimation. Through theoretical analysis, we find the pre-trained large vision models are helpful in optical flow estimation, and we notice that the recently famous Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates a strong ability to segment complete objects, which is suitable for solving the fragmentation problem. We thus propose a solution to embed the frozen SAM image encoder into FlowFormer to enhance object perception. To address the challenge of in-depth utilizing SAM in non-segmentation tasks like optical flow estimation, we propose an Optical Flow Task-Specific Adaption scheme, including a Context Fusion Module to fuse the SAM encoder with the optical flow context encoder, and a Context Adaption Module to adapt the SAM features for optical flow task with Learned Task-Specific Embedding. Our proposed SAMFlow model reaches 0.86/2.10 clean/final EPE and 3.55/12.32 EPE/F1-all on Sintel and KITTI-15 training set, surpassing Flowformer by 8.5%/9.9% and 13.2%/16.3%.

It is widely utilized in video segmentation tasks. However, existing optical flow-based methods have a significant dependency on optical flow, which results in poor performance when the optical flow estimation fails for a particular scene. The temporal consistency provided by the optical flow could be effectively supplemented by modeling in a structural form. This paper proposes a new hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) architecture, dubbed hierarchical graph pattern understanding (HGPU), for zero-shot video object segmentation (ZS-VOS). Inspired by the strong ability of GNNs in capturing structural relations, HGPU innovatively leverages motion cues (\ie, optical flow) to enhance the high-order representations from the neighbors of target frames. Specifically, a hierarchical graph pattern encoder with message aggregation is introduced to acquire different levels of motion and appearance features in a sequential manner. Furthermore, a decoder is designed for hierarchically parsing and understanding the transformed multi-modal contexts to achieve more accurate and robust results. HGPU achieves state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available benchmarks (DAVIS-16, YouTube-Objects, Long-Videos and DAVIS-17).

We show that they also excel in estimating optical flow and monocular depth, surprisingly, without task-specific architectures and loss functions that are predominant for these tasks. Compared to the point estimates of conventional regression-based methods, diffusion models also enable Monte Carlo inference, e.g., capturing uncertainty and ambiguity in flow and depth. With self-supervised pre-training, the combined use of synthetic and real data for supervised training, and technical innovations (infilling and step-unrolled denoising diffusion training) to handle noisy-incomplete training data, and a simple form of coarse-to-fine refinement, one can train state-of-the-art diffusion models for depth and optical flow estimation. Extensive experiments focus on quantitative performance against benchmarks, ablations, and the model's ability to capture uncertainty and multimodality, and impute missing values. Our model, DDVM (Denoising Diffusion Vision Model), obtains a state-of-the-art relative depth error of 0.074 on the indoor NYU benchmark and an Fl-all outlier rate of 3.26\% on the KITTI optical flow benchmark, about 25\% better than the best published method.

Most of the existing state of the art deep architectures either uses a correlation oepration to match features from them.

Also, we as humans look at moving objects as whole, something which cannot be encoded by correlation or spatio temporal features. Capsules, on the other hand, are specialized to model seperate entities and their pose as a continuous matrix. Thus, we show that a simpler linear operation over poses of the objects detected by the capsules in enough to model flow.

Because of these properties, they are well-suited for processing fast motions that require rapid reactions. Although event cameras have recently shown competitive performance in unsupervised optical flow estimation, performance in detecting independently moving objects (IMOs) is lacking behind, although event-based methods would be suited for this task based on their low latency and HDR properties. Previous approaches to event-based IMO segmentation have been heavily dependent on labeled data. However, biological vision systems have developed the ability to avoid moving objects through daily tasks without being given explicit labels. In this work, we propose the first event framework that generates IMO pseudo-labels using geometric constraints. Due to its unsupervised nature, our method can handle an arbitrary number of not predetermined objects and is easily scalable to datasets where expensive IMO labels are not readily available. We evaluate our approach on the EVIMO dataset and show that it performs competitively with supervised methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StreamFlow: Streamlined Multi-Frame Optical Flow Estimation for Video Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17099v1)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occlusions between consecutive frames have long posed a significant challenge in optical flow estimation. The inherent ambiguity introduced by occlusions directly violates the brightness constancy constraint and considerably hinders pixel-to-pixel matching. To address this issue, multi-frame optical flow methods leverage adjacent frames to mitigate the local ambiguity. Nevertheless, prior multi-frame methods predominantly adopt recursive flow estimation, resulting in a considerable computational overlap. In contrast, we propose a streamlined in-batch framework that eliminates the need for extensive redundant recursive computations while concurrently developing effective spatio-temporal modeling approaches under in-batch estimation constraints. Specifically, we present a Streamlined In-batch Multi-frame (SIM) pipeline tailored to video input, attaining a similar level of time efficiency to two-frame networks. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient Integrative Spatio-temporal Coherence (ISC) modeling method for effective spatio-temporal modeling during the encoding phase, which introduces no additional parameter overhead. Additionally, we devise a Global Temporal Regressor (GTR) that effectively explores temporal relations during decoding. Benefiting from the efficient SIM pipeline and effective modules, StreamFlow not only excels in terms of performance on the challenging KITTI and Sintel datasets, with particular improvement in occluded areas but also attains a remarkable $63.82\%$ enhancement in speed compared with previous multi-frame methods.

Along with scene object information, visual stimulation can be primarily indicated by optical flow, which characterizes the motion pattern, such as the intensity and direction of the moving image. We estimated the real time optical flow in 360-degree videos targeted at immersive user interactive visualization based on the user's current viewport. The proposed method allows the estimation of customized visual flow for each experience of dynamic 360-degree videos and is an improvement over previous methods that consider a single optical flow value for the entire equirectangular frame. We applied our method to modulate the opacity of granulated rest frames (GRFs), a technique consisting of visual noise-like randomly distributed visual references that are stable to the user's body during immersive pre-recorded 360-degree video experience. We report the results of a pilot one-session between-subject study with 18 participants, where users watched a 2-minute high-intensity 360-degree video. The results show that our proposed method successfully estimates optical flow, with pilot data showing that GRFs combined with real-time optical flow estimation may improve user comfort when watching 360-degree videos. However, more data are needed for statistically significant results.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite extensive research in cognitive neuroscience, image-computable models that can extract informative motion flow from natural scenes in a manner consistent with human visual processing have yet to be established. Meanwhile, recent advancements in computer vision (CV), propelled by deep learning, have led to significant progress in optical flow estimation, a task closely related to motion perception. Here we propose an image-computable model of human motion perception by bridging the gap between biological and CV models. Specifically, we introduce a novel two-stages approach that combines trainable motion energy sensing with a recurrent self-attention network for adaptive motion integration and segregation. This model architecture aims to capture the computations in V1-MT, the core structure for motion perception in the biological visual system, while providing the ability to derive informative motion flow for a wide range of stimuli, including complex natural scenes. In silico neurophysiology reveals that our model's unit responses are similar to mammalian neural recordings regarding motion pooling and speed tuning. The proposed model can also replicate human responses to a range of stimuli examined in past psychophysical studies. The experimental results on the Sintel benchmark demonstrate that our model predicts human responses better than the ground truth, whereas the state-of-the-art CV models show the opposite. Our study provides a computational architecture consistent with human visual motion processing, although the physiological correspondence may not be exact.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2023</p></details> | None |

However, due to their complexity, such concepts have been mainly restricted to coarse-resolution single-scale approaches that fail to provide the detailed outcome of high-resolution multi-scale networks. In this paper, we hence propose CCMR: a high-resolution coarse-to-fine approach that leverages attention-based motion grouping concepts to multi-scale optical flow estimation. CCMR relies on a hierarchical two-step attention-based context-motion grouping strategy that first computes global multi-scale context features and then uses them to guide the actual motion grouping. As we iterate both steps over all coarse-to-fine scales, we adapt cross covariance image transformers to allow for an efficient realization while maintaining scale-dependent properties. Experiments and ablations demonstrate that our efforts of combining multi-scale and attention-based concepts pay off. By providing highly detailed flow fields with strong improvements in both occluded and non-occluded regions, our CCMR approach not only outperforms both the corresponding single-scale attention-based and multi-scale attention-free baselines by up to 23.0% and 21.6%, respectively, it also achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first on KITTI 2015 and second on MPI Sintel Clean and Final.

Grounded in neural fields, EmerNeRF simultaneously captures scene geometry, appearance, motion, and semantics via self-bootstrapping. EmerNeRF hinges upon two core components: First, it stratifies scenes into static and dynamic fields. This decomposition emerges purely from self-supervision, enabling our model to learn from general, in-the-wild data sources. Second, EmerNeRF parameterizes an induced flow field from the dynamic field and uses this flow field to further aggregate multi-frame features, amplifying the rendering precision of dynamic objects. Coupling these three fields (static, dynamic, and flow) enables EmerNeRF to represent highly-dynamic scenes self-sufficiently, without relying on ground truth object annotations or pre-trained models for dynamic object segmentation or optical flow estimation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in sensor simulation, significantly outperforming previous methods when reconstructing static (+2.93 PSNR) and dynamic (+3.70 PSNR) scenes. In addition, to bolster EmerNeRF's semantic generalization, we lift 2D visual foundation model features into 4D space-time and address a general positional bias in modern Transformers, significantly boosting 3D perception performance (e.g., 37.50% relative improvement in occupancy prediction accuracy on average).

Walking sticks used by them can only give them information about the obstacles in the stick's proximity. Moreover, it is mostly effective in static or very slow-paced environments. Hence, this paper introduces a method to guide them in a busy street. To create such a system it is very important to know about the approaching object and its direction of approach. To achieve this objective we created a method in which the image frame received from the video is divided into three parts i.e. center, left, and right to know the direction of approach of the approaching object. Object detection is done using YOLOv3. Lucas Kanade's optical flow estimation method is used for the optical flow estimation and Depth-net is used for depth estimation. Using the depth information, object motion trajectory, and object category information, the model provides necessary information/warning to the person.

| **[Towards Anytime Optical Flow Estimation with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05033v2)** | 2023-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation is a fundamental task in the field of autonomous driving. Event cameras are capable of responding to log-brightness changes in microseconds. Its characteristic of producing responses only to the changing region is particularly suitable for optical flow estimation. In contrast to the super low-latency response speed of event cameras, existing datasets collected via event cameras, however, only provide limited frame rate optical flow ground truth, (e.g., at 10Hz), greatly restricting the potential of event-driven optical flow. To address this challenge, we put forward a high-frame-rate, low-latency event representation Unified Voxel Grid, sequentially fed into the network bin by bin. We then propose EVA-Flow, an EVent-based Anytime Flow estimation network to produce high-frame-rate event optical flow with only low-frame-rate optical flow ground truth for supervision. The key component of our EVA-Flow is the stacked Spatiotemporal Motion Refinement (SMR) module, which predicts temporally dense optical flow and enhances the accuracy via spatial-temporal motion refinement. The time-dense feature warping utilized in the SMR module provides implicit supervision for the intermediate optical flow. Additionally, we introduce the Rectified Flow Warp Loss (RFWL) for the unsupervised evaluation of intermediate optical flow in the absence of ground truth. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work focusing on anytime optical flow estimation via event cameras. A comprehensive variety of experiments on MVSEC, DESC, and our EVA-FlowSet demonstrates that EVA-Flow achieves competitive performance, super-low-latency (5ms), fastest inference (9.2ms), time-dense motion estimation (200Hz), and strong generalization.

In this contribution, we present a holistic approach that derives velocity and wall-shear stress fields with impressive spatial and temporal resolution from flow measurements using a deep optical flow estimator with physical knowledge. The validity and physical correctness of the derived flow quantities is demonstrated with synthetic and real-world experimental data covering a range of relevant fluid flows.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Event-based Temporally Dense Optical Flow Estimation with Sequential Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01244v2)** | 2023-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras provide an advantage over traditional frame-based cameras when capturing fast-moving objects without a motion blur. They achieve this by recording changes in light intensity (known as events), thus allowing them to operate at a much higher frequency and making them suitable for capturing motions in a highly dynamic scene. Many recent studies have proposed methods to train neural networks (NNs) for predicting optical flow from events. However, they often rely on a spatio-temporal representation constructed from events over a fixed interval, such as 10Hz used in training on the DSEC dataset. This limitation restricts the flow prediction to the same interval (10Hz) whereas the fast speed of event cameras, which can operate up to 3kHz, has not been effectively utilized. In this work, we show that a temporally dense flow estimation at 100Hz can be achieved by treating the flow estimation as a sequential problem using two different variants of recurrent networks - Long-short term memory (LSTM) and spiking neural network (SNN). First, We utilize the NN model constructed similar to the popular EV-FlowNet but with LSTM layers to demonstrate the efficiency of our training method. The model not only produces 10x more frequent optical flow than the existing ones, but the estimated flows also have 13% lower errors than predictions from the baseline EV-FlowNet. Second, we construct an EV-FlowNet SNN but with leaky integrate and fire neurons to efficiently capture the temporal dynamics. We found that simple inherent recurrent dynamics of SNN lead to significant parameter reduction compared to the LSTM model. In addition, because of its event-driven computation, the spiking model is estimated to consume only 1.5% energy of the LSTM model, highlighting the efficiency of SNN in processing events and the potential for achieving temporally dense flow.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Skin the sheep not only once: Reusing Various Depth Datasets to Drive the Learning of Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01833v1)** | 2023-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation is crucial for various applications in vision and robotics. As the difficulty of collecting ground truth optical flow in real-world scenarios, most of the existing methods of learning optical flow still adopt synthetic dataset for supervised training or utilize photometric consistency across temporally adjacent video frames to drive the unsupervised learning, where the former typically has issues of generalizability while the latter usually performs worse than the supervised ones. To tackle such challenges, we propose to leverage the geometric connection between optical flow estimation and stereo matching (based on the similarity upon finding pixel correspondences across images) to unify various real-world depth estimation datasets for generating supervised training data upon optical flow. Specifically, we turn the monocular depth datasets into stereo ones via synthesizing virtual disparity, thus leading to the flows along the horizontal direction; moreover, we introduce virtual camera motion into stereo data to produce additional flows along the vertical direction. Furthermore, we propose applying geometric augmentations on one image of an optical flow pair, encouraging the optical flow estimator to learn from more challenging cases. Lastly, as the optical flow maps under different geometric augmentations actually exhibit distinct characteristics, an auxiliary classifier which trains to identify the type of augmentation from the appearance of the flow map is utilized to further enhance the learning of the optical flow estimator. Our proposed method is general and is not tied to any particular flow estimator, where extensive experiments based on various datasets and optical flow estimation models verify its efficacy and superiority.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FocusFlow: Boosting Key-Points Optical Flow Estimation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07104v2)** | 2023-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key-point-based scene understanding is fundamental for autonomous driving applications. At the same time, optical flow plays an important role in many vision tasks. However, due to the implicit bias of equal attention on all points, classic data-driven optical flow estimation methods yield less satisfactory performance on key points, limiting their implementations in key-point-critical safety-relevant scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a points-based modeling method that requires the model to learn key-point-related priors explicitly. Based on the modeling method, we present FocusFlow, a framework consisting of 1) a mix loss function combined with a classic photometric loss function and our proposed Conditional Point Control Loss (CPCL) function for diverse point-wise supervision; 2) a conditioned controlling model which substitutes the conventional feature encoder by our proposed Condition Control Encoder (CCE). CCE incorporates a Frame Feature Encoder (FFE) that extracts features from frames, a Condition Feature Encoder (CFE) that learns to control the feature extraction behavior of FFE from input masks containing information of key points, and fusion modules that transfer the controlling information between FFE and CFE. Our FocusFlow framework shows outstanding performance with up to +44.5% precision improvement on various key points such as ORB, SIFT, and even learning-based SiLK, along with exceptional scalability for most existing data-driven optical flow methods like PWC-Net, RAFT, and FlowFormer. Notably, FocusFlow yields competitive or superior performances rivaling the original models on the whole frame.

| **[MPI-Flow: Learning Realistic Optical Flow with Multiplane Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06714v1)** | 2023-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of learning-based optical flow estimation models heavily relies on the realism of the training datasets. Current approaches for generating such datasets either employ synthetic data or generate images with limited realism. However, the domain gap of these data with real-world scenes constrains the generalization of the trained model to real-world applications. To address this issue, we investigate generating realistic optical flow datasets from real-world images. Firstly, to generate highly realistic new images, we construct a layered depth representation, known as multiplane images (MPI), from single-view images. This allows us to generate novel view images that are highly realistic. To generate optical flow maps that correspond accurately to the new image, we calculate the optical flows of each plane using the camera matrix and plane depths. We then project these layered optical flows into the output optical flow map with volume rendering. Secondly, to ensure the realism of motion, we present an independent object motion module that can separate the camera and dynamic object motion in MPI. This module addresses the deficiency in MPI-based single-view methods, where optical flow is generated only by camera motion and does not account for any object movement. We additionally devise a depth-aware inpainting module to merge new images with dynamic objects and address unnatural motion occlusions. We show the superior performance of our method through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Moreover, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unsupervised and supervised training of learning-based models.

| **[Joint Self-supervised Depth and Optical Flow Estimation towards Dynamic Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00011v1)** | 2023-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant attention has been attracted to deep learning-based depth estimates. Dynamic objects become the most hard problems in inter-frame-supervised depth estimates due to the uncertainty in adjacent frames. Thus, integrating optical flow information with depth estimation is a feasible solution, as the optical flow is an essential motion representation. In this work, we construct a joint inter-frame-supervised depth and optical flow estimation framework, which predicts depths in various motions by minimizing pixel wrap errors in bilateral photometric re-projections and optical vectors. For motion segmentation, we adaptively segment the preliminary estimated optical flow map with large areas of connectivity. In self-supervised depth estimation, different motion regions are predicted independently and then composite into a complete depth. Further, the pose and depth estimations re-synthesize the optical flow maps, serving to compute reconstruction errors with the preliminary predictions. Our proposed joint depth and optical flow estimation outperforms existing depth estimators on the KITTI Depth dataset, both with and without Cityscapes pretraining. Additionally, our optical flow results demonstrate competitive performance on the KITTI Flow 2015 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

To facilitate task-agnostic domain adaptation and the training of task-specific components, we introduce a bidirectional feature warping module that handles both left-right and forward-backward directions. Experimental results show competitive performance over previous domain translation-based methods, which substantiate the efficacy of our proposed framework, effectively leveraging the benefits of unsupervised domain adaptation, stereo matching, and optical flow estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2023</p></details> | None |
| **[AccFlow: Backward Accumulation for Long-Range Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13133v1)** | 2023-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning-based optical flow estimators have exhibited impressive performance in generating local flows between consecutive frames. However, the estimation of long-range flows between distant frames, particularly under complex object deformation and large motion occlusion, remains a challenging task. One promising solution is to accumulate local flows explicitly or implicitly to obtain the desired long-range flow. Nevertheless, the accumulation errors and flow misalignment can hinder the effectiveness of this approach. This paper proposes a novel recurrent framework called AccFlow, which recursively backward accumulates local flows using a deformable module called as AccPlus. In addition, an adaptive blending module is designed along with AccPlus to alleviate the occlusion effect by backward accumulation and rectify the accumulation error. Notably, we demonstrate the superiority of backward accumulation over conventional forward accumulation, which to the best of our knowledge has not been explicitly established before. To train and evaluate the proposed AccFlow, we have constructed a large-scale high-quality dataset named CVO, which provides ground-truth optical flow labels between adjacent and distant frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AccFlow in handling long-range optical flow estimation.

| **[MGMAE: Motion Guided Masking for Video Masked Autoencoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10794v1)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked autoencoding has shown excellent performance on self-supervised video representation learning. Temporal redundancy has led to a high masking ratio and customized masking strategy in VideoMAE. In this paper, we aim to further improve the performance of video masked autoencoding by introducing a motion guided masking strategy. Our key insight is that motion is a general and unique prior in video, which should be taken into account during masked pre-training. Our motion guided masking explicitly incorporates motion information to build temporal consistent masking volume. Based on this masking volume, we can track the unmasked tokens in time and sample a set of temporal consistent cubes from videos. These temporal aligned unmasked tokens will further relieve the information leakage issue in time and encourage the MGMAE to learn more useful structure information. We implement our MGMAE with an online efficient optical flow estimator and backward masking map warping strategy. We perform experiments on the datasets of Something-Something V2 and Kinetics-400, demonstrating the superior performance of our MGMAE to the original VideoMAE. In addition, we provide the visualization analysis to illustrate that our MGMAE can sample temporal consistent cubes in a motion-adaptive manner for more effective video pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2023 camera-ready version</p></details> | None |
| **[TMA: Temporal Motion Aggregation for Event-based Optical Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11629v2)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have the ability to record continuous and detailed trajectories of objects with high temporal resolution, thereby providing intuitive motion cues for optical flow estimation. Nevertheless, most existing learning-based approaches for event optical flow estimation directly remould the paradigm of conventional images by representing the consecutive event stream as static frames, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of event data. In this paper, we argue that temporal continuity is a vital element of event-based optical flow and propose a novel Temporal Motion Aggregation (TMA) approach to unlock its potential. Technically, TMA comprises three components: an event splitting strategy to incorporate intermediate motion information underlying the temporal context, a linear lookup strategy to align temporally fine-grained motion features and a novel motion pattern aggregation module to emphasize consistent patterns for motion feature enhancement. By incorporating temporally fine-grained motion information, TMA can derive better flow estimates than existing methods at early stages, which not only enables TMA to obtain more accurate final predictions, but also greatly reduces the demand for a number of refinements. Extensive experiments on DSEC-Flow and MVSEC datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our TMA. Remarkably, compared to E-RAFT, TMA achieves a 6\% improvement in accuracy and a 40\% reduction in inference time on DSEC-Flow.
