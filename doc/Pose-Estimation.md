Though existing methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often exhibit limitations due to constrained dataset diversity and the restricted amount of information derived from audio inputs. To address these challenges, we present VarGes, a novel variation-driven framework designed to enhance co-speech gesture generation by integrating visual stylistic cues while maintaining naturalness. Our approach begins with the Variation-Enhanced Feature Extraction (VEFE) module, which seamlessly incorporates \textcolor{blue}{style-reference} video data into a 3D human pose estimation network to extract StyleCLIPS, thereby enriching the input with stylistic information. Subsequently, we employ the Variation-Compensation Style Encoder (VCSE), a transformer-style encoder equipped with an additive attention mechanism pooling layer, to robustly encode diverse StyleCLIPS representations and effectively manage stylistic variations. Finally, the Variation-Driven Gesture Predictor (VDGP) module fuses MFCC audio features with StyleCLIPS encodings via cross-attention, injecting this fused data into a cross-conditional autoregressive model to modulate 3D human gesture generation based on audio input and stylistic clues. The efficacy of our approach is validated on benchmark datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of gesture diversity and naturalness. The code and video results will be made publicly available upon acceptance:https://github.com/mookerr/VarGES/ .</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/mookerr/VarGES) |
| **[Spatiotemporal Multi-Camera Calibration using Freely Moving People](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12546v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for spatiotemporal multi-camera calibration using freely moving people in multiview videos. Since calibrating multiple cameras and finding matches across their views are inherently interdependent, performing both in a unified framework poses a significant challenge. We address these issues as a single registration problem of matching two sets of 3D points, leveraging human motion in dynamic multi-person scenes. To this end, we utilize 3D human poses obtained from an off-the-shelf monocular 3D human pose estimator and transform them into 3D points on a unit sphere, to solve the rotation, time offset, and the association alternatingly. We employ a probabilistic approach that can jointly solve both problems of aligning spatiotemporal data and establishing correspondences through soft assignment between two views. The translation is determined by applying coplanarity constraints. The pairwise registration results are integrated into a multiview setup, and then a nonlinear optimization method is used to improve the accuracy of the camera poses, temporal offsets, and multi-person associations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method as a practical marker-free calibration tool.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Learning Transformation-Isomorphic Latent Space for Accurate Hand Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12535v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based regression tasks, such as hand pose estimation, have achieved higher accuracy and faster convergence through representation learning. However, existing representation learning methods often encounter the following issues: the high semantic level of features extracted from images is inadequate for regressing low-level information, and the extracted features include task-irrelevant information, reducing their compactness and interfering with regression tasks. To address these challenges, we propose TI-Net, a highly versatile visual Network backbone designed to construct a Transformation Isomorphic latent space. Specifically, we employ linear transformations to model geometric transformations in the latent space and ensure that {\rm TI-Net} aligns them with those in the image space. This ensures that the latent features capture compact, low-level information beneficial for pose estimation tasks. We evaluated TI-Net on the hand pose estimation task to demonstrate the network's superiority. On the DexYCB dataset, TI-Net achieved a 10% improvement in the PA-MPJPE metric compared to specialized state-of-the-art (SOTA) hand pose estimation methods. Our code will be released in the future.</p></details> |  | None |

Our solution features a cascaded learning paradigm with camera pose serving as the critical bridge, recognizing its essential role in mapping 3D structures onto 2D image planes. Concretely, FLARE starts with camera pose estimation, whose results condition the subsequent learning of geometric structure and appearance, optimized through the objectives of geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis. Utilizing large-scale public datasets for training, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance in the tasks of pose estimation, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis, while maintaining the inference efficiency (i.e., less than 0.5 seconds).

| **[Enhancing Transparent Object Pose Estimation: A Fusion of GDR-Net and Edge Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12027v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation of transparent objects remains a challenging task in the field of robot vision due to the immense influence of lighting, background, and reflections. However, the edges of clear objects have the highest contrast, which leads to stable and prominent features. We propose a novel approach by incorporating edge detection in a pre-processing step for the tasks of object detection and object pose estimation. We conducted experiments to investigate the effect of edge detectors on transparent objects. We examine the performance of the state-of-the-art 6D object pose estimation pipeline GDR-Net and the object detector YOLOX when applying different edge detectors as pre-processing steps (i.e., Canny edge detection with and without color information, and holistically-nested edges (HED)). We evaluate the physically-based rendered dataset Trans6D-32 K of transparent objects with parameters proposed by the BOP Challenge. Our results indicate that applying edge detection as a pre-processing enhances performance for certain objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at First Austrian Symposium on AI, Robotics, and Vision (AIROV 2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[X-Fi: A Modality-Invariant Foundation Model for Multimodal Human Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10167v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SurgPose: a Dataset for Articulated Robotic Surgical Tool Pose Estimation and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11534v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient surgical robotic tool pose estimation is of fundamental significance to downstream applications such as augmented reality (AR) in surgical training and learning-based autonomous manipulation. While significant advancements have been made in pose estimation for humans and animals, it is still a challenge in surgical robotics due to the scarcity of published data. The relatively large absolute error of the da Vinci end effector kinematics and arduous calibration procedure make calibrated kinematics data collection expensive. Driven by this limitation, we collected a dataset, dubbed SurgPose, providing instance-aware semantic keypoints and skeletons for visual surgical tool pose estimation and tracking. By marking keypoints using ultraviolet (UV) reactive paint, which is invisible under white light and fluorescent under UV light, we execute the same trajectory under different lighting conditions to collect raw videos and keypoint annotations, respectively. The SurgPose dataset consists of approximately 120k surgical instrument instances (80k for training and 40k for validation) of 6 categories. Each instrument instance is labeled with 7 semantic keypoints. Since the videos are collected in stereo pairs, the 2D pose can be lifted to 3D based on stereo-matching depth. In addition to releasing the dataset, we test a few baseline approaches to surgical instrument tracking to demonstrate the utility of SurgPose.

| **[Refinement Module based on Parse Graph of Feature Map for Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11069v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parse graphs of the human body can be obtained in the human brain to help humans complete the human pose estimation (HPE). It contains a hierarchical structure, like a tree structure, and context relations among nodes. Many researchers predefine the parse graph of body structure to design HPE frameworks. However, these frameworks struggle to adapt to instances that deviate from the predefined parse graph and are often parameter-heavy. Unlike them, we view the feature map holistically, much like the human body. It can be optimized using parse graphs, where each node's feature is an implicit expression rather than a fixed one. This allows it to adapt to more instances, unconstrained by rigid structural features. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse Graph of feature map (RMPG), which includes two stages: top-down decomposition and bottom-up combination. In the first stage, the feature map is decomposed into multiple sub-feature maps along the channel. In the second stage, the context relations of sub-feature maps are calculated to obtain their respective context information and the sub-feature maps with context information are concatenated along channels to obtain the refined feature map. Additionally, we design a hierarchical network with fewer parameters using multiple RMPG modules for HPE according to the parse graph of body structure, some of which are supervised to obtain context relations among body parts. Our network achieves excellent results on multiple mainstream human pose datasets. More importantly, the effectiveness of RMPG is proven on different methods. The code of RMPG will be open.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CatVTON: Concatenation Is All You Need for Virtual Try-On with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15886v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on methods based on diffusion models achieve realistic effects but often require additional encoding modules, a large number of training parameters, and complex preprocessing, which increases the burden on training and inference. In this work, we re-evaluate the necessity of additional modules and analyze how to improve training efficiency and reduce redundant steps in the inference process. Based on these insights, we propose CatVTON, a simple and efficient virtual try-on diffusion model that transfers in-shop or worn garments of arbitrary categories to target individuals by concatenating them along spatial dimensions as inputs of the diffusion model. The efficiency of CatVTON is reflected in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network. CatVTON consists only of a VAE and a simplified denoising UNet, removing redundant image and text encoders as well as cross-attentions, and includes just 899.06M parameters. (2) Parameter-efficient training. Through experimental analysis, we identify self-attention modules as crucial for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to the virtual try-on task, enabling high-quality results with only 49.57M training parameters. (3) Simplified inference. CatVTON eliminates unnecessary preprocessing, such as pose estimation, human parsing, and captioning, requiring only a person image and garment reference to guide the virtual try-on process, reducing over 49% memory usage compared to other diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalization performance in in-the-wild scenarios, despite being trained solely on public datasets with 73K samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Semantics-aware Test-time Adaptation for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10724v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work highlights a semantics misalignment in 3D human pose estimation. For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Learning semantical dynamics and spatiotemporal collaboration for human pose estimation in video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10616v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal modeling and spatio-temporal collaboration are pivotal techniques for video-based human pose estimation. Most state-of-the-art methods adopt optical flow or temporal difference, learning local visual content correspondence across frames at the pixel level, to capture motion dynamics. However, such a paradigm essentially relies on localized pixel-to-pixel similarity, which neglects the semantical correlations among frames and is vulnerable to image quality degradations (e.g. occlusions or blur). Moreover, existing approaches often combine motion and spatial (appearance) features via simple concatenation or summation, leading to practical challenges in fully leveraging these distinct modalities. In this paper, we present a novel framework that learns multi-level semantical dynamics and dense spatio-temporal collaboration for multi-frame human pose estimation. Specifically, we first design a Multi-Level Semantic Motion Encoder using a multi-masked context and pose reconstruction strategy. This strategy stimulates the model to explore multi-granularity spatiotemporal semantic relationships among frames by progressively masking the features of (patch) cubes and frames. We further introduce a Spatial-Motion Mutual Learning module which densely propagates and consolidates context information from spatial and motion features to enhance the capability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets new state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, PoseTrack2017, PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HIPPo: Harnessing Image-to-3D Priors for Model-free Zero-shot 6D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10606v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on model-free zero-shot 6D object pose estimation for robotics applications. While existing methods can estimate the precise 6D pose of objects, they heavily rely on curated CAD models or reference images, the preparation of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, 3D models or reference images may not be available in advance and instant robot reaction is desired. In this work, we propose a novel framework named HIPPo, which eliminates the need for curated CAD models and reference images by harnessing image-to-3D priors from Diffusion Models, enabling model-free zero-shot 6D pose estimation. Specifically, we construct HIPPo Dreamer, a rapid image-to-mesh model built on a multiview Diffusion Model and a 3D reconstruction foundation model. Our HIPPo Dreamer can generate a 3D mesh of any unseen objects from a single glance in just a few seconds. Then, as more observations are acquired, we propose to continuously refine the diffusion prior mesh model by joint optimization of object geometry and appearance. This is achieved by a measurement-guided scheme that gradually replaces the plausible diffusion priors with more reliable online observations. Consequently, HIPPo can instantly estimate and track the 6D pose of a novel object and maintain a complete mesh for immediate robotic applications. Thorough experiments on various benchmarks show that HIPPo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 6D object pose estimation when prior reference images are limited.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CMRNext: Camera to LiDAR Matching in the Wild for Localization and Extrinsic Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00129v5)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDARs are widely used for mapping and localization in dynamic environments. However, their high cost limits their widespread adoption. On the other hand, monocular localization in LiDAR maps using inexpensive cameras is a cost-effective alternative for large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, most existing approaches struggle to generalize to new sensor setups and environments, requiring retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we present CMRNext, a novel approach for camera-LIDAR matching that is independent of sensor-specific parameters, generalizable, and can be used in the wild for monocular localization in LiDAR maps and camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration. CMRNext exploits recent advances in deep neural networks for matching cross-modal data and standard geometric techniques for robust pose estimation. We reformulate the point-pixel matching problem as an optical flow estimation problem and solve the Perspective-n-Point problem based on the resulting correspondences to find the relative pose between the camera and the LiDAR point cloud. We extensively evaluate CMRNext on six different robotic platforms, including three publicly available datasets and three in-house robots. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMRNext outperforms existing approaches on both tasks and effectively generalizes to previously unseen environments and sensor setups in a zero-shot manner. We make the code and pre-trained models publicly available at http://cmrnext.cs.uni-freiburg.de .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[HelmetPoser: A Helmet-Mounted IMU Dataset for Data-Driven Estimation of Human Head Motion in Diverse Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05006v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Helmet-mounted wearable positioning systems are crucial for enhancing safety and facilitating coordination in industrial, construction, and emergency rescue environments. These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities. We explore the application of neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to correct IMU biases and improve localization accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these methods across different IMU data window dimensions, motion patterns, and sensor types. We release a publicly available dataset, demonstrate the feasibility of advanced neural network approaches for helmet-based localization, and provide evaluation metrics to establish a baseline for future studies in this field.

For robots, however, this capability remains a substantial challenge, as they cannot interpret abstract instructions and translate them into executable actions. In this paper, we present Manual2Skill, a novel framework that enables robots to perform complex assembly tasks guided by high-level manual instructions. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract structured information from instructional images and then uses this information to construct hierarchical assembly graphs. These graphs represent parts, subassemblies, and the relationships between them. To facilitate task execution, a pose estimation model predicts the relative 6D poses of components at each assembly step. At the same time, a motion planning module generates actionable sequences for real-world robotic implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manual2Skill by successfully assembling several real-world IKEA furniture items. This application highlights its ability to manage long-horizon manipulation tasks with both efficiency and precision, significantly enhancing the practicality of robot learning from instruction manuals. This work marks a step forward in advancing robotic systems capable of understanding and executing complex manipulation tasks in a manner akin to human capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Siren Song: Manipulating Pose Estimation in XR Headsets Using Acoustic Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08865v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extended Reality (XR) experiences involve interactions between users, the real world, and virtual content. A key step to enable these experiences is the XR headset sensing and estimating the user's pose in order to accurately place and render virtual content in the real world. XR headsets use multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, inertial measurement unit) to perform pose estimation and improve its robustness, but this provides an attack surface for adversaries to interfere with the pose estimation process. In this paper, we create and study the effects of acoustic attacks that create false signals in the inertial measurement unit (IMU) on XR headsets, leading to adverse downstream effects on XR applications. We generate resonant acoustic signals on a HoloLens 2 and measure the resulting perturbations in the IMU readings, and also demonstrate both fine-grained and coarse attacks on the popular ORB-SLAM3 and an open-source XR system (ILLIXR). With the knowledge gleaned from attacking these open-source frameworks, we demonstrate four end-to-end proof-of-concept attacks on a HoloLens 2: manipulating user input, clickjacking, zone invasion, and denial of user interaction. Our experiments show that current commercial XR headsets are susceptible to acoustic attacks, raising concerns for their security.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Metamorphic Testing for Pose Estimation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09460v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose estimation systems are used in a variety of fields, from sports analytics to livestock care. Given their potential impact, it is paramount to systematically test their behaviour and potential for failure. This is a complex task due to the oracle problem and the high cost of manual labelling necessary to build ground truth keypoints. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that different applications require systems to focus on different subjects (e.g., human versus animal) or landmarks (e.g., only extremities versus whole body and face), which makes labelled test data rarely reusable. To combat these problems we propose MET-POSE, a metamorphic testing framework for pose estimation systems that bypasses the need for manual annotation while assessing the performance of these systems under different circumstances. MET-POSE thus allows users of pose estimation systems to assess the systems in conditions that more closely relate to their application without having to label an ad-hoc test dataset or rely only on available datasets, which may not be adapted to their application domain. While we define MET-POSE in general terms, we also present a non-exhaustive list of metamorphic rules that represent common challenges in computer vision applications, as well as a specific way to evaluate these rules. We then experimentally show the effectiveness of MET-POSE by applying it to Mediapipe Holistic, a state of the art human pose estimation system, with the FLIC and PHOENIX datasets. With these experiments, we outline numerous ways in which the outputs of MET-POSE can uncover faults in pose estimation systems at a similar or higher rate than classic testing using hand labelled data, and show that users can tailor the rule set they use to the faults and level of accuracy relevant to their application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 2025 IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)</p></details> | None |
| **[BevSplat: Resolving Height Ambiguity via Feature-Based Gaussian Primitives for Weakly-Supervised Cross-View Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09080v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised cross-view localization, where the goal is to estimate the pose of a ground camera relative to a satellite image with noisy ground truth annotations. A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Semi-Supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation by Revisiting Data Augmentation and Consistency Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11566v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2D human pose estimation (HPE) is a basic visual problem. However, its supervised learning requires massive keypoint labels, which is labor-intensive to collect. Thus, we aim at boosting a pose estimator by excavating extra unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning (SSL). Most previous SSHPE methods are consistency-based and strive to maintain consistent outputs for differently augmented inputs. Under this genre, we find that SSHPE can be boosted from two cores: advanced data augmentations and concise consistency training ways. Specifically, for the first core, we discover the synergistic effects of existing augmentations, and reveal novel paradigms for conveniently producing new superior HPE-oriented augmentations which can more effectively add noise on unlabeled samples. We can therefore establish paired easy-hard augmentations with larger difficulty gaps. For the second core, we propose to repeatedly augment unlabeled images with diverse hard augmentations, and generate multi-path predictions sequentially for optimizing multi-losses in a single network. This simple and compact design is interpretable, and easily benefits from newly found augmentations. Comparing to state-of-the-art SSL approaches, our method brings substantial improvements on public datasets. And we extensively validate the superiority and versatility of our approach on conventional human body images, overhead fisheye images, and human hand images.

Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities with an average success rate of 90\% in four real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios.

| **[Semi-Supervised Unconstrained Head Pose Estimation in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02544v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing research on unconstrained in-the-wild head pose estimation suffers from the flaws of its datasets, which consist of either numerous samples by non-realistic synthesis or constrained collection, or small-scale natural images yet with plausible manual annotations. This makes fully-supervised solutions compromised due to the reliance on generous labels. To alleviate it, we propose the first semi-supervised unconstrained head pose estimation method SemiUHPE, which can leverage abundant easily available unlabeled head images. Technically, we choose semi-supervised rotation regression and adapt it to the error-sensitive and label-scarce problem of unconstrained head pose. Our method is based on the observation that the aspect-ratio invariant cropping of wild heads is superior to previous landmark-based affine alignment given that landmarks of unconstrained human heads are usually unavailable, especially for underexplored non-frontal heads. Instead of using a pre-fixed threshold to filter out pseudo labeled heads, we propose dynamic entropy based filtering to adaptively remove unlabeled outliers as training progresses by updating the threshold in multiple stages. We then revisit the design of weak-strong augmentations and improve it by devising two novel head-oriented strong augmentations, termed pose-irrelevant cut-occlusion and pose-altering rotation consistency respectively. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that SemiUHPE outperforms its counterparts greatly on public benchmarks under both the front-range and full-range settings. Furthermore, our proposed method is also beneficial for solving other closely related problems, including generic object rotation regression and 3D head reconstruction, demonstrating good versatility and extensibility.

Existing online gravity estimation methods rely on pose estimation combined with IMU measurements, which is considered best practice when direct velocity measurements are unavailable. However, with radar sensors providing direct velocity data-a measurement not yet utilized for gravity estimation-we found a significant opportunity to improve gravity estimation accuracy substantially. GaRLIO, the proposed gravity-enhanced Radar-LiDAR-Inertial Odometry, can robustly predict gravity to reduce vertical drift while simultaneously enhancing state estimation performance using pointwise velocity measurements. Furthermore, GaRLIO ensures robustness in dynamic environments by utilizing radar to remove dynamic objects from LiDAR point clouds. Our method is validated through experiments in various environments prone to vertical drift, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional LiDAR-Inertial Odometry methods.

Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms.

By observing a user's arm movements, robots can respond appropriately, whether it's providing assistance or avoiding collisions. While visual perception offers potential for human pose estimation, it can be hindered by factors like poor lighting or occlusions. Additionally, wearable inertial sensors, though useful, require frequent calibration as they do not provide absolute position information. Force-myography (FMG) is an alternative approach where muscle perturbations are externally measured. It has been used to observe finger movements, but its application to full arm state estimation is unexplored. In this letter, we investigate the use of a wearable FMG device that can observe the state of the human arm for real-time applications of HRI. We propose a Transformer-based model to map FMG measurements from the shoulder of the user to the physical pose of the arm. The model is also shown to be transferable to other users with limited decline in accuracy. Through real-world experiments with a robotic arm, we demonstrate collision avoidance without relying on visual perception.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, a deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully trained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research vessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches. However, validating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses significant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and the associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a photo-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling image pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and high-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme.

State-of-the-art literature begins with a 3D human pose, from monocular or multiple views, and uses this representation to ground the person within a 3D world space. While standard metrics for accuracy capture joint position errors, they do not consider physical plausibility of the 3D pose. This limitation has motivated researchers to propose other metrics evaluating jitter, floor penetration, and unbalanced postures. Yet, these approaches measure independent instances of errors and are not representative of balance or stability during motion. In this work, we propose measuring physical plausibility from within physics simulation. We introduce two metrics to capture the physical plausibility and stability of predicted 3D poses from any 3D Human Pose Estimation model. Using physics simulation, we discover correlations with existing plausibility metrics and measuring stability during motion. We evaluate and compare the performances of two state-of-the-art methods, a multi-view triangulated baseline, and ground truth 3D markers from the Human3.6m dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to BMVC2024 | None |

With a robust and accurate tracking system on surgical videos, the motion dynamics and movement patterns of the hands can be captured and analyzed for many rich tasks. In this work, we propose a novel hand pose estimation model, CondPose, which improves detection and tracking accuracy by incorporating a pose prior into its prediction. We show improvements over state-of-the-art methods which provide frame-wise independent predictions, by following a temporally guided approach that effectively leverages past predictions. We collect Surgical Hands, the first dataset that provides multi-instance articulated hand pose annotations for videos. Our dataset provides over 8.1k annotated hand poses from publicly available surgical videos and bounding boxes, pose annotations, and tracking IDs to enable multi-instance tracking. When evaluated on Surgical Hands, we show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach using mean Average Precision (mAP), to measure pose estimation accuracy, and Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), to assess pose tracking performance. In comparison to a frame-wise independent strategy, we show greater performance in detecting and tracking hand poses and more substantial impact on localization accuracy.

Recent approaches leverage foundational features to capture semantic and geometry cues from data. However, these approaches fail under partial visibility. We overcome this with a first-complete-then-aggregate strategy for feature extraction utilizing class priors. In this paper, we present GCE-Pose, a method that enhances pose estimation for novel instances by integrating category-level global context prior. GCE-Pose performs semantic shape reconstruction with a proposed Semantic Shape Reconstruction (SSR) module. Given an unseen partial RGB-D object instance, our SSR module reconstructs the instance's global geometry and semantics by deforming category-specific 3D semantic prototypes through a learned deep Linear Shape Model. We further introduce a Global Context Enhanced (GCE) feature fusion module that effectively fuses features from partial RGB-D observations and the reconstructed global context. Extensive experiments validate the impact of our global context prior and the effectiveness of the GCE fusion module, demonstrating that GCE-Pose significantly outperforms existing methods on challenging real-world datasets HouseCat6D and NOCS-REAL275.

Bridging this gap is vital for robotics and computer vision but challenging due to the sparse, unstructured nature of 3D LiDAR data and 2D-focused fiducial marker designs. This dissertation proposes a novel framework for mapping and localization using LFMs is proposed to benefit a variety of real-world applications, including the collection of 3D assets and training data for point cloud registration, 3D map merging, Augmented Reality (AR), and many more.

Category-level methods have received extensive research attention due to their potential for generalization to intra-class unknown objects. However, these methods require manual collection and labeling of large-scale real-world training data. To address this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based paradigm for domain-generalized category-level 9-DoF object pose estimation. Our motivation is to leverage the latent generalization ability of the diffusion model to address the domain generalization challenge in object pose estimation. This entails training the model exclusively on rendered synthetic data to achieve generalization to real-world scenes. We propose an effective diffusion model to redefine 9-DoF object pose estimation from a generative perspective. Our model does not require any 3D shape priors during training or inference. By employing the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model, we demonstrate that the reverse diffusion process can be executed in as few as 3 steps, achieving near real-time performance. Finally, we design a robotic grasping system comprising both hardware and software components. Through comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and the real-world robotic system, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization performance.

This difficulty stems from factors such as shadows, indirect illumination, and inaccurate object-pose estimations due to occluding hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that predicts the hand's impact on environmental visibility and indirect illumination on the object's surface albedo. Our method first learns the geometry and low-fidelity texture of the object, hand, and background through composite rendering of radiance fields. Simultaneously, we optimize the hand and object poses to achieve accurate object-pose estimations. We then refine physics-based rendering parameters - including roughness, specularity, albedo, hand visibility, skin color reflections, and environmental illumination - to produce precise albedo, and accurate hand illumination and shadow regions. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in texture reconstruction and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to account for hand-object interactions in object texture reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at CVM 2025 and will appear in IEEE TVCG.

In this task, deep neural network-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, previous studies show they suffer from spurious correlations raised by "unclean" confounders in models, hindering their performance on novel instances with significant variations. To address this issue, we propose CleanPose, a novel approach integrating causal learning and knowledge distillation to enhance category-level pose estimation. To mitigate the negative effect of unobserved confounders, we develop a causal inference module based on front-door adjustment, which promotes unbiased estimation by reducing potential spurious correlations. Additionally, to further improve generalization ability, we devise a residual-based knowledge distillation method that has proven effective in providing comprehensive category information guidance.

In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025)</p></details> | None |

The workpieces in bin-picking are typically textureless and randomly stacked in a bin, which poses a significant challenge to 6D pose estimation. Existing solutions are typically learning-based methods, which require object-specific training. Their efficiency of practical deployment for novel workpieces is highly limited by data collection and model retraining. Zero-shot 6D pose estimation is a potential approach to address the issue of deployment efficiency. Nevertheless, existing zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods are designed to leverage feature matching to establish point-to-point correspondences for pose estimation, which is less effective for workpieces with textureless appearances and ambiguous local regions. In this paper, we propose ZeroBP, a zero-shot pose estimation framework designed specifically for the bin-picking task. ZeroBP learns Position-Aware Correspondence (PAC) between the scene instance and its CAD model, leveraging both local features and global positions to resolve the mismatch issue caused by ambiguous regions with similar shapes and appearances.

Unlike conventional grasping tasks where the object's geometry is assumed simple, we aim to achieve a "dynamic grasp" of the irregular objects, which requires continuous adjustment during the grasping process. To effectively handle irregular objects, we propose a trajectory optimization framework that comprises two phases. Firstly, in a specified time limit of 10s, initial offline trajectories are computed for a seamless motion from an initial configuration of the robot to grasp the object and deliver it to a pre-defined target location. Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented to update robot trajectories in real-time within 100 ms. This helps to mitigate pose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model inaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking controllers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the optimal trajectories from the proposed framework.

Despite recent progress in data-driven models, feature correspondence learning is still limited by the lack of accurate per-pixel correspondence labels. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new self-supervised scheme, imperative learning (IL), for training feature correspondence.

Specifically, we formulated the problem of correspondence learning as a bilevel optimization, which takes the reprojection error from bundle adjustment as a supervisory signal for the model. To avoid large memory and computation overhead, we leverage the stationary point to effectively back-propagate the implicit gradients through bundle adjustment.

| **[Toward Efficient Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation via a Canonical Domain Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16146v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE). However, performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source and target domains remains a major challenge to generalization, necessitating extensive data augmentation and/or fine-tuning for each specific target domain. To address this issue more efficiently, we propose a novel canonical domain approach that maps both the source and target domains into a unified canonical domain, alleviating the need for additional fine-tuning in the target domain. To construct the canonical domain, we introduce a canonicalization process to generate a novel canonical 2D-3D pose mapping that ensures 2D-3D pose consistency and simplifies 2D-3D pose patterns, enabling more efficient training of lifting networks. The canonicalization of both domains is achieved through the following steps: (1) in the source domain, the lifting network is trained within the canonical domain; (2) in the target domain, input 2D poses are canonicalized prior to inference by leveraging the properties of perspective projection and known camera intrinsics. Consequently, the trained network can be directly applied to the target domain without requiring additional fine-tuning. Experiments conducted with various lifting networks and publicly available datasets (e.g., Human3.6M, Fit3D, MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves generalization capability across datasets while using the same data volume.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[NanoHTNet: Nano Human Topology Network for Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15763v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

| **[Towards Better Robustness: Progressively Joint Pose-3DGS Learning for Arbitrarily Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15096v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation due to its efficiency and high-fidelity rendering. However, 3DGS training requires a known camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this work, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video sequences. Leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we adopt a "divide and conquer" scheme that adaptively splits the video sequence into several segments and optimizes them separately. Extensive experiments on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected real-world dataset show that our Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SpatioTemporal Learning for Human Pose Estimation in Sparsely-Labeled Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15073v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation in videos remains a challenge, largely due to the reliance on extensive manual annotation of large datasets, which is expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, existing approaches often struggle to capture long-range temporal dependencies and overlook the complementary relationship between temporal pose heatmaps and visual features. To address these limitations, we introduce STDPose, a novel framework that enhances human pose estimation by learning spatiotemporal dynamics in sparsely-labeled videos. STDPose incorporates two key innovations: 1) A novel Dynamic-Aware Mask to capture long-range motion context, allowing for a nuanced understanding of pose changes. 2) A system for encoding and aggregating spatiotemporal representations and motion dynamics to effectively model spatiotemporal relationships, improving the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. STDPose establishes a new performance benchmark for both video pose propagation (i.e., propagating pose annotations from labeled frames to unlabeled frames) and pose estimation tasks, across three large-scale evaluation datasets. Additionally, utilizing pseudo-labels generated by pose propagation, STDPose achieves competitive performance with only 26.7% labeled data.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike existing SfM solutions that rely on costly matching and global optimization to achieve accurate 3D reconstructions, Light3R-SfM addresses this limitation through a novel latent global alignment module. This module replaces traditional global optimization with a learnable attention mechanism, effectively capturing multi-view constraints across images for robust and precise camera pose estimation. Light3R-SfM constructs a sparse scene graph via retrieval-score-guided shortest path tree to dramatically reduce memory usage and computational overhead compared to the naive approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light3R-SfM achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing runtime, making it ideal for 3D reconstruction tasks in real-world applications with a runtime constraint.

Previous works predominantly focused on either estimating poses(often at the instance level), or reconstructing shapes, but not both. Glissando-Net is composed of two auto-encoders that are jointly trained, one for RGB images and the other for point clouds. We embrace two key design choices in Glissando-Net to achieve a more accurate prediction of the 3D shape and pose of the object given a single RGB image as input. First, we augment the feature maps of the point cloud encoder and decoder with transformed feature maps from the image decoder, enabling effective 2D-3D interaction in both training and prediction. Second, we predict both the 3D shape and pose of the object in the decoder stage. This way, we better utilize the information in the 3D point clouds presented only in the training stage to train the network for more accurate prediction. We jointly train the two encoder-decoders for RGB and point cloud data to learn how to pass latent features to the point cloud decoder during inference. In testing, the encoder of the 3D point cloud is discarded. The design of Glissando-Net is inspired by codeSLAM. Unlike codeSLAM, which targets 3D reconstruction of scenes, we focus on pose estimation and shape reconstruction of objects, and directly predict the object pose and a pose invariant 3D reconstruction without the need of the code optimization step. Extensive experiments, involving both ablation studies and comparison with competing methods, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, and compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 Figures, accepted to TPAMI -- IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2024)</p></details> | None |

| **[Optimizing Human Pose Estimation Through Focused Human and Joint Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14439v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has given rise to a broad spectrum of novel and compelling applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, as well as surveillance. However, accurate video pose estimation remains an open challenge. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that existing methods learn motion clues from all pixels rather than focusing on the target human body, making them easily misled and disrupted by unimportant information such as background changes or movements of other people. Additionally, while the current Transformer-based pose estimation methods has demonstrated impressive performance with global modeling, they struggle with local context perception and precise positional identification. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose a bilayer Human-Keypoint Mask module that performs coarse-to-fine visual token refinement, which gradually zooms in on the target human body and keypoints while masking out unimportant figure regions. (2) We further introduce a novel deformable cross attention mechanism and a bidirectional separation strategy to adaptively aggregate spatial and temporal motion clues from constrained surrounding contexts. (3) We mathematically formulate the deformable cross attention, constraining that the model focuses solely on the regions centered at the target person body. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmark datasets. A remarkable highlight is that our method achieves an 84.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging wrist joint, which significantly outperforms the 81.5 mAP achieved by the current state-of-the-art method on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Causal-Inspired Multitask Learning for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14356v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based human pose estimation has long been a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer vision. Previous studies focus on spatio-temporal modeling through the enhancement of architecture design and optimization strategies. However, they overlook the causal relationships in the joints, leading to models that may be overly tailored and thus estimate poorly to challenging scenes. Therefore, adequate causal reasoning capability, coupled with good interpretability of model, are both indispensable and prerequisite for achieving reliable results. In this paper, we pioneer a causal perspective on pose estimation and introduce a causal-inspired multitask learning framework, consisting of two stages. \textit{In the first stage}, we try to endow the model with causal spatio-temporal modeling ability by introducing two self-supervision auxiliary tasks. Specifically, these auxiliary tasks enable the network to infer challenging keypoints based on observed keypoint information, thereby imbuing causal reasoning capabilities into the model and making it robust to challenging scenes. \textit{In the second stage}, we argue that not all feature tokens contribute equally to pose estimation. Prioritizing causal (keypoint-relevant) tokens is crucial to achieve reliable results, which could improve the interpretability of the model. To this end, we propose a Token Causal Importance Selection module to identify the causal tokens and non-causal tokens (\textit{e.g.}, background and objects). Additionally, non-causal tokens could provide potentially beneficial cues but may be redundant. We further introduce a non-causal tokens clustering module to merge the similar non-causal tokens. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., ``go to the couch").

Fast3R's Transformer-based architecture forwards N images in a single forward pass, bypassing the need for iterative alignment. Through extensive experiments on camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, Fast3R demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with significant improvements in inference speed and reduced error accumulation.

However, these bottom-facing cameras can sometimes be inconvenient and pose a risk of unintentionally exposing sensitive information, such as private body parts or personal surroundings. To mitigate these issues, we introduce EgoHand. This system provides an alternative solution by integrating millimeter-wave radar and IMUs for hand gesture recognition, thereby offering users an additional option for gesture interaction that enhances privacy protection. To accurately recognize hand gestures, we devise a two-stage skeleton-based gesture recognition scheme. In the first stage, a novel end-to-end Transformer architecture is employed to estimate the coordinates of hand joints. Subsequently, these estimated joint coordinates are utilized for gesture recognition. Extensive experiments involving 10 subjects show that EgoHand can detect hand gestures with 90.8% accuracy. Furthermore, EgoHand demonstrates robust performance across a variety of cross-domain tests, including different users, dominant hands, body postures, and scenes.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements. This proposal not only enhances the performance of Gaussian Splatting SLAM beyond room-scale scenarios but also achieves SLAM performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in large-scale indoor environments.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |

Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \textit{robust}, \textit{efficient}, and \textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes.

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures | None |

In response, posterior-based methods such as conditional Diffusion Models and Invertible Neural Networks have emerged; however, their translation is hampered by a lack of research on adequate validation. In other words, the way progress is measured often does not reflect the needs of the driving practical application. Closing this gap in the literature, we present the first systematic framework for the application-driven validation of posterior-based methods in inverse problems. As a methodological novelty, it adopts key principles from the field of object detection validation, which has a long history of addressing the question of how to locate and match multiple object instances in an image. Treating modes as instances enables us to perform mode-centric validation, using well-interpretable metrics from the application perspective. We demonstrate the value of our framework through instantiations for a synthetic toy example and two medical vision use cases: pose estimation in surgery and imaging-based quantification of functional tissue parameters for diagnostics. Our framework offers key advantages over common approaches to posterior validation in all three examples and could thus revolutionize performance assessment in inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Medical Image Analysis.

To address this we introduce BlanketGen2-Fit3D (BG2-Fit3D), an augmentation of Fit3D dataset that contains 1,217,312 frames with synthetic photo-realistic blankets. To generate it we used BlanketGen2, our new and improved version of our BlanketGen pipeline that simulates synthetic blankets using ground-truth Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) meshes and then renders them as transparent images that can be layered on top of the original frames. This dataset was used in combination with the original Fit3D to finetune the ViTPose-B HPE model, to evaluate synthetic blanket augmentation effectiveness. The trained models were further evaluated on a real-world blanket occluded in-bed HPE dataset (SLP dataset). Comparing architectures trained on only Fit3D with the ones trained with our synthetic blanket augmentation the later improved pose estimation performance on BG2-Fit3D, the synthetic blanket occluded dataset significantly to (0.977 Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), 0.149 Normalized Mean Error (NME)) with an absolute 4.4% PCK increase. Furthermore, the test results on SLP demonstrated the utility of synthetic data augmentation by improving performance by an absolute 2.3% PCK, on real-world images with the poses occluded by real blankets. These results show synthetic blanket augmentation has the potential to improve in-bed blanket occluded HPE from RGB images.

This paper revisits this problem and reveals two critical yet overlooked issues: 1) cross-domain gap, i.e., due to significant variations between source-target domain pose distributions; and 2) structural fidelity gap, i.e., predicted skeletal poses manifest distorted topology, usually with misplaced joints and disproportionate bone lengths. This paper fills these gaps by reformulating the task into a novel two-phase framework dubbed DT-Pose: Domain-consistent representation learning and Topology-constrained Pose decoding. Concretely, we first propose a temporal-consistent contrastive learning strategy with uniformity regularization, coupled with self-supervised masking-reconstruction operations, to enable robust learning of domain-consistent and motion-discriminative WiFi-specific representations. Beyond this, we introduce a simple yet effective pose decoder with task prompts, which integrates Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Transformer layers to constrain the topology structure of the generated skeleton by exploring the adjacent-overarching relationships among human joints. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method in tackling these fundamental challenges in both 2D/3D human pose estimation tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | None |

While previous datasets have primarily focused on local poses, often limited to a single person or in constrained, indoor settings, the infrastructure deployed for this sporting event allows access to multiple fixed and moving cameras in different stadiums. We exploit the static multi-view setup of HD cameras to recover the 3D player poses and motions with unprecedented accuracy given capture areas of more than 1.75 acres.

However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks.

Although many general-purpose tools exist for landmark localization in classical computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation, they lack the specialized features and modularity necessary for anatomical landmark localization applications in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce landmarker, a Python package built on PyTorch.

| **[A New Teacher-Reviewer-Student Framework for Semi-supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09565v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional 2D human pose estimation methods typically require extensive labeled annotations, which are both labor-intensive and expensive. In contrast, semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation can alleviate the above problems by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data along with a small portion of labeled data. Existing semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation methods update the network through backpropagation, ignoring crucial historical information from the previous training process. Therefore, we propose a novel semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation method by utilizing a newly designed Teacher-Reviewer-Student framework. Specifically, we first mimic the phenomenon that human beings constantly review previous knowledge for consolidation to design our framework, in which the teacher predicts results to guide the student's learning and the reviewer stores important historical parameters to provide additional supervision signals. Secondly, we introduce a Multi-level Feature Learning strategy, which utilizes the outputs from different stages of the backbone to estimate the heatmap to guide network training, enriching the supervisory information while effectively capturing keypoint relationships. Finally, we design a data augmentation strategy, i.e., Keypoint-Mix, to perturb pose information by mixing different keypoints, thus enhancing the network's ability to discern keypoints. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, demonstrate our method achieves significant improvements compared to the existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the complexity of deployment environments or the prevalence of ambiguous-condition objects, the practical application of robotics still faces many challenges, leading to frequent errors. Traditional methods and some LLM-based approaches, although improved, still require substantial human intervention and struggle with autonomous error correction in complex scenarios.In this work, we propose RoboReflect, a novel framework leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enable self-reflection and autonomous error correction in robotic grasping tasks. RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved.The corrected strategies are saved in a memory for future task reference.We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories.Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques using GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's ability to adapt and correct errors independently. These findings underscore the critical importance of autonomous selfreflection in robotic systems while effectively addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

However, RGB images are susceptible to limitations such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and potential user discomfort. Consequently, multi-modal sensing, which leverages non-intrusive sensors, is gaining increasing attention. Nevertheless, multi-modal 3D HPE still faces challenges, including modality imbalance and the imperative for continual learning. In this work, we introduce a novel balanced continual multi-modal learning method for 3D HPE, which harnesses the power of RGB, LiDAR, mmWave, and WiFi. Specifically, we propose a Shapley value-based contribution algorithm to quantify the contribution of each modality and identify modality imbalance. To address this imbalance, we employ a re-learning strategy. Furthermore, recognizing that raw data is prone to noise contamination, we develop a novel denoising continual learning approach. This approach incorporates a noise identification and separation module to mitigate the adverse effects of noise and collaborates with the balanced learning strategy to enhance optimization. Additionally, an adaptive EWC mechanism is employed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-adopted multi-modal dataset, MM-Fi, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach in boosting 3D pose estimation and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in complex scenarios. We will release our codes.</p></details> |  | None |

While single-frame pose estimation has seen significant progress, it often fails to capture the temporal dynamics for understanding complex, continuous movements. We propose Poseidon, a novel multi-frame pose estimation architecture that extends the ViTPose model by integrating temporal information for enhanced accuracy and robustness to address these limitations. Poseidon introduces key innovations: (1) an Adaptive Frame Weighting (AFW) mechanism that dynamically prioritises frames based on their relevance, ensuring that the model focuses on the most informative data; (2) a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) module that aggregates features from different backbone layers to capture both fine-grained details and high-level semantics; and (3) a Cross-Attention module for effective information exchange between central and contextual frames, enhancing the model's temporal coherence. The proposed architecture improves performance in complex video scenarios and offers scalability and computational efficiency suitable for real-world applications. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PoseTrack21 and PoseTrack18 datasets, achieving mAP scores of 88.3 and 87.8, respectively, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods do not operate well for testing images whose distribution is far from that of training data. This problem might be alleviated by involving diverse data during training, however it is non-trivial to collect such diverse data with corresponding labels (i.e. 3D pose). In this paper, we introduced an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 3D pose estimation that utilizes the unlabeled data in addition to labeled data via masked image modeling (MIM) framework. Foreground-centric reconstruction and attention regularization are further proposed to increase the effectiveness of unlabeled data usage. Experiments are conducted on the various datasets in human and hand pose estimation tasks, especially using the cross-domain scenario.

Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

Among these, sparse feature matching stands out as an efficient, versatile, and generally lightweight approach with numerous applications. However, feature-based methods often struggle with significant viewpoint and appearance changes, leading to matching failures and inaccurate pose estimates. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that leverages a globally sparse yet locally dense 3D representation of 2D features. By tracking and triangulating landmarks over a sequence of frames, we construct a sparse voxel map optimized to render image patch descriptors observed during tracking. Given an initial pose estimate, we first synthesize descriptors from the voxels using volumetric rendering and then perform feature matching to estimate the camera pose. This methodology enables the generation of descriptors for unseen views, enhancing robustness to view changes. We extensively evaluate our method on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art feature representation techniques in indoor environments, achieving up to a 39% improvement in median translation error. Additionally, our approach yields comparable results to other methods for outdoor scenarios while maintaining lower memory and computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), Tucson, Arizona, US, Feb 28-Mar 4, 2025</p></details> | None |

Metric depth estimation, which involves predicting absolute distances, poses particular challenges, as even the most advanced foundation models remain prone to critical errors. Since quantifying the uncertainty has emerged as a promising endeavor to address these limitations and enable trustworthy deployment, we fuse five different uncertainty quantification methods with the current state-of-the-art DepthAnythingV2 foundation model. To cover a wide range of metric depth domains, we evaluate their performance on four diverse datasets. Our findings identify fine-tuning with the Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood Loss (GNLL) as a particularly promising approach, offering reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining predictive performance and computational efficiency on par with the baseline, encompassing both training and inference time. By fusing uncertainty quantification and foundation models within the context of monocular depth estimation, this paper lays a critical foundation for future research aimed at improving not only model performance but also its explainability. Extending this critical synthesis of uncertainty quantification and foundation models into other crucial tasks, such as semantic segmentation and pose estimation, presents exciting opportunities for safer and more reliable machine vision systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods fail to provide high-quality representations due to reliance on pixel-level enhancements that compromise semantics and the inability to effectively handle extreme low-light conditions for robust feature learning. In this work, we propose a frequency-based framework for low-light human pose estimation, rooted in the "divide-and-conquer" principle. Instead of uniformly enhancing the entire image, our method focuses on task-relevant information. By applying dynamic illumination correction to the low-frequency components and low-rank denoising to the high-frequency components, we effectively enhance both the semantic and texture information essential for accurate pose estimation. As a result, this targeted enhancement method results in robust, high-quality representations, significantly improving pose estimation performance.

However, these models oversimplify anatomical structures, limiting their accuracy in capturing true joint locations and movements, which reduces their applicability in biomechanics, healthcare, and robotics. Biomechanically accurate pose estimation, on the other hand, typically requires costly marker-based motion capture systems and optimization techniques in specialized labs. To bridge this gap, we propose BioPose, a novel learning-based framework for predicting biomechanically accurate 3D human pose directly from monocular videos. BioPose includes three key components: a Multi-Query Human Mesh Recovery model (MQ-HMR), a Neural Inverse Kinematics (NeurIK) model, and a 2D-informed pose refinement technique. MQ-HMR leverages a multi-query deformable transformer to extract multi-scale fine-grained image features, enabling precise human mesh recovery. NeurIK treats the mesh vertices as virtual markers, applying a spatial-temporal network to regress biomechanically accurate 3D poses under anatomical constraints. To further improve 3D pose estimations, a 2D-informed refinement step optimizes the query tokens during inference by aligning the 3D structure with 2D pose observations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that BioPose significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

In turn, this enables various applications to use such depth predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for estimating the relative pose between two cameras from point correspondences with associated monocular depths. Since depth predictions are typically defined up to an unknown scale and shift parameter, our solvers jointly estimate both scale and shift parameters together with the camera pose. We derive efficient solvers for three cases: (1) two calibrated cameras, (2) two uncalibrated cameras with an unknown but shared focal length, and (3) two uncalibrated cameras with unknown and different focal lengths. Experiments on synthetic and real data, including experiments with depth maps estimated by 11 different depth predictors, show the practical viability of our solvers.

They often use SLAM approaches to build such maps. Loop closures via place recognition help maintain accurate pose estimates by mitigating global drift. This paper presents a robust loop closure detection pipeline for outdoor SLAM with LiDAR-equipped robots. The method handles various LiDAR sensors with different scanning patterns, field of views and resolutions. It generates local maps from LiDAR scans and aligns them using a ground alignment module to handle both planar and non-planar motion of the LiDAR, ensuring applicability across platforms. The method uses density-preserving bird's eye view projections of these local maps and extracts ORB feature descriptors from them for place recognition. It stores the feature descriptors in a binary search tree for efficient retrieval, and self-similarity pruning addresses perceptual aliasing in repetitive environments. Extensive experiments on public and self-recorded datasets demonstrate accurate loop closure detection, long-term localization, and cross-platform multi-map alignment, agnostic to the LiDAR scanning patterns, fields of view, and motion profiles.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods still struggle to recognise seen actions on unseen objects due to the limitations in representing object shape and movement using 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, the reliance on object templates at test time limits their generalisability to unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage superquadrics as an alternative 3D object representation to bounding boxes and demonstrate their effectiveness on both template-free object reconstruction and action recognition tasks. Moreover, as we find that pure appearance-based methods can outperform the unified methods, the potential benefits from 3D geometric information remain unclear. Therefore, we study the compositionality of actions by considering a more challenging task where the training combinations of verbs and nouns do not overlap with the testing split. We extend H2O and FPHA datasets with compositional splits and design a novel collaborative learning framework that can explicitly reason about the geometric relations between hands and the manipulated object.

However, how to accurately solve three-view relative motion only with 2D observations of points and lines in real time has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a novel three-view pose solver based on rotation-translation decoupled estimation. First, a high-precision rotation estimation method based on normal vector coplanarity constraints that consider the uncertainty of observations is proposed, which can be solved by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm efficiently. Second, a robust linear translation constraint that minimizes the degree of the rotation components and feature observation components in equations is elaborately designed for estimating translations accurately.

Splat-Nav consists of two components: 1) Splat-Plan, a safe planning module, and 2) Splat-Loc, a robust vision-based pose estimation module. Splat-Plan builds a safe-by-construction polytope corridor through the map based on mathematically rigorous collision constraints and then constructs a B\'ezier curve trajectory through this corridor. Splat-Loc provides real-time recursive state estimates given only an RGB feed from an on-board camera, leveraging the point-cloud representation inherent in GSplat scenes. Working together, these modules give robots the ability to recursively re-plan smooth and safe trajectories to goal locations. Goals can be specified with position coordinates, or with language commands by using a semantic GSplat. We demonstrate improved safety compared to point cloud-based methods in extensive simulation experiments. In a total of 126 hardware flights, we demonstrate equivalent safety and speed compared to motion capture and visual odometry, but without a manual frame alignment required by those methods. We show online re-planning at more than 2 Hz and pose estimation at about 25 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby enabling real-time navigation.

They use an extra reference network or an additional image encoder to process multiple conditional image inputs, which adds complexity pre-processing and additional computational costs. Besides, they require more than 25 inference steps, bringing longer inference time. In this work, with the development of diffusion transformer (DiT), we rethink the necessity of additional reference network or image encoder and introduce MC-VTON, which leverages DiT's intrinsic backbone to seamlessly integrate minimal conditional try-on inputs. Compared to existing methods, the superiority of MC-VTON is demonstrated in four aspects: (1) Superior detail fidelity. Our DiT-based MC-VTON exhibits superior fidelity in preserving fine-grained details. (2) Simplified network and inputs. We remove any extra reference network or image encoder. We also remove unnecessary conditions like the long prompt, pose estimation, human parsing, and depth map. We require only the masked person image and the garment image. (3) Parameter-efficient training. To process the try-on task, we fine-tune the FLUX.1-dev with only 39.7M additional parameters (0.33% of the backbone parameters). (4) Less inference steps. We apply distillation diffusion on MC-VTON and only need 8 steps to generate a realistic try-on image, with only 86.8M additional parameters (0.72% of the backbone parameters). Experiments show that MC-VTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results with fewer condition inputs, trainable parameters, and inference steps than baseline methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Similar to the standard camera, the event camera requires precise intrinsic calibration to facilitate further high-level visual applications, such as pose estimation and mapping. While several calibration methods for event cameras have been proposed, most of them are either (i) engineering-driven, heavily relying on conventional image-based calibration pipelines, or (ii) inconvenient, requiring complex instrumentation. To this end, we propose an accurate and convenient intrinsic calibration method for event cameras, named eKalibr, which builds upon a carefully designed event-based circle grid pattern recognition algorithm. To extract target patterns from events, we perform event-based normal flow estimation to identify potential events generated by circle edges, and cluster them spatially. Subsequently, event clusters associated with the same grid circles are matched and grouped using normal flows, for subsequent time-varying ellipse estimation. Fitted ellipse centers are time-synchronized, for final grid pattern recognition. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of eKalibr in terms of pattern extraction and intrinsic calibration.

Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant relative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale training and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric (absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for geometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains relatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view image alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth priors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based solutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation that explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities, covering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a hybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic point-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine correction modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but also, surprisingly, the ``metric" ones. Results across multiple datasets demonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based baselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated setups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different feature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent advances on both modules.

However, bridging the sim-to-real gap for each new task requires substantial human effort, such as careful reward engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and system identification. In this work, we present a system that leverages low-level skills to address these challenges for more complex tasks. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical policy for in-hand object reorientation based on previously acquired rotation skills. This hierarchical policy learns to select which low-level skill to execute based on feedback from both the environment and the low-level skill policies themselves. Compared to learning from scratch, the hierarchical policy is more robust to out-of-distribution changes and transfers easily from simulation to real-world environments. Additionally, we propose a generalizable object pose estimator that uses proprioceptive information, low-level skill predictions, and control errors as inputs to estimate the object pose over time. We demonstrate that our system can reorient objects, including symmetrical and textureless ones, to a desired pose.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: https://dexhier.github.io</p></details> | None |
| **[LP-ICP: General Localizability-Aware Point Cloud Registration for Robust Localization in Extreme Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02580v2)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is a crucial component of LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms. However, its performance can be negatively affected in unstructured environments that lack features and geometric structures, leading to low accuracy and poor robustness in localization and mapping. It is known that degeneracy caused by the lack of geometric constraints can lead to errors in 6-DOF pose estimation along ill-conditioned directions. Therefore, there is a need for a broader and more fine-grained degeneracy detection and handling method. This paper proposes a new point cloud registration framework, LP-ICP, that combines point-to-line and point-to-plane distance metrics in the ICP algorithm, with localizability detection and handling. LP-ICP consists of a localizability detection module and an optimization module. The localizability detection module performs localizability analysis by utilizing the correspondences between edge points (with low local smoothness) to lines and planar points (with high local smoothness) to planes between the scan and the map. The localizability contribution of individual correspondence constraints can be applied to a broader range. The optimization module adds additional soft and hard constraints to the optimization equations based on the localizability category. This allows the pose to be constrained along ill-conditioned directions, with updates either tending towards the constraint value or leaving the initial estimate unchanged. This improves accuracy and reduces fluctuations. The proposed method is extensively evaluated through experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets, demonstrating higher or comparable accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset and code of this paper will also be open-sourced at https://github.com/xuqingyuan2000/LP-ICP.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 8 Figures Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/xuqingyuan2000/LP-ICP) |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

However, traditional LIO systems tend to focus more on localization rather than mapping, with maps consisting mostly of sparse geometric elements, which is not ideal for downstream tasks. Recent emerging neural field technology has great potential in dense mapping, but pure LiDAR mapping is difficult to work on high-dynamic vehicles. To mitigate this challenge, we present a new solution that tightly couples geometric kinematics with neural fields to enhance simultaneous state estimation and dense mapping capabilities. We propose both semi-coupled and tightly coupled Kinematic-Neural LIO (KN-LIO) systems that leverage online SDF decoding and iterated error-state Kalman filtering to fuse laser and inertial data. Our KN-LIO minimizes information loss and improves accuracy in state estimation, while also accommodating asynchronous multi-LiDAR inputs. Evaluations on diverse high-dynamic datasets demonstrate that our KN-LIO achieves performance on par with or superior to existing state-of-the-art solutions in pose estimation and offers improved dense mapping accuracy over pure LiDAR-based methods.

While there are some mobile AR products implemented with specific hardware at a high cost, the software approaches of AR implementation on mobile platforms(such as smartphones, tablet PC, etc.) are still far from practical use. GPS-based mobile AR systems usually perform poorly due to the inaccurate positioning in the indoor environment. Previous vision-based pose estimation methods need to continuously track predefined markers within a short distance, which greatly degrade user experience. This paper first conducts a comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art AR and localization systems on mobile platforms. Then, we propose an effective indoor mobile AR framework. In the framework, a fusional localization method and a new pose estimation implementation are developed to increase the overall matching rate and thus improving AR display accuracy. Experiments show that our framework has higher performance than approaches purely based on images or Wi-Fi signals. We achieve low average error distances (0.61-0.81m) and accurate matching rates (77%-82%) when the average sampling grid length is set to 0.5m.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figues | None |

However, using these datasets to evaluate dense geometry tasks, such as depth rendering, can be problematic as the meshes of the dataset are often incomplete and may produce wrong ground truth to evaluate the details. In this paper, we propose SCRREAM, a dataset annotation framework that allows annotation of fully dense meshes of objects in the scene and registers camera poses on the real image sequence, which can produce accurate ground truth for both sparse 3D as well as dense 3D tasks. We show the details of the dataset annotation pipeline and showcase four possible variants of datasets that can be obtained from our framework with example scenes, such as indoor reconstruction and SLAM, scene editing & object removal, human reconstruction and 6d pose estimation. Recent pipelines for indoor reconstruction and SLAM serve as new benchmarks. In contrast to previous indoor dataset, our design allows to evaluate dense geometry tasks on eleven sample scenes against accurately rendered ground truth depth maps.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, we introduce VinT-6D, the first extensive multi-modal dataset integrating vision, touch, and proprioception, to enhance robotic manipulation. VinT-6D comprises 2 million VinT-Sim and 0.1 million VinT-Real splits, collected via simulations in MuJoCo and Blender and a custom-designed real-world platform. This dataset is tailored for robotic hands, offering models with whole-hand tactile perception and high-quality, well-aligned data. To the best of our knowledge, the VinT-Real is the largest considering the collection difficulties in the real-world environment so that it can bridge the gap of simulation to real compared to the previous works.

Vision-based methods for surgical instrument pose estimation provide a practical approach to tool tracking, but they often require markers to be attached to the instruments. Recently, more research has focused on the development of marker-less methods based on deep learning. However, acquiring realistic surgical data, with ground truth instrument poses, required for deep learning training, is challenging. To address the issues in surgical instrument pose estimation, we introduce the Surgical Robot Instrument Pose Estimation (SurgRIPE) challenge, hosted at the 26th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2023. The objectives of this challenge are: (1) to provide the surgical vision community with realistic surgical video data paired with ground truth instrument poses, and (2) to establish a benchmark for evaluating markerless pose estimation methods. The challenge led to the development of several novel algorithms that showcased improved accuracy and robustness over existing methods. The performance evaluation study on the SurgRIPE dataset highlights the potential of these advanced algorithms to be integrated into robotic surgery systems, paving the way for more precise and autonomous surgical procedures. The SurgRIPE challenge has successfully established a new benchmark for the field, encouraging further research and development in surgical robot instrument pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 18 figures, journal paper</p></details> | None |

Such limitation prohibits their direct use in egocentric video settings, where hands and camera are continuously in motion. In this work, we propose HaWoR, a high-fidelity method for hand motion reconstruction in world coordinates from egocentric videos. We propose to decouple the task by reconstructing the hand motion in the camera space and estimating the camera trajectory in the world coordinate system. To achieve precise camera trajectory estimation, we propose an adaptive egocentric SLAM framework that addresses the shortcomings of traditional SLAM methods, providing robust performance under challenging camera dynamics. To ensure robust hand motion trajectories, even when the hands move out of view frustum, we devise a novel motion infiller network that effectively completes the missing frames of the sequence. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that HaWoR achieves state-of-the-art performance on both hand motion reconstruction and world-frame camera trajectory estimation under different egocentric benchmark datasets.

In this paper, we address the first event-based dataset SEENIC with real event frames captured by an event-based camera on a testbed. We show the methods and results of the first event-based solution for this use case, where our small spiking end-to-end network (S2E2) solution achieves interesting results over 21cm position error and 14degree rotation error, which is the first step towards fully event-based processing for embedded spacecraft pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

We propose a zero-shot method to achieve category-level 6-DOF object pose estimation, which exploits both 2D and 3D universal features of input RGB-D image to establish semantic similarity-based correspondences and can be extended to unseen categories without additional model fine-tuning. Our method begins with combining efficient 2D universal features to find sparse correspondences between intra-category objects and gets initial coarse pose. To handle the correspondence degradation of 2D universal features if the pose deviates much from the target pose, we use an iterative strategy to optimize the pose. Subsequently, to resolve pose ambiguities due to shape differences between intra-category objects, the coarse pose is refined by optimizing with dense alignment constraint of 3D universal features. Our method outperforms previous methods on the REAL275 and Wild6D benchmarks for unseen categories.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 | None |
| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Occlusion Resilient Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02773v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occlusions are a significant challenge to human pose estimation algorithms, often resulting in inaccurate and anatomically implausible poses. Although current occlusion-robust human pose estimation algorithms exhibit impressive performance on existing datasets, their success is largely attributed to supervised training and the availability of additional information, such as multiple views or temporal continuity. Furthermore, these algorithms typically suffer from performance degradation under distribution shifts. While existing domain adaptive human pose estimation algorithms address this bottleneck, they tend to perform suboptimally when the target domain images are occluded, a common occurrence in real-life scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OR-POSE: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Occlusion Resilient Human POSE Estimation. OR-POSE is an innovative unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm which effectively mitigates domain shifts and overcomes occlusion challenges by employing the mean teacher framework for iterative pseudo-label refinement. Additionally, OR-POSE reinforces realistic pose prediction by leveraging a learned human pose prior which incorporates the anatomical constraints of humans in the adaptation process. Lastly, OR-POSE avoids overfitting to inaccurate pseudo labels generated from heavily occluded images by employing a novel visibility-based curriculum learning approach. This enables the model to gradually transition from training samples with relatively less occlusion to more challenging, heavily occluded samples. Extensive experiments show that OR-POSE outperforms existing analogous state-of-the-art algorithms by $\sim$ 7% on challenging occluded human pose estimation datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, off-the-shelf LiDAR-based SLAM methods suffer from significant pose estimation drifts, particularly components relevant to the vertical direction, when passing to uneven terrains. This deficiency typically leads to a conspicuously distorted global map. In this article, a LiDAR-based SLAM method is presented to improve the accuracy of pose estimations for ground vehicles in rough terrains, which is termed Rotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only (ROLO) SLAM. The method exploits a forward location prediction to coarsely eliminate the location difference of consecutive scans, thereby enabling separate and accurate determination of the location and orientation at the front-end. Furthermore, we adopt a parallel-capable spatial voxelization for correspondence-matching. We develop a spherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate the rotation of vehicle. By incorporating geometric alignment, we introduce the motion constraint into the optimization formulation to enhance the rapid and effective estimation of LiDAR's translation. Subsequently, we extract several keyframes to construct the submap and exploit an alignment from the current scan to the submap for precise pose estimation. Meanwhile, a global-scale factor graph is established to aid in the reduction of cumulative errors. In various scenes, diverse experiments have been conducted to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM excels in pose estimation of ground vehicles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by Journal of Field Robotics</p></details> | None |
| **[Generic Objects as Pose Probes for Few-shot View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16690v3)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiance fields including NeRFs and 3D Gaussians demonstrate great potential in high-fidelity rendering and scene reconstruction, while they require a substantial number of posed images as inputs. COLMAP is frequently employed for preprocessing to estimate poses, while it necessitates a large number of feature matches to operate effectively, and it struggles with scenes characterized by sparse features, large baselines between images, or a limited number of input images. We aim to tackle few-view NeRF reconstruction using only 3 to 6 unposed scene images. Traditional methods often use calibration boards but they are not common in images. We propose a novel idea of utilizing everyday objects, commonly found in both images and real life, as "pose probes". The probe object is automatically segmented by SAM, whose shape is initialized from a cube. We apply a dual-branch volume rendering optimization (object NeRF and scene NeRF) to constrain the pose optimization and jointly refine the geometry. Specifically, object poses of two views are first estimated by PnP matching in an SDF representation, which serves as initial poses. PnP matching, requiring only a few features, is suitable for feature-sparse scenes. Additional views are incrementally incorporated to refine poses from preceding views. In experiments, PoseProbe achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis across multiple datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly in few-view and large-baseline scenes where COLMAP struggles. In ablations, using different objects in a scene yields comparable performance.

However, previous methods ignore the intricate dependence within the 2D pose sequence and learn single temporal correlation. To alleviate this limitation, we propose TCPFormer, which leverages an implicit pose proxy as an intermediate representation. Each proxy within the implicit pose proxy can build one temporal correlation therefore helping us learn more comprehensive temporal correlation of human motion. Specifically, our method consists of three key components: Proxy Update Module (PUM), Proxy Invocation Module (PIM), and Proxy Attention Module (PAM). PUM first uses pose features to update the implicit pose proxy, enabling it to store representative information from the pose sequence. PIM then invocates and integrates the pose proxy with the pose sequence to enhance the motion semantics of each pose. Finally, PAM leverages the above mapping between the pose sequence and pose proxy to enhance the temporal correlation of the whole pose sequence. Experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that our proposed TCPFormer outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by the 39th Annual AAAl Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAl 2025)</p></details> | None |

Surgery is one of the main treatment options for cancer. However, surgeons rely on the sense of touch and naked eye with limited use of pre-operative image data to directly guide the excision of cancerous tissues and metastases due to the lack of reliable intraoperative visualisation tools. This leads to increased costs and harm to the patient where the cancer is removed with positive margins, or where other critical structures are unintentionally impacted. There is therefore a pressing need for more reliable and accurate intraoperative visualisation tools for minimally invasive surgery to improve surgical outcomes and enhance patient care. A recent miniaturised cancer detection probe (i.e., SENSEI developed by Lightpoint Medical Ltd.) leverages the cancer-targeting ability of nuclear agents to more accurately identify cancer intra-operatively using the emitted gamma signal. However, the use of this probe presents a visualisation challenge as the probe is non-imaging and is air-gapped from the tissue, making it challenging for the surgeon to locate the probe-sensing area on the tissue surface. Geometrically, the sensing area is defined as the intersection point between the gamma probe axis and the tissue surface in 3D space but projected onto the 2D laparoscopic image. Hence, in this thesis, tool tracking, pose estimation, and segmentation tools were developed first, followed by laparoscope image depth estimation algorithms and 3D reconstruction methods.</p></details> | Doctoral thesis | None |

Using structure-from-motion (SfM) as a benchmark for 3D tasks, we investigate if intermediate features from OpenSora, a video generation model, can support camera pose estimation. We first examine native 3D awareness in video generation features by routing raw intermediate outputs to SfM-prediction modules like DUSt3R. Then, we explore the impact of fine-tuning on camera pose estimation to enhance 3D awareness. Results indicate that while video generator features have limited inherent 3D awareness, task-specific supervision significantly boosts their accuracy for camera pose estimation, resulting in competitive performance. The proposed unified model, named JOG3R, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality without degrading video generation quality.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose a hybrid approach that utilizes rigged avatars and the pipeline to generate synthetic datasets to acquire the necessary 3D annotations for training. Our method introduces a simple attention-based MLP network for converting 2D poses to 3D, designed to be independent of the input image to ensure scalability for poses in natural environments. Additionally, we identify that existing anatomical keypoint detectors are insufficient for accurate pose retargeting onto arbitrary avatars. To overcome this, we present a lookup table based on a deep pose estimation method using a synthetic collection of diverse actions rigged avatars perform. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this lookup table-based retargeting approach. Overall, we propose a comprehensive framework with systematically synthesized datasets for lifting poses from 2D to 3D and then utilize this to re-target motion from wild settings onto arbitrary avatars.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, unreliable localization results of invisible keypoints degrade the quality of correspondences. In this paper, we address this issue by localizing the important keypoints in terms of visibility. Since keypoint visibility information is currently missing in the dataset collection process, we propose an efficient way to generate binary visibility labels from available object-level annotations, for keypoints of both asymmetric objects and symmetric objects. We further derive real-valued visibility-aware importance from binary labels based on the PageRank algorithm. Taking advantage of the flexibility of our visibility-aware importance, we construct VAPO (Visibility-Aware POse estimator) by integrating the visibility-aware importance with a state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm, along with additional positional encoding. VAPO can work in both CAD-based and CAD-free settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular pose estimation benchmarks including Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-V. The results show that, VAPO significantly improves both the keypoint correspondences and final estimated poses, and clearly achieves state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Journal for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Unlike traditional MLLMs limited to text output, VisionLLM v2 significantly broadens its application scope. It excels not only in conventional visual question answering (VQA) but also in open-ended, cross-domain vision tasks such as object localization, pose estimation, and image generation and editing. To this end, we propose a new information transmission mechanism termed "super link", as a medium to connect MLLM with task-specific decoders. It not only allows flexible transmission of task information and gradient feedback between the MLLM and multiple downstream decoders but also effectively resolves training conflicts in multi-tasking scenarios. In addition, to support the diverse range of tasks, we carefully collected and combed training data from hundreds of public vision and vision-language tasks. In this way, our model can be joint-trained end-to-end on hundreds of vision language tasks and generalize to these tasks using a set of shared parameters through different user prompts, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. We believe VisionLLM v2 will offer a new perspective on the generalization of MLLMs.</p></details> | 44 pages | None |
| **[Hierarchical Pose Estimation and Mapping with Multi-Scale Neural Feature Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20976v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic applications require a comprehensive understanding of the scene. In recent years, neural fields-based approaches that parameterize the entire environment have become popular. These approaches are promising due to their continuous nature and their ability to learn scene priors. However, the use of neural fields in robotics becomes challenging when dealing with unknown sensor poses and sequential measurements. This paper focuses on the problem of sensor pose estimation for large-scale neural implicit SLAM. We investigate implicit mapping from a probabilistic perspective and propose hierarchical pose estimation with a corresponding neural network architecture. Our method is well-suited for large-scale implicit map representations. The proposed approach operates on consecutive outdoor LiDAR scans and achieves accurate pose estimation, while maintaining stable mapping quality for both short and long trajectories. We built our method on a structured and sparse implicit representation suitable for large-scale reconstruction and evaluated it using the KITTI and MaiCity datasets. Our approach outperforms the baseline in terms of mapping with unknown poses and achieves state-of-the-art localization accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they present a major challenge due to their distinct refractive and reflective properties when it comes to accurately estimating the 6D pose. To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for transparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the refractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our method leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and independent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we model the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a unique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction that is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By integrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we show that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects, using only RGB images as input. Our method further introduces a novel transparent object compositing loss, fostering the generation of superior refractive-intermediate features. Empirical evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D datasets. Robot grasping experiments further demonstrate that ReFlow6D's pose estimation accuracy effectively translates to real-world robotics task.

| **[Frequency-aware Event Cloud Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20803v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are biologically inspired sensors that emit events asynchronously with remarkable temporal resolution, garnering significant attention from both industry and academia. Mainstream methods favor frame and voxel representations, which reach a satisfactory performance while introducing time-consuming transformation, bulky models, and sacrificing fine-grained temporal information. Alternatively, Point Cloud representation demonstrates promise in addressing the mentioned weaknesses, but it ignores the polarity information, and its models have limited proficiency in abstracting long-term events' features. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware network named FECNet that leverages Event Cloud representations. FECNet fully utilizes 2S-1T-1P Event Cloud by innovating the event-based Group and Sampling module. To accommodate the long sequence events from Event Cloud, FECNet embraces feature extraction in the frequency domain via the Fourier transform. This approach substantially extinguishes the explosion of Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) while effectively abstracting spatial-temporal features. We conducted extensive experiments on event-based object classification, action recognition, and human pose estimation tasks, and the results substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of FECNet.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained prominence due to its explicit representation with efficient training speed and real-time rendering capabilities. However, existing methods still heavily depend on accurate camera poses for reconstruction. Although some recent approaches attempt to train 3DGS models without the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) preprocessing from monocular video datasets, these methods suffer from prolonged training times, making them impractical for many applications. In this paper, we present an efficient framework that operates without any depth or matching model. Our approach initially uses SfM to quickly obtain rough camera poses within seconds, and then refines these poses by leveraging the dense representation in 3DGS. This framework effectively addresses the issue of long training times. Additionally, we integrate the densification process with joint refinement and propose a coarse-to-fine frequency-aware densification to reconstruct different levels of details. This approach prevents camera pose estimation from being trapped in local minima or drifting due to high-frequency signals. Our method significantly reduces training time from hours to minutes while achieving more accurate novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |

The experimental work includes a real-life knee rehabilitation video dataset capturing a set of exercises from simple and personalised to more general and challenging movements aimed for returning to sport. To convert video from mobile into privacy-preserving diagnostic timeseries data, we employed Google MediaPipe pose estimation. The developed proof-of-concept algorithms can augment knee exercise videos by overlaying the patient with stick figure elements while updating generated timeseries plot with knee angle estimation streamed as CSV file format. For patients and physiotherapists, video with side-to-side timeseries visually indicating potential issues such as excessive knee flexion or unstable knee movements or stick figure overlay errors is possible by setting a-priori knee-angle parameters. To address adherence to rehabilitation programme and quantify exercise sets and repetitions, our adaptive algorithm can correctly identify (91.67%-100%) of all exercises from side- and front-view videos. Transparent algorithm design for adaptive visual analysis of various knee exercise patterns contributes towards the interpretable AI and will inform near-future privacy-preserving, non-vendor locking, open-source developments for both end-user computing devices and as on-premises non-proprietary cloud platforms that can be deployed within the national healthcare system.</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The original work citation: Ba\v{c}i\'c, B., Claudiu Vasile, Feng, C., & Ciuc\u{a}, M.

| **[Exploiting Aggregation and Segregation of Representations for Domain Adaptive Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20538v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation (HPE) has received increasing attention recently due to its wide application in motion analysis, virtual reality, healthcare, etc. However, it suffers from the lack of labeled diverse real-world datasets due to the time- and labor-intensive annotation. To cope with the label deficiency issue, one common solution is to train the HPE models with easily available synthetic datasets (source) and apply them to real-world data (target) through domain adaptation (DA). Unfortunately, prevailing domain adaptation techniques within the HPE domain remain predominantly fixated on effecting alignment and aggregation between source and target features, often sidestepping the crucial task of excluding domain-specific representations. To rectify this, we introduce a novel framework that capitalizes on both representation aggregation and segregation for domain adaptive human pose estimation. Within this framework, we address the network architecture aspect by disentangling representations into distinct domain-invariant and domain-specific components, facilitating aggregation of domain-invariant features while simultaneously segregating domain-specific ones. Moreover, we tackle the discrepancy measurement facet by delving into various keypoint relationships and applying separate aggregation or segregation mechanisms to enhance alignment. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, e.g., Human3.6M, LSP, H3D, and FreiHand, show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This approach heavily relies on the visual matching across frames. However, ambiguous matching in challenging scenarios leads to significant errors in geometric modeling and bundle adjustment optimization, which undermines the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. To address this challenge, this paper proposes MambaVO, which conducts robust initialization, Mamba-based sequential matching refinement, and smoothed training to enhance the matching quality and improve the pose estimation in deep visual odometry. Specifically, when a new frame is received, it is matched with the closest keyframe in the maintained Point-Frame Graph (PFG) via the semi-dense based Geometric Initialization Module (GIM). Then the initialized PFG is processed by a proposed Geometric Mamba Module (GMM), which exploits the matching features to refine the overall inter-frame pixel-to-pixel matching. The refined PFG is finally processed by deep BA to optimize the poses and the map. To deal with the gradient variance, a Trending-Aware Penalty (TAP) is proposed to smooth training by balancing the pose loss and the matching loss to enhance convergence and stability. A loop closure module is finally applied to enable MambaVO++. On public benchmarks, MambaVO and MambaVO++ demonstrate SOTA accuracy performance, while ensuring real-time running performance with low GPU memory requirement.

| **[Searching from Area to Point: A Hierarchical Framework for Semantic-Geometric Combined Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00194v6)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature matching is a crucial technique in computer vision. A unified perspective for this task is to treat it as a searching problem, aiming at an efficient search strategy to narrow the search space to point matches between images. One of the key aspects of search strategy is the search space, which in current approaches is not carefully defined, resulting in limited matching accuracy. This paper, thus, pays attention to the search space and proposes to set the initial search space for point matching as the matched image areas containing prominent semantic, named semantic area matches. This search space favors point matching by salient features and alleviates the accuracy limitation in recent Transformer-based matching methods. To achieve this search space, we introduce a hierarchical feature matching framework: Area to Point Matching (A2PM), to first find semantic area matches between images and later perform point matching on area matches. We further propose Semantic and Geometry Area Matching (SGAM) method to realize this framework, which utilizes semantic prior and geometry consistency to establish accurate area matches between images. By integrating SGAM with off-the-shelf state-of-the-art matchers, our method, adopting the A2PM framework, achieves encouraging precision improvements in massive point matching and pose estimation experiments.</p></details> | v3 | None |
| **[Optimizing Local-Global Dependencies for Accurate 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19676v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have recently achieved significant success in 3D human pose estimation, owing to their strong ability to model long-range dependencies. However, relying solely on the global attention mechanism is insufficient for capturing the fine-grained local details, which are crucial for accurate pose estimation. To address this, we propose SSR-STF, a dual-stream model that effectively integrates local features with global dependencies to enhance 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, we introduce SSRFormer, a simple yet effective module that employs the skeleton selective refine attention (SSRA) mechanism to capture fine-grained local dependencies in human pose sequences, complementing the global dependencies modeled by the Transformer. By adaptively fusing these two feature streams, SSR-STF can better learn the underlying structure of human poses, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods in local feature extraction. Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that SSR-STF achieves state-of-the-art performance, with P1 errors of 37.4 mm and 13.2 mm respectively, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, the motion representations learned by our model prove effective in downstream tasks such as human mesh recovery.

However, existing efforts are still struggling to generate high-quality images with consistent pose alignment, resulting in unsatisfactory output. In this paper, we propose a framework that delves into the graph relations of pose priors to provide control information for human image generation. The main idea is to establish a graph topological structure between the pose priors and latent representation of diffusion models to capture the intrinsic associations between different pose parts. A Progressive Graph Integrator (PGI) is designed to learn the spatial relationships of the pose priors with the graph structure, adopting a hierarchical strategy within an Adapter to gradually propagate information across different pose parts. Besides, a pose perception loss is introduced based on a pretrained pose estimation network to minimize the pose differences. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on the Human-Art and LAION-Human datasets clearly demonstrate that our model can achieve significant performance improvement over the latest benchmark models.

| **[Dust to Tower: Coarse-to-Fine Photo-Realistic Scene Reconstruction from Sparse Uncalibrated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19518v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-realistic scene reconstruction from sparse-view, uncalibrated images is highly required in practice. Although some successes have been made, existing methods are either Sparse-View but require accurate camera parameters (i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic), or SfM-free but need densely captured images. To combine the advantages of both methods while addressing their respective weaknesses, we propose Dust to Tower (D2T), an accurate and efficient coarse-to-fine framework to optimize 3DGS and image poses simultaneously from sparse and uncalibrated images. Our key idea is to first construct a coarse model efficiently and subsequently refine it using warped and inpainted images at novel viewpoints. To do this, we first introduce a Coarse Construction Module (CCM) which exploits a fast Multi-View Stereo model to initialize a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and recover initial camera poses. To refine the 3D model at novel viewpoints, we propose a Confidence Aware Depth Alignment (CADA) module to refine the coarse depth maps by aligning their confident parts with estimated depths by a Mono-depth model. Then, a Warped Image-Guided Inpainting (WIGI) module is proposed to warp the training images to novel viewpoints by the refined depth maps, and inpainting is applied to fulfill the ``holes" in the warped images caused by view-direction changes, providing high-quality supervision to further optimize the 3D model and the camera poses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the validity of D2T and its design choices, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of novel view synthesis and pose estimation while keeping high efficiency.

These input constraints are often unmet in real-world setups, making the approach impractical. We demonstrate that unsynchronized videos with unknown poses can generate dynamic neural fields if the videos capture human motion. Humans are one of the most common dynamic subjects whose poses can be estimated using state-of-the-art methods. While noisy, the estimated human shape and pose parameters provide a decent initialization for the highly non-convex and under-constrained problem of training a consistent dynamic neural representation. Given the sequences of pose and shape of humans, we estimate the time offsets between videos, followed by camera pose estimations by analyzing 3D joint locations. Then, we train dynamic NeRF employing multiresolution rids while simultaneously refining both time offsets and camera poses. The setup still involves optimizing many parameters, therefore, we introduce a robust progressive learning strategy to stabilize the process. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate spatiotemporal calibration and high-quality scene reconstruction in challenging conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

Our approach combines data-driven scene reconstruction with the traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) framework to achieve more accurate scene reconstruction and camera estimation, while simultaneously recovering human meshes. In contrast to existing scene reconstruction and SfM methods that lack metric scale information, our method estimates approximate metric scale by leveraging a human statistical model. Furthermore, it reconstructs multiple human meshes within the same world coordinate system alongside the scene point cloud, effectively capturing spatial relationships among individuals and their positions in the environment. We initialize the reconstruction of humans, scenes, and cameras using robust foundational models and jointly optimize these elements. This joint optimization synergistically improves the accuracy of each component. We compare our method to existing approaches on two challenging benchmarks, EgoHumans and EgoExo4D, demonstrating significant improvements in human localization accuracy within the world coordinate frame (reducing error from 3.51m to 1.04m in EgoHumans and from 2.9m to 0.56m in EgoExo4D). Notably, our results show that incorporating human data into the SfM pipeline improves camera pose estimation (e.g., increasing RRA@15 by 20.3% on EgoHumans). Additionally, qualitative results show that our approach improves overall scene reconstruction quality.

Our Simultaneous Multiple Object detection and Pose Estimation network (SMOPE-Net) is an end-to-end trainable multitasking network with a composite loss that also provides the advantages of anchor-free detections for efficient downstream pose estimation. To enable the annotation of training data for our learning objective, we develop a Twin-Space object labeling method and demonstrate its correctness analytically and empirically. Using the labeling method, we provide the KITTI-6DoF dataset with $\sim7.5$K annotated frames. Extensive experiments on KITTI-6DoF and the popular LineMod datasets show a consistent performance gain with SMOPE-Net over existing pose estimation methods.

It incorporates a surgical trocar equipped with a set of micro-cameras, which are inserted into the body cavity to provide an expanded field of view and a 3D perspective of the surgical procedure. A sophisticated deep neural network algorithm, YOLOv8-Pose, is tailored to estimate the position and orientation of surgical instruments in each individual camera view. Subsequently, 3D surgical tool pose estimation is performed using associated 2D key points across multiple views. This enables the rendering of a 3D surface model of the surgical tools overlaid on the observed background scene for real-time visualization. In this study, we explain the process of developing a training dataset for new surgical tools to customize YoLOv8-Pose while minimizing labeling efforts. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare EasyVis2 with the original EasyVis, revealing that, with the same number of cameras, the new system improves 3D reconstruction accuracy and reduces computation time.

Existing methods, even those trained on large-scale datasets, struggle in these scenarios due to the lack of identifiable correspondences or visual overlap. Inspired by the human ability to infer spatial relationships from diverse scenes, we propose a novel approach, InterPose, that leverages the rich priors encoded within pre-trained generative video models. We propose to use a video model to hallucinate intermediate frames between two input images, effectively creating a dense, visual transition, which significantly simplifies the problem of pose estimation. Since current video models can still produce implausible motion or inconsistent geometry, we introduce a self-consistency score that evaluates the consistency of pose predictions from sampled videos. We demonstrate that our approach generalizes among three state-of-the-art video models and show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art DUSt3R on four diverse datasets encompassing indoor, outdoor, and object-centric scenes.

Current state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques, often employing deep neural networks, can match human annotation in non-clinical datasets. However, they underperform in novel situations, limiting their generalisability to clinical populations with pathological movement patterns. Clinical datasets are not widely available for AI training due to ethical challenges and a lack of data collection. We observe that data from other species may be able to bridge this gap by exposing the network to a broader range of motion cues. We found that utilising data from other species and undertaking transfer learning improved human pose estimation in terms of precision and recall compared to the benchmark, which was trained on humans only. Compared to the benchmark, fewer human training examples were needed for the transfer learning approach (1,000 vs 19,185). These results suggest that macaque pose estimation can improve human pose estimation in clinical situations. Future work should further explore the utility of pose estimation trained with monkey data in clinical populations.</p></details> |  | None |

The presence of pathologies, broken structures or limited field-of-view (FOV) can all make anatomy parsing algorithms vulnerable. In this work, we explore how to leverage and implement the successful detection-then-segmentation paradigm for 3D medical data, and propose a steerable, robust, and efficient computing framework for detection, identification, and segmentation of anatomies in CT scans. Considering the complicated shapes, sizes, and orientations of anatomies, without loss of generality, we present a nine degrees of freedom (9-DoF) pose estimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage, non-hierarchical representation. Our whole framework is executed in a steerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to further boost inference efficiency. We have validated our method on three medical imaging parsing tasks: ribs, spine, and abdominal organs. For rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for quantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs. Extensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of our framework (with the identification rate of 97.0% and the segmentation Dice score of 90.9%), compared favorably against several strong baselines (e.g., CenterNet, FCOS, and nnU-Net).

Since the new approach can not only generalize well to unseen datasets, but also to different keypoints, the first multi-view multi-person whole-body estimator is presented.

Conventional methods in face analysis have often relied on task-specific designs and pre-processing techniques, which limit their scalability and integration into a unified architecture. Unlike these conventional methods, FaceXFormer leverages a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture where each task is treated as a learnable token, enabling the seamless integration and simultaneous processing of multiple tasks within a single framework. Moreover, we propose a novel parameter-efficient decoder, FaceX, which jointly processes face and task tokens, thereby learning generalized and robust face representations across different tasks. We jointly trained FaceXFormer on nine face perception datasets and conducted experiments against specialized and multi-task models in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations across multiple benchmarks, showcasing state-of-the-art or competitive performance. Further, we performed a comprehensive analysis of different backbones for unified face task processing and evaluated our model "in-the-wild", demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a single model capable of handling nine facial analysis tasks while maintaining real-time performance at 33.21 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kartik-3004.github.io/facexformer/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kartik-3004.github.io/facexformer) |

However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.</p></details> |  | None |

To enable the adoption of machine learning for space applications, one of obstacles is the demonstration that available training datasets are adequate to validate the algorithms. The objective of the study is to generate datasets of images and metadata suitable for training machine learning algorithms. Two use cases were selected and a robust methodology was developed to validate the datasets including the ground truth. The first use case is in-orbit rendezvous with a man-made object: a mockup of satellite ENVISAT. The second use case is a Lunar landing scenario. Datasets were produced from archival datasets (Chang'e 3), from the laboratory at DLR TRON facility and at Airbus Robotic laboratory, from SurRender software high fidelity image simulator using Model Capture and from Generative Adversarial Networks. The use case definition included the selection of algorithms as benchmark: an AI-based pose estimation algorithm and a dense optical flow algorithm were selected. Eventually it is demonstrated that datasets produced with SurRender and selected laboratory facilities are adequate to train machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, preprint of the proceedings of ESA SPAICE conference 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Leveraging Anthropometric Measurements to Improve Human Mesh Estimation and Ensure Consistent Body Shapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17671v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The basic body shape (i.e., the body shape in T-pose) of a person does not change within a single video. However, most SOTA human mesh estimation (HME) models output a slightly different, thus inconsistent basic body shape for each video frame. Furthermore, we find that SOTA 3D human pose estimation (HPE) models outperform HME models regarding the precision of the estimated 3D keypoint positions. We solve the problem of inconsistent body shapes by leveraging anthropometric measurements like taken by tailors from humans. We create a model called A2B that converts given anthropometric measurements to basic body shape parameters of human mesh models. We obtain superior and consistent human meshes by combining the A2B model results with the keypoints of 3D HPE models using inverse kinematics. We evaluate our approach on challenging datasets like ASPset or fit3D, where we can lower the MPJPE by over 30 mm compared to SOTA HME models. Further, replacing estimates of the body shape parameters from existing HME models with A2B results not only increases the performance of these HME models, but also guarantees consistent body shapes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Level-Set Parameters: Novel Representation for 3D Shape Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13502v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape analysis has been largely focused on traditional 3D representations of point clouds and meshes, but the discrete nature of these data makes the analysis susceptible to variations in input resolutions. Recent development of neural fields brings in level-set parameters from signed distance functions as a novel, continuous, and numerical representation of 3D shapes, where the shape surfaces are defined as zero-level-sets of those functions. This motivates us to extend shape analysis from the traditional 3D data to these novel parameter data. Since the level-set parameters are not Euclidean like point clouds, we establish correlations across different shapes by formulating them as a pseudo-normal distribution, and learn the distribution prior from the respective dataset. To further explore the level-set parameters with shape transformations, we propose to condition a subset of these parameters on rotations and translations, and generate them with a hypernetwork. This simplifies the pose-related shape analysis compared to using traditional data. We demonstrate the promise of the novel representations through applications in shape classification (arbitrary poses), retrieval, and 6D object pose estimation.

| **[Pre-training a Density-Aware Pose Transformer for Robust LiDAR-based 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13454v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of autonomous driving, LiDAR-based 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is becoming a research focus. However, due to the noise and sparsity of LiDAR-captured point clouds, robust human pose estimation remains challenging. Most of the existing methods use temporal information, multi-modal fusion, or SMPL optimization to correct biased results. In this work, we try to obtain sufficient information for 3D HPE only by modeling the intrinsic properties of low-quality point clouds. Hence, a simple yet powerful method is proposed, which provides insights both on modeling and augmentation of point clouds. Specifically, we first propose a concise and effective density-aware pose transformer (DAPT) to get stable keypoint representations. By using a set of joint anchors and a carefully designed exchange module, valid information is extracted from point clouds with different densities. Then 1D heatmaps are utilized to represent the precise locations of the keypoints. Secondly, a comprehensive LiDAR human synthesis and augmentation method is proposed to pre-train the model, enabling it to acquire a better human body prior. We increase the diversity of point clouds by randomly sampling human positions and orientations and by simulating occlusions through the addition of laser-level masks. Extensive experiments have been conducted on multiple datasets, including IMU-annotated LidarHuman26M, SLOPER4D, and manually annotated Waymo Open Dataset v2.0 (Waymo), HumanM3. Our method demonstrates SOTA performance in all scenarios. In particular, compared with LPFormer on Waymo, we reduce the average MPJPE by $10.0mm$. Compared with PRN on SLOPER4D, we notably reduce the average MPJPE by $20.7mm$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[CondiMen: Conditional Multi-Person Mesh Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13058v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-person human mesh recovery (HMR) consists in detecting all individuals in a given input image, and predicting the body shape, pose, and 3D location for each detected person. The dominant approaches to this task rely on neural networks trained to output a single prediction for each detected individual. In contrast, we propose CondiMen, a method that outputs a joint parametric distribution over likely poses, body shapes, intrinsics and distances to the camera, using a Bayesian network. This approach offers several advantages. First, a probability distribution can handle some inherent ambiguities of this task -- such as the uncertainty between a person's size and their distance to the camera, or simply the loss of information when projecting 3D data onto the 2D image plane. Second, the output distribution can be combined with additional information to produce better predictions, by using e.g. known camera or body shape parameters, or by exploiting multi-view observations. Third, one can efficiently extract the most likely predictions from the output distribution, making our proposed approach suitable for real-time applications. Empirically we find that our model i) achieves performance on par with or better than the state-of-the-art, ii) captures uncertainties and correlations inherent in pose estimation and iii) can exploit additional information at test time, such as multi-view consistency or body shape priors. CondiMen spices up the modeling of ambiguity, using just the right ingredients on hand.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort. The benchmark, the dataset, and the annotation pipeline will be publicly available at https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publishing at The 2024 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen) |

However, many applications require higher precision at the frame level. In this work, we propose a novel task, BestShot, which aims to locate highlight frames within human-centric videos via language queries. This task demands not only a deep semantic comprehension of human actions but also precise temporal localization. To support this task, we introduce the BestShot Benchmark. %The benchmark is meticulously constructed by combining human detection and tracking, potential frame selection based on human judgment, and detailed textual descriptions crafted by human input to ensure precision. The benchmark is meticulously constructed by combining human-annotated highlight frames, detailed textual descriptions and duration labeling. These descriptions encompass three critical elements: (1) Visual content; (2) Fine-grained action; and (3) Human Pose Description. Together, these elements provide the necessary precision to identify the exact highlight frames in videos. To tackle this problem, we have collected two distinct datasets: (i) ShotGPT4o Dataset, which is algorithmically generated by GPT-4o and (ii) Image-SMPLText Dataset, a dataset with large-scale and accurate per-frame pose description leveraging PoseScript and existing pose estimation datasets. Based on these datasets, we present a strong baseline model, ShotVL, fine-tuned from InternVL, specifically for BestShot. We highlight the impressive zero-shot capabilities of our model and offer comparative analyses with existing SOTA models. ShotVL demonstrates a significant 52% improvement over InternVL on the BestShot Benchmark and a notable 57% improvement on the THUMOS14 Benchmark, all while maintaining the SOTA performance in general image classification and retrieval.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we introduce InCrowd-VI, a novel visual-inertial dataset specifically designed for human navigation in indoor pedestrian-rich environments. Recorded using Meta Aria Project glasses, it captures realistic scenarios without environmental control. InCrowd-VI features 58 sequences totaling a 5 km trajectory length and 1.5 hours of recording time, including RGB, stereo images, and IMU measurements. The dataset captures important challenges such as pedestrian occlusions, varying crowd densities, complex layouts, and lighting changes. Ground-truth trajectories, accurate to approximately 2 cm, are provided in the dataset, originating from the Meta Aria project machine perception SLAM service. In addition, a semi-dense 3D point cloud of scenes is provided for each sequence. The evaluation of state-of-the-art visual odometry (VO) and SLAM algorithms on InCrowd-VI revealed severe performance limitations in these realistic scenarios. Under challenging conditions, systems exceeded the required localization accuracy of 0.5 meters and the 1\% drift threshold, with classical methods showing drift up to 5-10\%. While deep learning-based approaches maintained high pose estimation coverage (>90\%), they failed to achieve real-time processing speeds necessary for walking pace navigation. These results demonstrate the need and value of a new dataset to advance SLAM research for visually impaired navigation in complex indoor environments. The dataset and associated tools are publicly available at https://incrowd-vi.cloudlab.zhaw.ch/.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Widely used structure-from-motion pipelines encounter difficulties in accurately tracking the camera trajectory when faced with separate dynamics of the scene content and the camera movement. To address this challenge, we propose Dynamic Motion-Aware Fast and Robust Camera Localization for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (DynaMoN). DynaMoN utilizes semantic segmentation and generic motion masks to handle dynamic content for initial camera pose estimation and statics-focused ray sampling for fast and accurate novel-view synthesis. Our novel iterative learning scheme switches between training the NeRF and updating the pose parameters for an improved reconstruction and trajectory estimation quality. The proposed pipeline shows significant acceleration of the training process. We extensively evaluate our approach on two real-world dynamic datasets, the TUM RGB-D dataset and the BONN RGB-D Dynamic dataset. DynaMoN improves over the state-of-the-art both in terms of reconstruction quality and trajectory accuracy. We plan to make our code public to enhance research in this area.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach relies on the evaluation of discrepancies in the geometry of the observed object, in particular its respective estimated back-projection in 3D, against a putative functional shape representation comprising mixtures of Gaussian Processes, that act as a template. Each Gaussian Process is trained to yield a fragment of the object's surface in a radial fashion with respect to designated reference points. We further define a pose confidence measure as the average probability of pixel back-projections in the Gaussian mixture. The goal of our experiments is two-fold. a) We demonstrate that our functional representation is sufficiently accurate as a shape template on which the probability of back-projected object points can be evaluated, and, b) we show that the resulting confidence scores based on these probabilities are indeed a consistent quality measure of pose.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Joint Identity Verification and Pose Alignment for Partial Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03959v4)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, portable electronic devices are becoming more and more popular. For lightweight considerations, their fingerprint recognition modules usually use limited-size sensors. However, partial fingerprints have few matchable features, especially when there are differences in finger pressing posture or image quality, which makes partial fingerprint verification challenging. Most existing methods regard fingerprint position rectification and identity verification as independent tasks, ignoring the coupling relationship between them -- relative pose estimation typically relies on paired features as anchors, and authentication accuracy tends to improve with more precise pose alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for joint identity verification and pose alignment of partial fingerprint pairs, aiming to leverage their inherent correlation to improve each other. To achieve this, we present a multi-task CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-Transformer hybrid network, and design a pre-training task to enhance the feature extraction capability. Experiments on multiple public datasets (NIST SD14, FVC2002 DB1A & DB3A, FVC2004 DB1A & DB2A, FVC2006 DB1A) and an in-house dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both partial fingerprint verification and relative pose estimation, while being more efficient than previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 2024</p></details> | None |

Most current approaches are restricted to specific instances with known models or require ground truth depth information or point cloud captures from LIDAR. We tackle the harder problem of pose estimation for category-level objects from a single RGB image. We propose a novel solution that eliminates the need for specific object models or depth information. Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate object pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the object. Unlike previous methods that rely on costly trained likelihood estimators to remove outliers before pose aggregation using mean pooling, we introduce a simpler approach using Mean Shift to estimate the mode of the distribution as the final pose estimate. Our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the REAL275 dataset by a significant margin.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs.

Map-aided localization is a universal approach to overcome the limitations of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) in challenging environments. However, current solutions face challenges in terms of mapping flexibility, storage burden and re-localization performance. In this work, we present SF-Loc, a lightweight visual mapping and map-aided localization system, whose core idea is the map representation based on sparse frames with dense but compact depth, termed as visual structure frames. In the mapping phase, multi-sensor dense bundle adjustment (MS-DBA) is applied to construct geo-referenced visual structure frames. The local co-visbility is checked to keep the map sparsity and achieve incremental mapping. In the localization phase, coarse-to-fine vision-based localization is performed, in which multi-frame information and the map distribution are fully integrated. To be specific, the concept of spatially smoothed similarity (SSS) is proposed to overcome the place ambiguity, and pairwise frame matching is applied for efficient and robust pose estimation. Experimental results on the cross-season dataset verify the effectiveness of the system. In complex urban road scenarios, the map size is down to 3 MB per kilometer and stable decimeter-level re-localization can be achieved. The code will be made open-source soon (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/SF-Loc).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/SF-Loc) |

However, existing methods face challenges such as Gaussian primitives redundancy, forgetting problem during continuous optimization, and difficulty in initializing primitives in monocular case due to lack of depth information. In order to achieve efficient and photorealistic mapping, we propose RP-SLAM, a 3D Gaussian splatting-based vision SLAM method for monocular and RGB-D cameras. RP-SLAM decouples camera poses estimation from Gaussian primitives optimization and consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose an efficient incremental mapping approach to achieve a compact and accurate representation of the scene through adaptive sampling and Gaussian primitives filtering. Secondly, a dynamic window optimization method is proposed to mitigate the forgetting problem and improve map consistency. Finally, for the monocular case, a monocular keyframe initialization method based on sparse point cloud is proposed to improve the initialization accuracy of Gaussian primitives, which provides a geometric basis for subsequent optimization. The results of numerous experiments demonstrate that RP-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art map rendering accuracy while ensuring real-time performance and model compactness.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem, namely, the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce the Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image, one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object, and the other to a canonical version of the object at rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction, seeing through self-occlusions to obtain the complete shape of the object. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation reduce to the prediction of the DualPMs. We demonstrate empirically that this representation is a good target for a deep network to predict; specifically, we consider modeling horses, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on 3D synthetic data, consisting of a single model of a horse, while generalizing very well to real images. With this, we improve by a large margin previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of this type of objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

| **[Drift-free Visual SLAM using Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08496v2)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a 6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system. Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging zero-shot pose estimation, our approach enables the robot to automatically obtain training data without manual labeling. After pose estimation the object is grasped, and in-hand pose estimation is used for data validation. Our pipeline allows the system to fine-tune while the process is running, removing the need for a learning phase. The motivation behind our work lies in the need for rapid setup of pose estimation solutions. Specifically, we address the challenging task of bin picking, which plays a pivotal role in flexible robotic setups.

| **[BLADE: Single-view Body Mesh Learning through Accurate Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08640v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-image human mesh recovery is a challenging task due to the ill-posed nature of simultaneous body shape, pose, and camera estimation. Existing estimators work well on images taken from afar, but they break down as the person moves close to the camera. Moreover, current methods fail to achieve both accurate 3D pose and 2D alignment at the same time. Error is mainly introduced by inaccurate perspective projection heuristically derived from orthographic parameters. To resolve this long-standing challenge, we present our method BLADE which accurately recovers perspective parameters from a single image without heuristic assumptions. We start from the inverse relationship between perspective distortion and the person's Z-translation Tz, and we show that Tz can be reliably estimated from the image. We then discuss the important role of Tz for accurate human mesh recovery estimated from close-range images. Finally, we show that, once Tz and the 3D human mesh are estimated, one can accurately recover the focal length and full 3D translation. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world close-range images show that our method is the first to accurately recover projection parameters from a single image, and consequently attain state-of-the-art accuracy on 3D pose estimation and 2D alignment for a wide range of images. https://research.nvidia.com/labs/amri/projects/blade/</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, deep neural networks that directly regress camera poses have gained popularity due to their fast inference capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to either generalize well to new scenes or provide accurate camera pose estimates. To address these issues, we present \textbf{Reloc3r}, a simple yet effective visual localization framework. It consists of an elegantly designed relative pose regression network, and a minimalist motion averaging module for absolute pose estimation. Trained on approximately 8 million posed image pairs, Reloc3r achieves surprisingly good performance and generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 public datasets, consistently demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. It provides high-quality camera pose estimates in real time and generalizes to novel scenes.

| **[Towards Aerial Collaborative Stereo: Real-Time Cross-Camera Feature Association and Relative Pose Estimation for UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17504v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collaborative visual perception of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increasingly become a research hotspot. Compared to a single UAV equipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision offers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible and large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a collaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on two UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two UAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras are continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this aerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly real-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and relative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these challenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association algorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the relative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry (VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer NVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time performance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior to traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under different initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential application of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in urban scenarios. We hope this work can serve as a foundational study for more multi-UAV collaborative vision research. Online video: https://youtu.be/avxMuOf5Qcw</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

To improve on top of prior work, we develop a method to generate and score multiple hypotheses during training, effectively integrating uncertainty quantification into the learning process. This process results in a deep uncertainty function that is trained end-to-end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned deep uncertainty model is used as the conformity score, which can be used to calibrate a conformal predictor in order to assess the quality of the output prediction. Since the data in human pose-shape learning is not fully exchangeable, we also present two practical bounds for the coverage gap in conformal prediction, developing theoretical backing for the uncertainty bound of our model. Our results indicate that by taking advantage of deep uncertainty with conformal prediction, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[LoRA3D: Low-Rank Self-Calibration of 3D Geometric Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07746v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging 3D geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, offer a promising approach for in-the-wild 3D vision tasks. However, due to the high-dimensional nature of the problem space and scarcity of high-quality 3D data, these pre-trained models still struggle to generalize to many challenging circumstances, such as limited view overlap or low lighting. To address this, we propose LoRA3D, an efficient self-calibration pipeline to $\textit{specialize}$ the pre-trained models to target scenes using their own multi-view predictions. Taking sparse RGB images as input, we leverage robust optimization techniques to refine multi-view predictions and align them into a global coordinate frame. In particular, we incorporate prediction confidence into the geometric optimization process, automatically re-weighting the confidence to better reflect point estimation accuracy. We use the calibrated confidence to generate high-quality pseudo labels for the calibrating views and use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the models on the pseudo-labeled data. Our method does not require any external priors or manual labels. It completes the self-calibration process on a $\textbf{single standard GPU within just 5 minutes}$. Each low-rank adapter requires only $\textbf{18MB}$ of storage. We evaluated our method on $\textbf{more than 160 scenes}$ from the Replica, TUM and Waymo Open datasets, achieving up to $\textbf{88% performance improvement}$ on 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation and novel-view rendering.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they only process a pair of views at a time to infer pixel-aligned pointmaps. When dealing with more than two views, a combinatorial number of error prone pairwise reconstructions are usually followed by an expensive global optimization, which often fails to rectify the pairwise reconstruction errors. To handle more views, reduce errors, and improve inference time, we propose the fast single-stage feed-forward network MV-DUSt3R. At its core are multi-view decoder blocks which exchange information across any number of views while considering one reference view. To make our method robust to reference view selection, we further propose MV-DUSt3R+, which employs cross-reference-view blocks to fuse information across different reference view choices. To further enable novel view synthesis, we extend both by adding and jointly training Gaussian splatting heads. Experiments on multi-view stereo reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, and novel view synthesis confirm that our methods improve significantly upon prior art.

However, endoscopy systems are monocular, and existing methods relying on synthetic datasets or complex models often lack generalizability in challenging endoscopic conditions. We propose a robust self-supervised monocular depth and pose estimation framework that incorporates a Generative Latent Bank and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The Generative Latent Bank leverages extensive depth scenes from natural images to condition the depth network, enhancing realism and robustness of depth predictions through latent feature priors. For pose estimation, we reformulate it within a VAE framework, treating pose transitions as latent variables to regularize scale, stabilize z-axis prominence, and improve x-y sensitivity. This dual refinement pipeline enables accurate depth and pose predictions, effectively addressing the GI tract's complex textures and lighting. Extensive evaluations on SimCol and EndoSLAM datasets confirm our framework's superior performance over published self-supervised methods in endoscopic depth and pose estimation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current SCR methods often face challenges in handling repetitive textures and meaningless areas due to their reliance on implicit triangulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient scene coordinate encoding and relocalization method. Compared with the existing SCR methods, we design a unified architecture for both scene encoding and salient keypoint detection, enabling our system to focus on encoding informative regions, thereby significantly enhancing efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism that leverages sequential information during both map encoding and relocalization, which strengthens implicit triangulation, particularly in repetitive texture environments. Comprehensive experiments conducted across indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) SCR methods. Our single-frame relocalization mode improves the recall rate of our baseline by 6.4% and increases the running speed from 56Hz to 90Hz. Furthermore, our sequence-based mode increases the recall rate by 11% while maintaining the original efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, existing methods generally exhibit suboptimal performance under extreme conditions such as significant appearance changes and domain shifts. In this study, we introduce a multi-level feature aggregation network that incorporates two pivotal components to facilitate the learning of robust and accurate features with domain adaptation. First, we employ domain adaptation supervision to align high-level feature distributions across different domains to achieve invariant domain representations. Second, we propose a Transformer-based booster that enhances descriptor robustness by integrating visual and geometric information through wave position encoding concepts, effectively handling complex conditions. To ensure the accuracy and robustness of features, we adopt a hierarchical architecture to capture comprehensive information and apply meticulous targeted supervision to keypoint detection, descriptor extraction, and their coupled processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, RADA, achieves excellent results in image matching, camera pose estimation, and visual localization tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Currently, most unsupervised 3D keypoint detection methods focus on the rigid-body objects. However, when faced with deformable objects, the keypoints they identify do not preserve semantic consistency well. In this paper, we introduce an innovative unsupervised keypoint detector Key-Grid for both the rigid-body and deformable objects, which is an autoencoder framework. The encoder predicts keypoints and the decoder utilizes the generated keypoints to reconstruct the objects. Unlike previous work, we leverage the identified keypoint in formation to form a 3D grid feature heatmap called grid heatmap, which is used in the decoder section. Grid heatmap is a novel concept that represents the latent variables for grid points sampled uniformly in the 3D cubic space, where these variables are the shortest distance between the grid points and the skeleton connected by keypoint pairs. Meanwhile, we incorporate the information from each layer of the encoder into the decoder section. We conduct an extensive evaluation of Key-Grid on a list of benchmark datasets. Key-Grid achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the semantic consistency and position accuracy of keypoints. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of Key-Grid to noise and downsampling. In addition, we achieve SE-(3) invariance of keypoints though generalizing Key-Grid to a SE(3)-invariant backbone.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods depend on external multi-view alignment processes, such as explicit pose estimation or pre-reconstruction, which limits their flexibility and accessibility, especially when alignment is unstable due to insufficient overlap or occlusions between views. In this paper, we propose NVComposer, a novel approach that eliminates the need for explicit external alignment. NVComposer enables the generative model to implicitly infer spatial and geometric relationships between multiple conditional views by introducing two key components: 1) an image-pose dual-stream diffusion model that simultaneously generates target novel views and condition camera poses, and 2) a geometry-aware feature alignment module that distills geometric priors from dense stereo models during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NVComposer achieves state-of-the-art performance in generative multi-view NVS tasks, removing the reliance on external alignment and thus improving model accessibility. Our approach shows substantial improvements in synthesis quality as the number of unposed input views increases, highlighting its potential for more flexible and accessible generative NVS systems.

We envision a future service scenario where wireless sensing service providers distribute sensing models to users. During usage, users might request new sensing capabilities. For example, if someone is away from home on a business trip or vacation for an extended period, they may want a new sensing capability that can detect falls in elderly parents or grandparents and promptly alert them. In this paper, we propose CCS (continuous customized service), enabling model updates on users' local computing resources without data transmission to the service providers. To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in model updates where updating model parameters to implement new capabilities leads to the loss of existing capabilities we design knowledge distillation and weight alignment modules. These modules enable the sensing model to acquire new capabilities while retaining the existing ones. We conducted extensive experiments on the large-scale XRF55 dataset across Wi-Fi, millimeter-wave radar, and RFID modalities to simulate scenarios where four users sequentially introduced new customized demands. The results affirm that CCS excels in continuous model services across all the above wireless modalities, significantly outperforming existing approaches like OneFi.</p></details> | 9 pages,8 figures | None |

DINO-X employs the same Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture as Grounding DINO 1.5 to pursue an object-level representation for open-world object understanding. To make long-tailed object detection easy, DINO-X extends its input options to support text prompt, visual prompt, and customized prompt. With such flexible prompt options, we develop a universal object prompt to support prompt-free open-world detection, making it possible to detect anything in an image without requiring users to provide any prompt. To enhance the model's core grounding capability, we have constructed a large-scale dataset with over 100 million high-quality grounding samples, referred to as Grounding-100M, for advancing the model's open-vocabulary detection performance. Pre-training on such a large-scale grounding dataset leads to a foundational object-level representation, which enables DINO-X to integrate multiple perception heads to simultaneously support multiple object perception and understanding tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, object captioning, object-based QA, etc. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DINO-X. Specifically, the DINO-X Pro model achieves 56.0 AP, 59.8 AP, and 52.4 AP on the COCO, LVIS-minival, and LVIS-val zero-shot object detection benchmarks, respectively. Notably, it scores 63.3 AP and 56.5 AP on the rare classes of LVIS-minival and LVIS-val benchmarks, improving the previous SOTA performance by 5.8 AP and 5.0 AP. Such a result underscores its significantly improved capacity for recognizing long-tailed objects.</p></details> | Technical Report | None |

This approach leverages the advantages of normalizing flows in non-Euclidean geometries to address uncertain poses. Specifically, our method employs normalizing flow tailored to the SO(3) rotational group, incorporating a coupling mechanism based on the M\"obius transformation. This enables the framework to accurately represent any distribution on SO(3), effectively addressing issues related to discontinuities. Additionally, we reinterpret the challenge of reconstructing 3D human figures from 2D pixel-aligned inputs as the task of mapping these inputs to a range of probable poses. This perspective acknowledges the intrinsic ambiguity of the task and facilitates a straightforward integration method for multi-view scenarios. The combination of these strategies showcases the effectiveness of probabilistic models in complex scenarios for human pose estimation techniques. Our approach notably surpasses existing methods in the field of pose estimation.

This data shortage is primarily due to the prohibitive costs and inherent complexities of space operations. While existing datasets, predominantly relying on computer-simulated data, have partially addressed this gap, they present notable limitations. Firstly, these datasets often utilize proprietary image generation tools, restricting the evaluation of navigation methods in novel, unseen scenarios. Secondly, they provide limited ground-truth data, typically focusing solely on the spacecraft's translation and rotation relative to the camera. To address these limitations, we present SPIN (SPacecraft Imagery for Navigation), an open-source spacecraft image generation tool designed to support a wide range of visual navigation scenarios in space, with a particular focus on relative navigation tasks. SPIN provides multiple modalities of ground-truth data and allows researchers to employ custom 3D models of satellites, define specific camera-relative poses, and adjust settings such as camera parameters or environmental illumination conditions. We also propose a method for exploiting our tool as a data augmentation module. We validate our tool on the spacecraft pose estimation task by training with a SPIN-generated replica of SPEED+, reaching a 47% average error reduction on SPEED+ testbed data (that simulates realistic space conditions), further reducing it to a 60% error reduction when using SPIN as a data augmentation method. Both the SPIN tool (and source code) and our SPIN-generated version of SPEED+ will be publicly released upon paper acceptance on GitHub. https://github.com/vpulab/SPIN</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/vpulab/SPIN) |

The classical framework of analysis by synthesis casts this inference as a joint optimization seeking to explain the observed pixels, and recent instantiations learn expressive 3D representations (e.g., Neural Fields) with gradient-descent-based pose refinement of initial pose estimates. However, given a sparse set of observed views, the observations may not provide sufficient direct evidence to obtain complete and accurate 3D. Moreover, large errors in pose estimation may not be easily corrected and can further degrade the inferred 3D. To allow robust 3D reconstruction and pose estimation in this challenging setup, we propose SparseAGS, a method that adapts this analysis-by-synthesis approach by: a) including novel-view-synthesis-based generative priors in conjunction with photometric objectives to improve the quality of the inferred 3D, and b) explicitly reasoning about outliers and using a discrete search with a continuous optimization-based strategy to correct them. We validate our framework across real-world and synthetic datasets in combination with several off-the-shelf pose estimation systems as initialization. We find that it significantly improves the base systems' pose accuracy while yielding high-quality 3D reconstructions that outperform the results from current multi-view reconstruction baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

We propose a novel visual place recognition approach based on overlap prediction, called VOP, shifting from traditional reliance on global image similarities and local features to image overlap prediction. VOP proceeds co-visible image sections by obtaining patch-level embeddings using a Vision Transformer backbone and establishing patch-to-patch correspondences without requiring expensive feature detection and matching. Our approach uses a voting mechanism to assess overlap scores for potential database images. It provides a nuanced image retrieval metric in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that VOP leads to more accurate relative pose estimation and localization results on the retrieved image pairs than state-of-the-art baselines on a number of large-scale, real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

| **[STRIDE: Single-video based Temporally Continuous Occlusion-Robust 3D Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16221v4)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capability to accurately estimate 3D human poses is crucial for diverse fields such as action recognition, gait recognition, and virtual/augmented reality. However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field is the accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion. Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lack of temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-based models benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations when faced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. This challenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond their training datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in the training data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-video based TempoRally contInuous Occlusion-Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novel Test-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video. This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered during the model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisy initial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during test time, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our framework demonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use any off-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporal consistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where it not only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimation models but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions, achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.

However, estimating these interactions from an egocentric camera perspective is challenging, largely due to the lack of comprehensive datasets that provide both accurate hand poses on contacting surfaces and detailed annotations of pressure information. In this paper, we introduce EgoPressure, a novel egocentric dataset that captures detailed touch contact and pressure interactions. EgoPressure provides high-resolution pressure intensity annotations for each contact point and includes accurate hand pose meshes obtained through our proposed multi-view, sequence-based optimization method processing data from an 8-camera capture rig. Our dataset comprises 5 hours of recorded interactions from 21 participants captured simultaneously by one head-mounted and seven stationary Kinect cameras, which acquire RGB images and depth maps at 30 Hz. To support future research and benchmarking, we present several baseline models for estimating applied pressure on external surfaces from RGB images, with and without hand pose information. We further explore the joint estimation of the hand mesh and applied pressure. Our experiments demonstrate that pressure and hand pose are complementary for understanding hand-object interactions. ng of hand-object interactions in AR/VR and robotics research.

Spontaneous motor activity, or 'kinetics', is shown to provide a powerful surrogate measure of upcoming neurodevelopment. However, its assessment is by and large qualitative and subjective, focusing on visually identified, age-specific gestures. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Age (KA), a novel data-driven metric that quantifies neurodevelopmental maturity by predicting an infant's age based on their movement patterns. KA offers an interpretable and generalizable proxy for motor development. Our method leverages 3D video recordings of infants, processed with pose estimation to extract spatio-temporal series of anatomical landmarks, which are released as a new openly available dataset. These data are modeled using adaptive graph convolutional networks, able to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies in infant movements. We also show that our data-driven approach achieves improvement over traditional machine learning baselines based on manually engineered features.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures.

Existing monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow FoV and are fragile in textureless environments with degenerated accuracy and limited robustness. Thus multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide redundancy for texture degeneration with wide FoV. However, current multi-camera SLAM systems face massive data processing pressure and elaborately designed camera configurations, leading to estimation failures for arbitrarily arranged multi-camera systems. To address these problems, we propose a generic visual odometry for arbitrarily arranged multi-cameras, which can achieve metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras' arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature extraction and tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple video streams. Then we use the rigid constraints between cameras to estimate the metric scale poses for robust SLAM system initialization. Finally, we fuse the features of the multi-cameras in the SLAM back-end to achieve robust pose estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate the robustness of our method over arbitrarily placed cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose estimation accuracy with better generalization ability.

While Visual Odometry (VO) can offer a reasonable estimation of the robot's state, traditional VO methods encounter challenges when confronted with dynamic objects in the scene. Alternatively, an upward-facing camera can be utilized to track the robot's movement relative to the ceiling, which represents a static and consistent space. We introduce in this paper Ceiling-DSO, a ceiling-vision system based on Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO). Unlike other ceiling-vision systems, Ceiling-DSO takes advantage of the versatile formulation of DSO, avoiding assumptions about observable shapes or landmarks on the ceiling. This approach ensures the method's applicability to various ceiling types. Since no publicly available dataset for ceiling-vision exists, we created a custom dataset in a real-world scenario and employed it to evaluate our approach. By adjusting DSO parameters, we identified the optimal fit for online pose estimation, resulting in acceptable error rates compared to ground truth. We provide in this paper a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained results.</p></details> |  | None |

Addressing this need, our paper introduces EgoCast, a bimodal method for 3D human pose forecasting using egocentric videos and proprioceptive data. We study the task of human pose forecasting in a realistic setting, extending the boundaries of temporal forecasting in dynamic scenes and building on the current framework for current pose estimation in the wild. We introduce a current-frame estimation module that generates pseudo-groundtruth poses for inference, eliminating the need for past groundtruth poses typically required by current methods during forecasting. Our experimental results on the recent Ego-Exo4D and Aria Digital Twin datasets validate EgoCast for real-life motion estimation. On the Ego-Exo4D Body Pose 2024 Challenge, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, laying the groundwork for future research in human pose estimation and forecasting in unscripted activities with egocentric inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, state-of-the-art models ignore out-of-image keypoints and use uncalibrated heatmaps as keypoint location representations. To address these limitations, we propose ProbPose, which predicts for each keypoint: a calibrated probability of keypoint presence at each location in the activation window, the probability of being outside of it, and its predicted visibility. To address the lack of evaluation protocols for out-of-image keypoints, we introduce the CropCOCO dataset and the Extended OKS (Ex-OKS) metric, which extends OKS to out-of-image points. Tested on COCO, CropCOCO, and OCHuman, ProbPose shows significant gains in out-of-image keypoint localization while also improving in-image localization through data augmentation. Additionally, the model improves robustness along the edges of the bounding box and offers better flexibility in keypoint evaluation.

This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

| **[Towards Cross-View-Consistent Self-Supervised Surround Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04041v3)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation is a cornerstone for autonomous driving, yet acquiring per-pixel depth ground truth for supervised learning is challenging. Self-Supervised Surround Depth Estimation (SSSDE) from consecutive images offers an economical alternative. While previous SSSDE methods have proposed different mechanisms to fuse information across images, few of them explicitly consider the cross-view constraints, leading to inferior performance, particularly in overlapping regions. This paper proposes an efficient and consistent pose estimation design and two loss functions to enhance cross-view consistency for SSSDE. For pose estimation, we propose to use only front-view images to reduce training memory and sustain pose estimation consistency. The first loss function is the dense depth consistency loss, which penalizes the difference between predicted depths in overlapping regions. The second one is the multi-view reconstruction consistency loss, which aims to maintain consistency between reconstruction from spatial and spatial-temporal contexts. Additionally, we introduce a novel flipping augmentation to improve the performance further. Our techniques enable a simple neural model to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets. Last but not least, our proposed techniques can be easily applied to other methods.

Previously such a scheme was difficult due to head pose data sparsity, making triplet sampling infeasible. Recent progress in 3D generative adversarial networks (3D-aware GAN) has opened the door for easily sampling triplets (anchor, positive, negative). We perform contrastive learning on extensively augmented data including geometric transformations and demonstrate that contrastive learning allows networks to learn genuine features that contribute to accurate HPE. On the other hand, we observe that existing HPE works struggle to predict head poses as accurately when test image rotation matrices are slightly out of the training dataset distribution. Experiments show that our methodology performs on par with state-of-the-art models on standard test datasets and outperforms them when images are slightly rotated/ flipped or full range head pose. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to deliver a true full range HPE model capable of accurately predicting any head pose including upside-down pose. Furthermore, we compared with other existing full-yaw range models and demonstrated superior results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[emg2pose: A Large and Diverse Benchmark for Surface Electromyographic Hand Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02725v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hands are the primary means through which humans interact with the world. Reliable and always-available hand pose inference could yield new and intuitive control schemes for human-computer interactions, particularly in virtual and augmented reality. Computer vision is effective but requires one or multiple cameras and can struggle with occlusions, limited field of view, and poor lighting. Wearable wrist-based surface electromyography (sEMG) presents a promising alternative as an always-available modality sensing muscle activities that drive hand motion. However, sEMG signals are strongly dependent on user anatomy and sensor placement, and existing sEMG models have required hundreds of users and device placements to effectively generalize. To facilitate progress on sEMG pose inference, we introduce the emg2pose benchmark, the largest publicly available dataset of high-quality hand pose labels and wrist sEMG recordings. emg2pose contains 2kHz, 16 channel sEMG and pose labels from a 26-camera motion capture rig for 193 users, 370 hours, and 29 stages with diverse gestures - a scale comparable to vision-based hand pose datasets. We provide competitive baselines and challenging tasks evaluating real-world generalization scenarios: held-out users, sensor placements, and stages. emg2pose provides the machine learning community a platform for exploring complex generalization problems, holding potential to significantly enhance the development of sEMG-based human-computer interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> | None |

Recent work has addressed this problem by conditioning pose estimation with detected bounding boxes or bottom-up-estimated poses. Unfortunately, all of these approaches overlooked segmentation masks and their connection to estimated keypoints. We condition pose estimation model by segmentation masks instead of bounding boxes to improve instance separation. This improves top-down pose estimation in multi-body scenarios but does not fix detection errors. Consequently, we develop BBox-Mask-Pose (BMP), integrating detection, segmentation and pose estimation into self-improving feedback loop. We adapt detector and pose estimation model for conditioning by instance masks and use Segment Anything as pose-to-mask model to close the circle. With only small models, BMP is superior to top-down methods on OCHuman dataset and to detector-free methods on COCO dataset, combining the best from both approaches and matching state of art performance in both settings.

While research in model-based 6D object pose estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \& tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a real-world setting.</p></details> |  | None |

This paradigm induces redundant computation and cumulative errors. In this work, we propose HandOS, an end-to-end framework for 3D hand reconstruction. Our central motivation lies in leveraging a frozen detector as the foundation while incorporating auxiliary modules for 2D and 3D keypoint estimation. In this manner, we integrate the pose estimation capacity into the detection framework, while at the same time obviating the necessity of using the left-right category as a prerequisite. Specifically, we propose an interactive 2D-3D decoder, where 2D joint semantics is derived from detection cues while 3D representation is lifted from those of 2D joints. Furthermore, hierarchical attention is designed to enable the concurrent modeling of 2D joints, 3D vertices, and camera translation. Consequently, we achieve an end-to-end integration of hand detection, 2D pose estimation, and 3D mesh reconstruction within a one-stage framework, so that the above multi-stage drawbacks are overcome. Meanwhile, the HandOS reaches state-of-the-art performances on public benchmarks, e.g., 5.0 PA-MPJPE on FreiHand and 64.6\% PCK@0.05 on HInt-Ego4D.

These are usually tedious and cumbersome to obtain, yet they are mandatory to triangulate corresponding pixels in 3D space, which is the core of all best performing MVS algorithms. In this work, we take an opposite stance and introduce DUSt3R, a radically novel paradigm for Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections, i.e. operating without prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. We cast the pairwise reconstruction problem as a regression of pointmaps, relaxing the hard constraints of usual projective camera models. We show that this formulation smoothly unifies the monocular and binocular reconstruction cases. In the case where more than two images are provided, we further propose a simple yet effective global alignment strategy that expresses all pairwise pointmaps in a common reference frame. We base our network architecture on standard Transformer encoders and decoders, allowing us to leverage powerful pretrained models. Our formulation directly provides a 3D model of the scene as well as depth information, but interestingly, we can seamlessly recover from it, pixel matches, relative and absolute camera. Exhaustive experiments on all these tasks showcase that the proposed DUSt3R can unify various 3D vision tasks and set new SoTAs on monocular/multi-view depth estimation as well as relative pose estimation. In summary, DUSt3R makes many geometric 3D vision tasks easy.</p></details> | <details><summary>fixin...</summary><p>fixing the ref for StaticThings3D dataset</p></details> | None |

Although CNN-based and Transformer-based methods have achieved breakthrough progress, they often fail to deliver superior performance and real-time speed. This paper introduces MamKPD, the first efficient yet effective mamba-based pose estimation framework for 2D keypoint detection. The conventional Mamba module exhibits limited information interaction between patches. To address this, we propose a lightweight contextual modeling module (CMM) that uses depth-wise convolutions to model inter-patch dependencies and linear layers to distill the pose cues within each patch. Subsequently, by combining Mamba for global modeling across all patches, MamKPD effectively extracts instances' pose information. We conduct extensive experiments on human and animal pose estimation datasets to validate the effectiveness of MamKPD. Our MamKPD-L achieves 77.3% AP on the COCO dataset with 1492 FPS on an NVIDIA GTX 4090 GPU. Moreover, MamKPD achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPII dataset and competitive results on the AP-10K dataset while saving 85% of the parameters compared to ViTPose.

Related methods usually suffer from inconsistency between the 2D texture and 3D geometry, neglecting the intensity features in the LiDAR point cloud. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal visual relocalization system in prior LiDAR maps utilizing intensity textures, which consists of three main modules: map projection, coarse retrieval, and fine relocalization. In the map projection module, we construct the database of intensity channel map images leveraging the dense characteristic of panoramic projection. The coarse retrieval module retrieves the top-K most similar map images to the query image from the database, and retains the top-K' results by covisibility clustering. The fine relocalization module applies a two-stage 2D-3D association and a covisibility inlier selection method to obtain robust correspondences for 6DoF pose estimation. The experimental results on our self-collected datasets demonstrate the effectiveness in both place recognition and pose estimation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
