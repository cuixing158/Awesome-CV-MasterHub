| **[Heuristical Comparison of Vision Transformers Against Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09101v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently brought a new wave of research in the field of computer vision. These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT.

SQ-GAN employs off-the-shelf semantic semantic segmentation and a new specifically developed semantic-conditioned adaptive mask module (SAMM) to selectively encode semantically significant features of the images. SQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art image compression schemes such as JPEG2000 and BPG across multiple metrics, including perceptual quality and semantic segmentation accuracy on the post-decoding reconstructed image, at extreme low compression rates expressed in bits per pixel.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FLARES: Fast and Accurate LiDAR Multi-Range Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09274v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is a critical yet challenging task in autonomous driving, primarily due to the irregularity and sparsity of LiDAR data, as well as the computational demands of processing large-scale point clouds. Recent methods leverage the range-view representation to improve processing efficiency. To mitigate the performance drop caused by information loss inherent to the "many-to-one" problem, where multiple nearby 3D points are mapped to the same 2D grids and only the closest is retained, prior works tend to choose a higher azimuth resolution for range-view projection. However, this can bring the drawback of reducing the proportion of pixels that carry information and heavier computation within the network. We argue that it is not the optimal solution and show that, in contrast, decreasing the resolution is more advantageous in both efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we present a comprehensive re-design of the workflow for range-view-based LiDAR semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses data representation, augmentation, and post-processing methods for improvements. Through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we demonstrate that our pipeline significantly enhances the performance of various network architectures over their baselines, paving the way for more effective LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Memory-based Ensemble Learning in CMR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09269v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing models typically segment either the entire 3D frame or 2D slices independently to derive clinical functional metrics from ventricular segmentation in cardiac cine sequences. While performing well overall, they struggle at the end slices. To address this, we leverage spatial continuity to extract global uncertainty from segmentation variance and use it as memory in our ensemble learning method, Streaming, for classifier weighting, balancing overall and end-slice performance. Additionally, we introduce the End Coefficient (EC) to quantify end-slice accuracy. Experiments on ACDC and M\&Ms datasets show that our framework achieves near-state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and outperforms all models on end-slice performance, improving patient-specific segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Latents of latents to delineate pixels: hybrid Matryoshka autoencoder-to-U-Net pairing for segmenting large medical images in GPU-poor and low-data regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08988v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical images are often high-resolution and lose important detail if downsampled, making pixel-level methods such as semantic segmentation much less efficient if performed on a low-dimensional image. We propose a low-rank Matryoshka projection and a hybrid segmenting architecture that preserves important information while retaining sufficient pixel geometry for pixel-level tasks. We design the Matryoshka Autoencoder (MatAE-U-Net) which combines the hierarchical encoding of the Matryoshka Autoencoder with the spatial reconstruction capabilities of a U-Net decoder, leveraging multi-scale feature extraction and skip connections to enhance accuracy and generalisation. We apply it to the problem of segmenting the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiographic images using the Stanford EchoNet-D dataset, including 1,000 standardised video-mask pairs of cardiac ultrasound videos resized to 112x112 pixels. The MatAE-UNet model achieves a Mean IoU of 77.68\%, Mean Pixel Accuracy of 97.46\%, and Dice Coefficient of 86.91\%, outperforming the baseline U-Net, which attains a Mean IoU of 74.70\%, Mean Pixel Accuracy of 97.31\%, and Dice Coefficient of 85.20\%. The results highlight the potential of using the U-Net in the recursive Matroshka latent space for imaging problems with low-contrast such as echocardiographic analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Into Spectral Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling waves are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous ``Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' problem -- which highlights how spectral modes encode geometric information -- we introduce a set of convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli. By applying a spectral decomposition to these wave-like activations, we obtain a powerful new representational space that outperforms equivalently local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism and spectral readouts solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, where local feed-forward models fail. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based representations in artificial networks, our findings suggest potential efficiency benefits and offer a new framework for connecting to biological recordings of neural activity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Knowledge Swapping via Learning and Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08075v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce \textbf{Knowledge Swapping}, a novel task designed to selectively regulate knowledge of a pretrained model by enabling the forgetting of user\-specified information, retaining essential knowledge, and acquiring new knowledge simultaneously. By delving into the analysis of knock-on feature hierarchy, we find that incremental learning typically progresses from low\-level representations to higher\-level semantics, whereas forgetting tends to occur in the opposite direction\-starting from high-level semantics and moving down to low-level features. Building upon this, we propose to benchmark the knowledge swapping task with the strategy of \textit{Learning Before Forgetting}. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping}{https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping}.</p></details> | 10 pages | [Code Link](https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping) |
| **[FCN+: Global Receptive Convolution Makes FCN Great Again](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04589v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully convolutional network (FCN) is a seminal work for semantic segmentation. However, due to its limited receptive field, FCN cannot effectively capture global context information which is vital for semantic segmentation. As a result, it is beaten by state-of-the-art methods that leverage different filter sizes for larger receptive fields. However, such a strategy usually introduces more parameters and increases the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel global receptive convolution (GRC) to effectively increase the receptive field of FCN for context information extraction, which results in an improved FCN termed FCN+. The GRC provides the global receptive field for convolution without introducing any extra learnable parameters. The motivation of GRC is that different channels of a convolutional filter can have different grid sampling locations across the whole input feature map. Specifically, the GRC first divides the channels of the filter into two groups. The grid sampling locations of the first group are shifted to different spatial coordinates across the whole feature map, according to their channel indexes. This can help the convolutional filter capture the global context information. The grid sampling location of the second group remains unchanged to keep the original location information. By convolving using these two groups, the GRC can integrate the global context into the original location information of each pixel for better dense prediction results. With the GRC built in, FCN+ can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation tasks, as verified on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and ADE20K. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Zhongying-Deng/FCN_Plus.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeuroComputing</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Zhongying-Deng/FCN_Plus) |
| **[Near, far: Patch-ordering enhances vision foundation models' scene understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11054v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce NeCo: Patch Neighbor Consistency, a novel self-supervised training loss that enforces patch-level nearest neighbor consistency across a student and teacher model. Compared to contrastive approaches that only yield binary learning signals, i.e., 'attract' and 'repel', this approach benefits from the more fine-grained learning signal of sorting spatially dense features relative to reference patches. Our method leverages differentiable sorting applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. This method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establishes several new state-of-the-art results such as +5.5% and +6% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, +7.2% and +5.7% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff and improvements in the 3D understanding of multi-view consistency on SPair-71k, by more than 1.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR25.

| **[LOGCAN++: Adaptive Local-global class-aware network for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16502v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing images usually characterized by complex backgrounds, scale and orientation variations, and large intra-class variance. General semantic segmentation methods usually fail to fully investigate the above issues, and thus their performances on remote sensing image segmentation are limited. In this paper, we propose our LOGCAN++, a semantic segmentation model customized for remote sensing images, which is made up of a Global Class Awareness (GCA) module and several Local Class Awareness (LCA) modules. The GCA module captures global representations for class-level context modeling to reduce the interference of background noise. The LCA module generates local class representations as intermediate perceptual elements to indirectly associate pixels with the global class representations, targeting at dealing with the large intra-class variance problem. In particular, we introduce affine transformations in the LCA module for adaptive extraction of local class representations to effectively tolerate scale and orientation variations in remotely sensed images. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our LOGCAN++ outperforms current mainstream general and remote sensing semantic segmentation methods and achieves a better trade-off between speed and accuracy.

| **[Efficient Continuous Group Convolutions for Local SE(3) Equivariance in 3D Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07505v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending the translation equivariance property of convolutional neural networks to larger symmetry groups has been shown to reduce sample complexity and enable more discriminative feature learning. Further, exploiting additional symmetries facilitates greater weight sharing than standard convolutions, leading to an enhanced network expressivity without an increase in parameter count. However, extending the equivariant properties of a convolution layer comes at a computational cost. In particular, for 3D data, expanding equivariance to the SE(3) group (rotation and translation) results in a 6D convolution operation, which is not tractable for larger data samples such as 3D scene scans. While efforts have been made to develop efficient SE(3) equivariant networks, existing approaches rely on discretization or only introduce global rotation equivariance. This limits their applicability to point clouds representing a scene composed of multiple objects. This work presents an efficient, continuous, and local SE(3) equivariant convolution layer for point cloud processing based on general group convolution and local reference frames. Our experiments show that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of datasets and tasks, including object classification and semantic segmentation, with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching for Visual Misinformation Detection Using Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06288v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8\% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Exploring Few-Shot Defect Segmentation in General Industrial Scenarios with Metric Learning and Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01216v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial defect segmentation is critical for manufacturing quality control. Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode. The contributed dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/liutongkun/GFDS.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/liutongkun/GFDS) |

This study investigated simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposed "Beyond-Labels," a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a handful of image segmentation data to fuse frozen image representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to successfully actualize enormous knowledge from pretrained models without requiring extensive retraining, making the model data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we efficiently captured positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, thus improving the generalization across various image sizes, addressing one of the key limitations of previous methods. Extensive ablation tests were performed to investigate the important components of our proposed method; when tested against the common benchmark PASCAL-5i, it demonstrated superior performance despite being trained on frozen image and language characteristics.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Survey on Mamba Architecture for Vision Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07161v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become foundational for visual tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and video understanding, but their quadratic complexity in attention mechanisms presents scalability challenges. To address these limitations, the Mamba architecture utilizes state-space models (SSMs) for linear scalability, efficient processing, and improved contextual awareness. This paper investigates Mamba architecture for visual domain applications and its recent advancements, including Vision Mamba (ViM) and VideoMamba, which introduce bidirectional scanning, selective scanning mechanisms, and spatiotemporal processing to enhance image and video understanding. Architectural innovations like position embeddings, cross-scan modules, and hierarchical designs further optimize the Mamba framework for global and local feature extraction. These advancements position Mamba as a promising architecture in computer vision research and applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SAMRefiner: Taming Segment Anything Model for Universal Mask Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06756v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore a principal way to enhance the quality of widely pre-existing coarse masks, enabling them to serve as reliable training data for segmentation models to reduce the annotation cost. In contrast to prior refinement techniques that are tailored to specific models or tasks in a close-world manner, we propose SAMRefiner, a universal and efficient approach by adapting SAM to the mask refinement task. The core technique of our model is the noise-tolerant prompting scheme. Specifically, we introduce a multi-prompt excavation strategy to mine diverse input prompts for SAM (i.e., distance-guided points, context-aware elastic bounding boxes, and Gaussian-style masks) from initial coarse masks. These prompts can collaborate with each other to mitigate the effect of defects in coarse masks. In particular, considering the difficulty of SAM to handle the multi-object case in semantic segmentation, we introduce a split-then-merge (STM) pipeline. Additionally, we extend our method to SAMRefiner++ by introducing an additional IoU adaption step to further boost the performance of the generic SAMRefiner on the target dataset. This step is self-boosted and requires no additional annotation. The proposed framework is versatile and can flexibly cooperate with existing segmentation methods. We evaluate our mask framework on a wide range of benchmarks under different settings, demonstrating better accuracy and efficiency. SAMRefiner holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of refinement tools.

Current limitations lead to inaccurate nutritional analysis, inefficient crop management, and suboptimal food processing, impacting food security and public health. Improving segmentation techniques can enhance dietary assessments, agricultural productivity, and the food production process. This study introduces the development of a robust framework for high-quality, near-real-time segmentation and tracking of food items in videos, using minimal hardware resources. We present FoodMem, a novel framework designed to segment food items from video sequences of 360-degree unbounded scenes. FoodMem can consistently generate masks of food portions in a video sequence, overcoming the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models, such as flickering and prohibitive inference speeds in video processing contexts. To address these issues, FoodMem leverages a two-phase solution: a transformer segmentation phase to create initial segmentation masks and a memory-based tracking phase to monitor food masks in complex scenes. Our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art food segmentation models, yielding superior performance across various conditions, such as camera angles, lighting, reflections, scene complexity, and food diversity. This results in reduced segmentation noise, elimination of artifacts, and completion of missing segments. Here, we also introduce a new annotated food dataset encompassing challenging scenarios absent in previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments conducted on MetaFood3D, Nutrition5k, and Vegetables & Fruits datasets demonstrate that FoodMem enhances the state-of-the-art by 2.5% mean average precision in food video segmentation and is 58 x faster on average.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised deep learning for semantic segmentation of multispectral LiDAR forest point clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06227v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point clouds captured with laser scanning systems from forest environments can be utilized in a wide variety of applications within forestry and plant ecology, such as the estimation of tree stem attributes, leaf angle distribution, and above-ground biomass. However, effectively utilizing the data in such tasks requires the semantic segmentation of the data into wood and foliage points, also known as leaf-wood separation. The traditional approach to leaf-wood separation has been geometry- and radiometry-based unsupervised algorithms, which tend to perform poorly on data captured with airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems, even with a high point density. While recent machine and deep learning approaches achieve great results even on sparse point clouds, they require manually labeled training data, which is often extremely laborious to produce. Multispectral (MS) information has been demonstrated to have potential for improving the accuracy of leaf-wood separation, but quantitative assessment of its effects has been lacking. This study proposes a fully unsupervised deep learning method, GrowSP-ForMS, which is specifically designed for leaf-wood separation of high-density MS ALS point clouds and based on the GrowSP architecture. GrowSP-ForMS achieved a mean accuracy of 84.3% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 69.6% on our MS test set, outperforming the unsupervised reference methods by a significant margin. When compared to supervised deep learning methods, our model performed similarly to the slightly older PointNet architecture but was outclassed by more recent approaches. Finally, two ablation studies were conducted, which demonstrated that our proposed changes increased the test set mIoU of GrowSP-ForMS by 29.4 percentage points (pp) in comparison to the original GrowSP model and that utilizing MS data improved the mIoU by 5.6 pp from the monospectral case.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |

Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarize the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages,26 figures,7 tables</p></details> | None |

We introduce LegalSeg, the largest annotated dataset for this task, comprising over 7,000 documents and 1.4 million sentences, labeled with 7 rhetorical roles. To benchmark performance, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models, including Hierarchical BiLSTM-CRF, TransformerOverInLegalBERT (ToInLegalBERT), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Role-Aware Transformers, alongside an exploratory RhetoricLLaMA, an instruction-tuned large language model. Our results demonstrate that models incorporating broader context, structural relationships, and sequential sentence information outperform those relying solely on sentence-level features. Additionally, we conducted experiments using surrounding context and predicted or actual labels of neighboring sentences to assess their impact on classification accuracy. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in distinguishing between closely related roles and addressing class imbalance. Our work underscores the potential of advanced techniques for improving legal document understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in legal NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on NAACL 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Disentangling CLIP Features for Enhanced Localized Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02977v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in coarse-grained tasks like image classification and retrieval. However, they struggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To investigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and identify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated. Specifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes, which we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes evident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated along with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a novel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We introduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them into a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a corresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition (MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This ensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across modalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14 dataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007 and surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training parameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3 methods on COCO and VOC</p></details> |  | None |

The study thoroughly assesses the performance of the U-Net architecture utilizing a large sample of preprocessed satellite topographical images. The model excels in semantic segmentation tasks, displaying high-resolution outputs, quick feature extraction, and flexibility to a wide range of applications. The findings highlight the U-Net architecture's substantial contribution to the advancement of machine learning and image processing technologies. The U-Net approach, which emphasizes pixel-wise categorization and comprehensive segmentation map production, is helpful in practical applications such as autonomous driving, disaster management, and land use planning. This study not only investigates the complexities of U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation, but also highlights its real-world applications in image classification, analysis, and landform identification.

| **[LMS-Net: A Learned Mumford-Shah Network For Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05473v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) methods have shown great promise in handling data-scarce scenarios, particularly in medical image segmentation tasks. However, most existing FSS architectures lack sufficient interpretability and fail to fully incorporate the underlying physical structures of semantic regions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep unfolding network, called the Learned Mumford-Shah Network (LMS-Net), for the FSS task. Specifically, motivated by the effectiveness of pixel-to-prototype comparison in prototypical FSS methods and the capability of deep priors to model complex spatial structures, we leverage our learned Mumford-Shah model (LMS model) as a mathematical foundation to integrate these insights into a unified framework. By reformulating the LMS model into prototype update and mask update tasks, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve it efficiently. Further, the iterative steps of this algorithm are unfolded into corresponding network modules, resulting in LMS-Net with clear interpretability. Comprehensive experiments on three publicly available medical segmentation datasets verify the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness in handling complex structures and adapting to challenging segmentation scenarios.

| **[A Novel Convolutional-Free Method for 3D Medical Imaging Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05396v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation of 3D medical images is a critical task for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated the field, achieving significant success in 3D medical image segmentation. However, CNNs struggle with capturing long-range dependencies and global context, limiting their performance, particularly for fine and complex structures. Recent transformer-based models, such as TransUNet and nnFormer, have demonstrated promise in addressing these limitations, though they still rely on hybrid CNN-transformer architectures. This paper introduces a novel, fully convolutional-free model based on transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach focuses on improving multi-semantic segmentation accuracy and addressing domain adaptation challenges between thick and thin slice CT images. We propose a joint loss function that facilitates effective segmentation of thin slices based on thick slice annotations, overcoming limitations in dataset availability. Furthermore, we present a benchmark dataset for multi-semantic segmentation on thin slices, addressing a gap in current medical imaging research. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over traditional and hybrid architectures, offering new insights into the future of convolution-free medical image segmentation.</p></details> | technical report | None |
| **[IPSeg: Image Posterior Mitigates Semantic Drift in Class-Incremental Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04870v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental learning aims to enable models to learn from sequential, non-stationary data streams across different tasks without catastrophic forgetting. In class incremental semantic segmentation (CISS), the semantic content of image pixels evolves over incremental phases, known as semantic drift. In this work, we identify two critical challenges in CISS that contribute to semantic drift and degrade performance. First, we highlight the issue of separate optimization, where different parts of the model are optimized in distinct incremental stages, leading to misaligned probability scales. Second, we identify noisy semantics arising from inappropriate pseudo-labeling, which results in sub-optimal results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and effective approach, Image Posterior and Semantics Decoupling for Segmentation (IPSeg). IPSeg introduces two key mechanisms: (1) leveraging image posterior probabilities to align optimization across stages and mitigate the effects of separate optimization, and (2) employing semantics decoupling to handle noisy semantics and tailor learning strategies for different semantics. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that IPSeg achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging long-term incremental scenarios.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Exploring scalable medical image encoders beyond text supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10815v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-supervised pre-training has proven to be a valuable method for extracting semantically meaningful features from images, serving as a foundational element in multimodal systems within the computer vision and medical imaging domains. However, the computed features are limited by the information contained in the text, which is particularly problematic in medical imaging, where the findings described by radiologists focus on specific observations. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity of paired imaging-text data due to concerns over leakage of personal health information. In this work, we fundamentally challenge the prevailing reliance on language supervision for learning general-purpose biomedical imaging encoders. We introduce RAD-DINO, a biomedical image encoder pre-trained solely on unimodal biomedical imaging data that obtains similar or greater performance than state-of-the-art biomedical language-supervised models on a diverse range of benchmarks. Specifically, the quality of learned representations is evaluated on standard imaging tasks (classification and semantic segmentation), and a vision-language alignment task (text report generation from images). To further demonstrate the drawback of language supervision, we show that features from RAD-DINO correlate with other medical records (e.g., sex or age) better than language-supervised models, which are generally not mentioned in radiology reports. Finally, we conduct a series of ablations determining the factors in RAD-DINO's performance; notably, we observe that RAD-DINO's downstream performance scales well with the quantity and diversity of training data, demonstrating that image-only supervision is a scalable approach for training a foundational biomedical image encoder. Model weights of RAD-DINO trained on publicly available datasets are available at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/rad-dino.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SeaFormer++: Squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer for Mobile Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13156v6)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the introduction of Vision Transformers, the landscape of many computer vision tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation), which has been overwhelmingly dominated by CNNs, recently has significantly revolutionized. However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification and object detection problems, demonstrating the potential of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone.

| **[Adaptive Margin Contrastive Learning for Ambiguity-aware 3D Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04111v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, namely AMContrast3D. Most existing methods use equally penalized objectives, which ignore per-point ambiguities and less discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we design adaptive objectives for individual points based on their ambiguity levels, aiming to ensure the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes for high-ambiguity points. Specifically, we first estimate ambiguities based on position embeddings. Then, we develop a margin generator to shift decision boundaries for contrastive feature embeddings, so margins are narrowed due to increasing ambiguities with even negative margins for extremely high-ambiguity points. Experimental results on large-scale datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enable open-set semantic segmentation on camera images, potentially aiding automatic labeling. However,VFMs for 3D data have been limited to adaptations of 2D models, which can introduce inconsistencies to 3D labels. This work introduces Label Any Pointcloud (LeAP), leveraging 2D VFMs to automatically label 3D data with any set of classes in any kind of application whilst ensuring label consistency. Using a Bayesian update, point labels are combined into voxels to improve spatio-temporal consistency. A novel 3D Consistency Network (3D-CN) exploits 3D information to further improve label quality. Through various experiments, we show that our method can generate high-quality 3D semantic labels across diverse fields without any manual labeling. Further, models adapted to new domains using our labels show up to a 34.2 mIoU increase in semantic segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Optimized Unet with Attention Mechanism for Multi-Scale Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03813v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is one of the core tasks in the field of computer vision, and its goal is to accurately classify each pixel in an image. The traditional Unet model achieves efficient feature extraction and fusion through an encoder-decoder structure, but it still has certain limitations when dealing with complex backgrounds, long-distance dependencies, and multi-scale targets. To this end, this paper proposes an improved Unet model combined with an attention mechanism, introduces channel attention and spatial attention modules, enhances the model's ability to focus on important features, and optimizes skip connections through a multi-scale feature fusion strategy, thereby improving the combination of global semantic information and fine-grained features. The experiment is based on the Cityscapes dataset and compared with classic models such as FCN, SegNet, DeepLabv3+, and PSPNet. The improved model performs well in terms of mIoU and pixel accuracy (PA), reaching 76.5% and 95.3% respectively. The experimental results verify the superiority of this method in dealing with complex scenes and blurred target boundaries. In addition, this paper discusses the potential of the improved model in practical applications and future expansion directions, indicating that it has broad application value in fields such as autonomous driving, remote sensing image analysis, and medical image processing.</p></details> |  | None |

ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix</p></details> | None |

Existing approaches, often based on simple data augmentation techniques or generative adversarial networks, are limited in producing realistic and varied test cases. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework for testing vision neural networks that leverages Large Language Models and control-conditioned Diffusion Models to generate synthetic, high-fidelity test cases. Our approach begins by translating images into detailed textual descriptions using a captioning model, allowing the language model to identify modifiable aspects of the image and generate counterfactual descriptions. These descriptions are then used to produce new test images through a text-to-image diffusion process that preserves spatial consistency and maintains the critical elements of the scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two datasets: ImageNet1K for image classification and SHIFT for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. The results show that our approach can generate significant test cases that reveal weaknesses and improve the robustness of the model through targeted retraining. We conducted a human assessment using Mechanical Turk to validate the generated images. The responses from the participants confirmed, with high agreement among the voters, that our approach produces valid and realistic images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Ordinality in Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20959v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation consists of predicting a semantic label for each image pixel. While existing deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy, they often overlook the ordinal relationships between classes, which can provide critical domain knowledge (e.g., the pupil lies within the iris, and lane markings are part of the road). This paper introduces novel methods for spatial ordinal segmentation that explicitly incorporate these inter-class dependencies. By treating each pixel as part of a structured image space rather than as an independent observation, we propose two regularization terms and a new metric to enforce ordinal consistency between neighboring pixels. Two loss regularization terms and one metric are proposed for structural ordinal segmentation, which penalizes predictions of non-ordinal adjacent classes. Five biomedical datasets and multiple configurations of autonomous driving datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. Our approach achieves improvements in ordinal metrics and enhances generalization, with up to a 15.7% relative increase in the Dice coefficient. Importantly, these benefits come without additional inference time costs. This work highlights the significance of spatial ordinal relationships in semantic segmentation and provides a foundation for further exploration in structured image representations.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

In CLIP, patch-wise image representations mainly encode the homogeneous image-level properties and thus are not discriminative enough, hindering its application to the dense prediction task. Previous works make image features more distinct across patches, through making each patch mainly attend to itself or the neighboring patches within a narrow local window. However, with their modifications, the ability of CLIP to aggregate global context information, which is known to be useful for distinguishing confusing categories, is largely weakened. In this paper, we propose a new method named GCLIP, which mines the beneficial global knowledge of CLIP to facilitate the TF-OVSS task. Firstly, we aim to equip the last-block attention with image-level properties while not introducing homogeneous attention patterns across patches. In GCLIP, we merge the attention from the global token emerging blocks with the Query-Query attention to realize this goal. Secondly, we aim to make the Value embeddings of the last-block attention module more distinct and semantically correlated. To realize this, we design a novel channel suppression strategy. As the representation of each patch is finally determined by the attention weights and the Value embeddings, our method can generate more discriminative patch-level image features while absorbing global context information. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Muographic Image Upsampling with Machine Learning for Built Infrastructure Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02624v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The civil engineering industry faces a critical need for innovative non-destructive evaluation methods, particularly for ageing critical infrastructure, such as bridges, where current techniques fall short. Muography, a non-invasive imaging technique, constructs three-dimensional density maps by detecting interactions of naturally occurring cosmic-ray muons within the scanned volume. Cosmic-ray muons provide deep penetration and inherent safety due to their high momenta and natural source. However, the technology's reliance on this source results in constrained muon flux, leading to prolonged acquisition times, noisy reconstructions and image interpretation challenges. To address these limitations, we developed a two-model deep learning approach. First, we employed a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP) to perform predictive upsampling of undersampled muography images. Using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), 1-day sampled images matched the perceptual qualities of a 21-day image, while the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) indicated noise improvement equivalent to 31 days of sampling. A second cWGAN-GP model, trained for semantic segmentation, quantitatively assessed the upsampling model's impact on concrete sample features. This model achieved segmentation of rebar grids and tendon ducts, with Dice-S{\o}rensen accuracy coefficients of 0.8174 and 0.8663. Notably, it could mitigate or remove z-plane smearing artifacts caused by muography's inverse imaging problem. Both models were trained on a comprehensive Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulation dataset reflecting realistic civil infrastructure scenarios. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in acquisition speed and image quality, marking a substantial step toward making muography more practical for reinforced concrete infrastructure monitoring applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods for reducing negative transfer focus on classification or regression tasks, ignoring the non-uniform negative transfer risk in different image regions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective weighted fine-tuning method that directs the model's attention towards regions with significant transfer risk for medical semantic segmentation. Specifically, we compute a transferability-guided transfer risk map to quantify the transfer hardness for each pixel and the potential risks of negative transfer. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a map-weighted loss function, normalized with image foreground size to counter class imbalance. Extensive experiments on brain segmentation datasets show our method significantly improves the target task performance, with gains of 4.37% on FeTS2021 and 1.81% on iSeg2019, avoiding negative transfer across modalities and tasks. Meanwhile, a 2.9% gain under a few-shot scenario validates the robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UNIP: Rethinking Pre-trained Attention Patterns for Infrared Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02257v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training techniques significantly enhance the performance of semantic segmentation tasks with limited training data. However, the efficacy under a large domain gap between pre-training (e.g. RGB) and fine-tuning (e.g. infrared) remains underexplored. In this study, we first benchmark the infrared semantic segmentation performance of various pre-training methods and reveal several phenomena distinct from the RGB domain. Next, our layerwise analysis of pre-trained attention maps uncovers that: (1) There are three typical attention patterns (local, hybrid, and global); (2) Pre-training tasks notably influence the pattern distribution across layers; (3) The hybrid pattern is crucial for semantic segmentation as it attends to both nearby and foreground elements; (4) The texture bias impedes model generalization in infrared tasks. Building on these insights, we propose UNIP, a UNified Infrared Pre-training framework, to enhance the pre-trained model performance. This framework uses the hybrid-attention distillation NMI-HAD as the pre-training target, a large-scale mixed dataset InfMix for pre-training, and a last-layer feature pyramid network LL-FPN for fine-tuning. Experimental results show that UNIP outperforms various pre-training methods by up to 13.5\% in average mIoU on three infrared segmentation tasks, evaluated using fine-tuning and linear probing metrics. UNIP-S achieves performance on par with MAE-L while requiring only 1/10 of the computational cost. Furthermore, UNIP significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) infrared or RGB segmentation methods and demonstrates broad potential for application in other modalities, such as RGB and depth.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, this challenge is magnified by overburdened medical systems and limited access to advanced imaging modalities and expert radiologists. Automating brain tumor segmentation using deep learning offers a promising solution. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially the U-Net architecture, have shown significant potential. However, a major challenge remains: achieving generalizability across different datasets. This study addresses this gap by developing a deep learning ensemble that integrates UNet3D, V-Net, and MSA-VNet models for the semantic segmentation of gliomas. By initially training on the BraTS-GLI dataset and fine-tuning with the BraTS-SSA dataset, we enhance model performance. Our ensemble approach significantly outperforms individual models, achieving DICE scores of 0.8358 for Tumor Core, 0.8521 for Whole Tumor, and 0.8167 for Enhancing Tumor. These results underscore the potential of ensemble methods in improving the accuracy and reliability of automated brain tumor segmentation, particularly in resource-limited settings.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate that META exhibits superior generalization capability and stronger adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Current approaches primarily focus on acquiring informative fusion images at the visual display stratum through intricate mappings. Although some approaches attempt to jointly optimize image fusion and downstream tasks, these efforts often lack direct guidance or interaction, serving only to assist with a predefined fusion loss. To address this, we propose an ``Unfolding Attribution Analysis Fusion network'' (UAAFusion), using attribution analysis to tailor fused images more effectively for semantic segmentation, enhancing the interaction between the fusion and segmentation. Specifically, we utilize attribution analysis techniques to explore the contributions of semantic regions in the source images to task discrimination. At the same time, our fusion algorithm incorporates more beneficial features from the source images, thereby allowing the segmentation to guide the fusion process. Our method constructs a model-driven unfolding network that uses optimization objectives derived from attribution analysis, with an attribution fusion loss calculated from the current state of the segmentation network. We also develop a new pathway function for attribution analysis, specifically tailored to the fusion tasks in our unfolding network. An attribution attention mechanism is integrated at each network stage, allowing the fusion network to prioritize areas and pixels crucial for high-level recognition tasks. Additionally, to mitigate the information loss in traditional unfolding networks, a memory augmentation module is incorporated into our network to improve the information flow across various network layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in image fusion and applicability to semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT) 2024</p></details> | None |

Unfortunately, the segmentation masks obtained in the WS regime are typically poor in terms of accuracy. In this work, we present a WS method capable of producing accurate masks for semantic segmentation in the case of video streams. More specifically, we build saliency maps that exploit the temporal coherence between consecutive frames in a video, promoting consistency when objects appear in different frames. We apply our method in a waste-sorting scenario, where we perform weakly supervised video segmentation (WSVS) by training an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes between videos recorded before and after a human operator, who manually removes specific wastes from a conveyor belt. The saliency maps of this classifier identify materials to be removed, and we modify the classifier training to minimize differences between the saliency map of a central frame and those in adjacent frames, after having compensated object displacement. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the benefits of integrating temporal coherence directly during the training phase of the classifier.

The ability to identify such concepts and their characteristics without supervision has the potential to improve pre-training methods, and enable novel applications such as fine-grained image retrieval and concept-based outlier detection. In this paper, we introduce ConceptVAE, a novel pre-training framework that detects and disentangles fine-grained concepts from their style characteristics in a self-supervised manner. We present a suite of loss terms and model architecture primitives designed to discretise input data into a preset number of concepts along with their local style. We validate ConceptVAE both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its ability to detect fine-grained anatomical structures such as blood pools and septum walls from 2D cardiac echocardiographies. Quantitatively, ConceptVAE outperforms traditional self-supervised methods in tasks such as region-based instance retrieval, semantic segmentation, out-of-distribution detection, and object detection. Additionally, we explore the generation of in-distribution synthetic data that maintains the same concepts as the training data but with distinct styles, highlighting its potential for more calibrated data generation. Overall, our study introduces and validates a promising new pre-training technique based on concept-style disentanglement, opening multiple avenues for developing models for medical image analysis that are more interpretable and explainable than black-box approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite advancements in attack methods for semantic segmentation, transferability remains limited, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce the Feature Similarity Projected Gradient Descent (FSPGD) attack, a novel black-box approach that enhances both attack performance and transferability. Unlike conventional segmentation attacks that rely on output predictions for gradient calculation, FSPGD computes gradients from intermediate layer features. Specifically, our method introduces a loss function that targets local information by comparing features between clean images and adversarial examples, while also disrupting contextual information by accounting for spatial relationships between objects. Experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that FSPGD achieves superior transferability and attack performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark.

To effectively deploy these models in real-world scenarios, it is essential to employ cross-domain adaptation techniques that bridge the gap between training data and real-world data. Recently, self-training with pseudo-labels has emerged as a predominant method for cross-domain adaptation in multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation. However, generating reliable pseudo-labels necessitates stringent constraints, which often result in sparse pseudo-labels after pruning. This sparsity can potentially hinder performance improvement during the adaptation process. We propose an image-guided pseudo-label enhancement approach that leverages the complementary 2D prior knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to introduce more reliable pseudo-labels, thereby boosting domain adaptation performance. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and the SAM masks from its paired image data, we collect all 3D points covered by each SAM mask that potentially belong to the same object. Then our method refines the pseudo-labels within each SAM mask in two steps. First, we determine the class label for each mask using majority voting and employ various constraints to filter out unreliable mask labels. Next, we introduce Geometry-Aware Progressive Propagation (GAPP) which propagates the mask label to all 3D points within the SAM mask while avoiding outliers caused by 2D-3D misalignment. Experiments conducted across multiple datasets and domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our proposed method significantly increases the quantity of high-quality pseudo-labels and enhances the adaptation performance over baseline methods.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 | None |
| **[A hierarchical semantic segmentation framework for computer vision-based bridge damage detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08878v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision-based damage detection using remote cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables efficient and low-cost bridge health monitoring that reduces labor costs and the needs for sensor installation and maintenance. By leveraging recent semantic image segmentation approaches, we are able to find regions of critical structural components and recognize damage at the pixel level using images as the only input. However, existing methods perform poorly when detecting small damages (e.g., cracks and exposed rebars) and thin objects with limited image samples, especially when the components of interest are highly imbalanced. To this end, this paper introduces a semantic segmentation framework that imposes the hierarchical semantic relationship between component category and damage types. For example, certain concrete cracks only present on bridge columns and therefore the non-column region will be masked out when detecting such damages. In this way, the damage detection model could focus on learning features from possible damaged regions only and avoid the effects of other irrelevant regions. We also utilize multi-scale augmentation that provides views with different scales that preserves contextual information of each image without losing the ability of handling small and thin objects. Furthermore, the proposed framework employs important sampling that repeatedly samples images containing rare components (e.g., railway sleeper and exposed rebars) to provide more data samples, which addresses the imbalanced data challenge.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Complex Wavelet Mutual Information Loss: A Multi-Scale Loss Function for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00563v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep neural networks have significantly enhanced the performance of semantic segmentation. However, class imbalance and instance imbalance remain persistent challenges, where smaller instances and thin boundaries are often overshadowed by larger structures. To address the multiscale nature of segmented objects, various models have incorporated mechanisms such as spatial attention and feature pyramid networks. Despite these advancements, most loss functions are still primarily pixel-wise, while regional and boundary-focused loss functions often incur high computational costs or are restricted to small-scale regions. To address this limitation, we propose complex wavelet mutual information (CWMI) loss, a novel loss function that leverages mutual information from subband images decomposed by a complex steerable pyramid. The complex steerable pyramid captures features across multiple orientations and preserves structural similarity across scales. Meanwhile, mutual information is well-suited for capturing high-dimensional directional features and exhibits greater noise robustness. Extensive experiments on diverse segmentation datasets demonstrate that CWMI loss achieves significant improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy and topological metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, while introducing minimal computational overhead.

Addressing this, our study extends into semi-supervised learning for LiDAR semantic segmentation, leveraging the intrinsic spatial priors of driving scenes and multi-sensor complements to augment the efficacy of unlabeled datasets. We introduce LaserMix++, an evolved framework that integrates laser beam manipulations from disparate LiDAR scans and incorporates LiDAR-camera correspondences to further assist data-efficient learning. Our framework is tailored to enhance 3D scene consistency regularization by incorporating multi-modality, including 1) multi-modal LaserMix operation for fine-grained cross-sensor interactions; 2) camera-to-LiDAR feature distillation that enhances LiDAR feature learning; and 3) language-driven knowledge guidance generating auxiliary supervisions using open-vocabulary models. The versatility of LaserMix++ enables applications across LiDAR representations, establishing it as a universally applicable solution. Our framework is rigorously validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on popular driving perception datasets. Results demonstrate that LaserMix++ markedly outperforms fully supervised alternatives, achieving comparable accuracy with five times fewer annotations and significantly improving the supervised-only baselines. This substantial advancement underscores the potential of semi-supervised approaches in reducing the reliance on extensive labeled data in LiDAR-based 3D scene understanding systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>TPAMI...</summary><p>TPAMI 2025; 18 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables; Code at https://github.com/ldkong1205/LaserMix</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ldkong1205/LaserMix) |

Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. We further introduce a novel approach to evaluate individually segmented 3D assets from 3D radiance field segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[Medical Semantic Segmentation with Diffusion Pretrain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19265v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have shown that learning robust feature representations is critical for the success of many computer vision tasks, including medical image segmentation. In particular, both transformer and convolutional-based architectures have benefit from leveraging pretext tasks for pretraining. However, the adoption of pretext tasks in 3D medical imaging has been less explored and remains a challenge, especially in the context of learning generalizable feature representations. We propose a novel pretraining strategy using diffusion models with anatomical guidance, tailored to the intricacies of 3D medical image data. We introduce an auxiliary diffusion process to pretrain a model that produce generalizable feature representations, useful for a variety of downstream segmentation tasks. We employ an additional model that predicts 3D universal body-part coordinates, providing guidance during the diffusion process and improving spatial awareness in generated representations. This approach not only aids in resolving localization inaccuracies but also enriches the model's ability to understand complex anatomical structures. Empirical validation on a 13-class organ segmentation task demonstrate the effectiveness of our pretraining technique. It surpasses existing restorative pretraining methods in 3D medical image segmentation by $7.5\%$, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art contrastive pretraining approach, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 67.8 in a non-linear evaluation scenario.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[$α$-OCC: Uncertainty-Aware Camera-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11021v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of autonomous vehicle perception, comprehending 3D scenes is paramount for tasks such as planning and mapping. Camera-based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction (OCC) aims to infer scene geometry and semantics from limited observations. While it has gained popularity due to affordability and rich visual cues, existing methods often neglect the inherent uncertainty in models. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware OCC method ($\alpha$-OCC). We first introduce Depth-UP, an uncertainty propagation framework that improves geometry completion by up to 11.58\% and semantic segmentation by up to 12.95\% across various OCC models. For uncertainty quantification (UQ), we propose the hierarchical conformal prediction (HCP) method, effectively handling the high-level class imbalance in OCC datasets. On the geometry level, the novel KL-based score function significantly improves the occupied recall (45\%) of safety-critical classes with minimal performance overhead (3.4\% reduction). On UQ, our HCP achieves smaller prediction set sizes while maintaining the defined coverage guarantee. Compared with baselines, it reduces up to 92\% set size, with 18\% further reduction when integrated with Depth-UP. Our contributions advance OCC accuracy and robustness, marking a noteworthy step forward in autonomous perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ContextFormer: Redefining Efficiency in Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19255v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation assigns labels to pixels in images, a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Convolutional methods, although capturing local dependencies well, struggle with long-range relationships. Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in global context capture but are hindered by high computational demands, especially for high-resolution inputs. Most research optimizes the encoder architecture, leaving the bottleneck underexplored - a key area for enhancing performance and efficiency. We propose ContextFormer, a hybrid framework leveraging the strengths of CNNs and ViTs in the bottleneck to balance efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for real-time semantic segmentation. The framework's efficiency is driven by three synergistic modules: the Token Pyramid Extraction Module (TPEM) for hierarchical multi-scale representation, the Transformer and Modulating DepthwiseConv (Trans-MDC) block for dynamic scale-aware feature modeling, and the Feature Merging Module (FMM) for robust integration with enhanced spatial and contextual consistency. Extensive experiments on ADE20K, Pascal Context, CityScapes, and COCO-Stuff datasets show ContextFormer significantly outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art mIoU scores, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and performance. The codes will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we present CerraData-4MM, a multimodal dataset combining Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imagery (MSI) with 10m spatial resolution. The dataset includes two hierarchical classification levels with 7 and 14 classes, respectively, focusing on the diverse Bico do Papagaio ecoregion. We highlight CerraData-4MM's capacity to benchmark advanced semantic segmentation techniques by evaluating a standard U-Net and a more sophisticated Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The ViT achieves superior performance in multimodal scenarios, with the highest macro F1-score of 57.60% and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 49.05% at the first hierarchical level. Both models struggle with minority classes, particularly at the second hierarchical level, where U-Net's performance drops to an F1-score of 18.16%. Class balancing improves representation for underrepresented classes but reduces overall accuracy, underscoring the trade-off in weighted training. CerraData-4MM offers a challenging benchmark for advancing deep learning models to handle class imbalance and multimodal data fusion.

Our proposed approach effectively leverages both the labelled data selected through active learning and the unlabelled data excluded from the selection process. The proposed active learning approach pinpoints areas where the pseudo-labels are likely to be inaccurate. Then, an automatic and efficient pseudo-label auto-refinement (PLAR) module is proposed to correct pixels with potentially erroneous pseudo-labels by comparing their feature representations with those of labelled regions. This approach operates without increasing the labelling budget and is based on the cluster assumption, which states that pixels belonging to the same class should exhibit similar representations in feature space. Furthermore, manual labelling is only applied to the most difficult and uncertain areas in unlabelled data, where insufficient information prevents the PLAR module from making a decision. We evaluated the proposed hybrid semi-supervised active learning framework on two benchmark datasets, one from natural and the other from remote sensing imagery domains. In both cases, it outperformed state-of-the-art methods in the semantic segmentation task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, collecting and labeling real LiDAR data is an expensive and time-consuming task. While datasets such as SemanticKITTI have been manually collected and labeled, the introduction of simulation tools such as CARLA, has enabled the creation of synthetic datasets on demand. In this work, we present a modified CARLA simulator designed with LiDAR semantic segmentation in mind, with new classes, more consistent object labeling with their counterparts from real datasets such as SemanticKITTI, and the possibility to adjust the object class distribution. Using this tool, we have generated SynthmanticLiDAR, a synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation on LiDAR imaging, designed to be similar to SemanticKITTI, and we evaluate its contribution to the training process of different semantic segmentation algorithms by using a naive transfer learning approach. Our results show that incorporating SynthmanticLiDAR into the training process improves the overall performance of tested algorithms, proving the usefulness of our dataset, and therefore, our adapted CARLA simulator.

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional manual health check, using Electroluminescence (EL) imaging, is expensive and logistically challenging which makes automated defect detection essential. Current automation approaches require extensive manual expert labeling, which is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. We propose PV-S3 (Photovoltaic-Semi Supervised Segmentation), a Semi-Supervised Learning approach for semantic segmentation of defects in EL images that reduces reliance on extensive labeling. PV-S3 is a Deep learning model trained using a few labeled images along with numerous unlabeled images. We introduce a novel Semi Cross-Entropy loss function to deal with class imbalance. We evaluate PV-S3 on multiple datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability. With merely 20% labeled samples, we achieve an absolute improvement of 9.7% in IoU, 13.5% in Precision, 29.15% in Recall, and 20.42% in F1-Score over prior state-of-the-art supervised method (which uses 100% labeled samples) on UCF-EL dataset (largest dataset available for semantic segmentation of EL images) showing improvement in performance while reducing the annotation costs by 80%.

In dense outdoor point clouds, the receptive field of a machine learning model may be too small to accurately determine the surroundings and context of a point. By computing Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) from the point clouds, we extract the relative elevation feature, which is the vertical distance from the terrain to a point. RandLA-Net is employed for efficient semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds. We assess its performance across three diverse outdoor datasets captured with varying sensor technologies and sensor locations. Integration of relative elevation data leads to consistent performance improvements across all three datasets, most notably in the Hessigheim dataset, with an increase of 3.7 percentage points in average F1 score from 72.35% to 76.01%, by establishing long-range dependencies between ground and objects. We also explore additional local features such as planarity, normal vectors, and 2D features, but their efficacy varied based on the characteristics of the point cloud. Ultimately, this study underscores the important role of the non-local relative elevation feature for semantic segmentation of point clouds in remote sensing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the GRAPP 2025 conference</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements in large-scale vision-language models have demonstrated their open-vocabulary understanding capabilities, significantly facilitating the development of OVSS. However, most existing methods suffer from either suboptimal performance or long latency. This study introduces ERR-Seg, a novel framework that effectively reduces redundancy to balance accuracy and efficiency. ERR-Seg incorporates a training-free Channel Reduction Module (CRM) that leverages prior knowledge from vision-language models like CLIP to identify the most relevant classes while discarding others. Moreover, it incorporates Efficient Semantic Context Fusion (ESCF) with spatial-level and class-level sequence reduction strategies. CRM and ESCF result in substantial memory and computational savings without compromising accuracy. Additionally, recognizing the significance of hierarchical semantics extracted from middle-layer features for closed-set semantic segmentation, ERR-Seg introduces the Hierarchical Semantic Module (HSM) to exploit hierarchical semantics in the context of OVSS. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods under the ADE20K-847 setting, ERR-Seg achieves +$5.6\%$ mIoU improvement and reduces latency by $67.3\%$.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing datasets of labeled indoor point clouds have been acquired by photogrammetry. In contrast, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) can acquire dense sub-centimeter point clouds and has become the standard for surveyors. We present 3DSES (3D Segmentation of ESGT point clouds), a new dataset of indoor dense TLS colorized point clouds covering 427 m 2 of an engineering school. 3DSES has a unique double annotation format: semantic labels annotated at the point level alongside a full 3D CAD model of the building. We introduce a model-to-cloud algorithm for automated labeling of indoor point clouds using an existing 3D CAD model. 3DSES has 3 variants of various semantic and geometrical complexities. We show that our model-to-cloud alignment can produce pseudo-labels on our point clouds with a \&gt; 95% accuracy, allowing us to train deep models with significant time savings compared to manual labeling. First baselines on 3DSES show the difficulties encountered by existing models when segmenting objects relevant to BIM, such as light and safety utilities.

As a classical downstream task, zero-shot semantic segmentation has been studied because of its applicant value. One of the popular zero-shot semantic segmentation methods is based on the generative model Most new proposed works added structures on the same architecture to enhance this model. However, we found that, from the view of causal inference, the result of the original model has been influenced by spurious statistical relationships. Thus the performance of the prediction shows severe bias. In this work, we consider counterfactual methods to avoid the confounder in the original model. Based on this method, we proposed a new framework for zero-shot semantic segmentation. Our model is compared with baseline models on two real-world datasets, Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context.

| **[AdaSemSeg: An Adaptive Few-shot Semantic Segmentation of Seismic Facies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16760v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated interpretation of seismic images using deep learning methods is challenging because of the limited availability of training data. Few-shot learning is a suitable learning paradigm in such scenarios due to its ability to adapt to a new task with limited supervision (small training budget). Existing few-shot semantic segmentation (FSSS) methods fix the number of target classes. Therefore, they do not support joint training on multiple datasets varying in the number of classes. In the context of the interpretation of seismic facies, fixing the number of target classes inhibits the generalization capability of a model trained on one facies dataset to another, which is likely to have a different number of facies. To address this shortcoming, we propose a few-shot semantic segmentation method for interpreting seismic facies that can adapt to the varying number of facies across the dataset, dubbed the AdaSemSeg. In general, the backbone network of FSSS methods is initialized with the statistics learned from the ImageNet dataset for better performance. The lack of such a huge annotated dataset for seismic images motivates using a self-supervised algorithm on seismic datasets to initialize the backbone network. We have trained the AdaSemSeg on three public seismic facies datasets with different numbers of facies and evaluated the proposed method on multiple metrics. The performance of the AdaSemSeg on unseen datasets (not used in training) is better than the prototype-based few-shot method and baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods often rely on outlier exclusions or semantic segmentations, which suffer from low computational efficiency and accuracy. The proposed SSF-PAN can achieve the functionalities of LiDAR point cloud based object detection/localization and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) with high computational efficiency and accuracy, enabling map-free navigation frameworks. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a neural network which can achieve segmentation among static and dynamic objects within the scene flows with different motion features, that is, semantic scene flow (SSF); 2) developing an iterative framework which can further optimize the quality of input scene flows and output segmentation results; 3) developing a scene flow-based navigation platform which can test the performance of the SSF perception system in the simulation environment. The proposed SSF-PAN method is validated using the SUScape-CARLA and the KITTI datasets, as well as on the CARLA simulator.

While traditional segmentation methods have achieved remarkable success, their generalization to diverse scenes and unseen object categories remains limited. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for bridging visual and textual modalities, providing a deeper understanding of semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose LangSeg, a novel LLM-guided semantic segmentation method that leverages context-sensitive, fine-grained subclass descriptors generated by LLMs. Our framework integrates these descriptors with a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to achieve superior segmentation performance without extensive model retraining. We evaluate LangSeg on two challenging datasets, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to a 6.1% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study and human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that LangSeg not only excels in semantic understanding and contextual alignment but also provides a flexible and efficient framework for language-guided segmentation tasks. This approach opens up new possibilities for interactive and domain-specific segmentation applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DynAlign: Unsupervised Dynamic Taxonomy Alignment for Cross-Domain Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16410v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods for semantic segmentation typically assume identical class labels between the source and target domains. This assumption ignores the label-level domain gap, which is common in real-world scenarios, thus limiting their ability to identify finer-grained or novel categories without requiring extensive manual annotation. A promising direction to address this limitation lies in recent advancements in foundation models, which exhibit strong generalization abilities due to their rich prior knowledge. However, these models often struggle with domain-specific nuances and underrepresented fine-grained categories. To address these challenges, we introduce DynAlign, a framework that integrates UDA with foundation models to bridge both the image-level and label-level domain gaps. Our approach leverages prior semantic knowledge to align source categories with target categories that can be novel, more fine-grained, or named differently (e.g., vehicle to {car, truck, bus}). Foundation models are then employed for precise segmentation and category reassignment. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a knowledge fusion approach that dynamically adapts to varying scene contexts. DynAlign generates accurate predictions in a new target label space without requiring any manual annotations, allowing seamless adaptation to new taxonomies through either model retraining or direct inference. Experiments on the street scene semantic segmentation benchmarks GTA to Mapillary Vistas and GTA to IDD validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a significant improvement over existing methods.

We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both global interactions and local representations while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further pre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution 384$^2$. For downstream tasks, L$^2$ViT delivers favorable performance as a backbone on object detection as well as semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing sensor fusion methods often treat sensors uniformly across all conditions, leading to suboptimal performance. By contrast, we propose a novel, condition-aware multimodal fusion approach for robust semantic perception of driving scenes. Our method, CAFuser, uses an RGB camera input to classify environmental conditions and generate a Condition Token that guides the fusion of multiple sensor modalities. We further newly introduce modality-specific feature adapters to align diverse sensor inputs into a shared latent space, enabling efficient integration with a single and shared pre-trained backbone. By dynamically adapting sensor fusion based on the actual condition, our model significantly improves robustness and accuracy, especially in adverse-condition scenarios. CAFuser ranks first on the public MUSES benchmarks, achieving 59.7 PQ for multimodal panoptic and 78.2 mIoU for semantic segmentation, and also sets the new state of the art on DeLiVER.

Our method D-PLS first performs single-scan semantic segmentation and aggregates the results over time, using them to guide instance segmentation. The modular design of D-PLS allows for seamless integration on top of any semantic segmentation architecture, without requiring architectural changes or retraining. We evaluate our approach on the SemanticKITTI dataset, where it demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline in both classification and association tasks, as measured by the LiDAR Segmentation and Tracking Quality (LSTQ) metric. Furthermore, we show that our decoupled architecture not only enhances instance prediction but also surpasses the baseline due to advancements in single-scan semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Datasets and methods have appeared and expanded very quickly, but methods have not been updated to exploit this new data availability and rely on the same classical datasets. Different ways of performing LIDAR semantic segmentation training and inference can be divided into several subfields, which include the following: domain generalization, source-to-source segmentation, and pre-training. In this work, we aim to improve results in all of these subfields with the novel approach of multi-source training. Multi-source training relies on the availability of various datasets at training time. To overcome the common obstacles in multi-source training, we introduce the coarse labels and call the newly created multi-source dataset COLA. We propose three applications of this new dataset that display systematic improvement over single-source strategies: COLA-DG for domain generalization (+10%), COLA-S2S for source-to-source segmentation (+5.3%), and COLA-PT for pre-training (+12%). We demonstrate that multi-source approaches bring systematic improvement over single-source approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

The local interactions are derived from transforming a standard convolutional network, \textit{i.e.}, ConvNeXt, to design a more lightweight mobile network. Our newly introduced mobile modulation attention removes memory-intensive operations in MHA and employs an efficient modulation mechanism to boost dynamic global representational capacity. We conduct comprehensive experiments demonstrating that iFormer outperforms existing lightweight networks across various tasks. Notably, iFormer achieves an impressive Top-1 accuracy of 80.4\% on ImageNet-1k with a latency of only 1.10 ms on an iPhone 13, surpassing the recently proposed MobileNetV4 under similar latency constraints. Additionally, our method shows significant improvements in downstream tasks, including COCO object detection, instance segmentation, and ADE20k semantic segmentation, while still maintaining low latency on mobile devices for high-resolution inputs in these scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Most previous methods focused on producing large-scale synthetic image-annotation samples and then training the segmenter with all of them. However, such a solution remains a main challenge in that the poor-quality samples are unavoidable, and using them to train the model will damage the training process. In this paper, we propose a training-free Synthetic Data Selection (SDS) strategy with CLIP to select high-quality samples for building a reliable synthetic dataset. Specifically, given massive synthetic image-annotation pairs, we first design a Perturbation-based CLIP Similarity (PCS) to measure the reliability of synthetic image, thus removing samples with low-quality images. Then we propose a class-balance Annotation Similarity Filter (ASF) by comparing the synthetic annotation with the response of CLIP to remove the samples related to low-quality annotations. The experimental results show that using our method significantly reduces the data size by half, while the trained segmenter achieves higher performance.

However, their potential in guiding synthesis tasks, particularly cross-view image synthesis, remains underexplored. Cross-view image synthesis presents significant challenges in establishing reliable correspondences between drastically different viewpoints. To address this, we propose a novel retrieval-guided framework that reimagines how retrieval techniques can facilitate effective cross-view image synthesis. Unlike existing methods that rely on auxiliary information, such as semantic segmentation maps or preprocessing modules, our retrieval-guided framework captures semantic similarities across different viewpoints, trained through contrastive learning to create a smooth embedding space. Furthermore, a novel fusion mechanism leverages these embeddings to guide image synthesis while learning and encoding both view-invariant and view-specific features. To further advance this area, we introduce VIGOR-GEN, a new urban-focused dataset with complex viewpoint variations in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our retrieval-guided approach significantly outperforms existing methods on the CVUSA, CVACT and VIGOR-GEN datasets, particularly in retrieval accuracy (R@1) and synthesis quality (FID). Our work bridges information retrieval and synthesis tasks, offering insights into how retrieval techniques can address complex cross-domain synthesis challenges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Test-time Contrastive Concepts for Open-world Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05061v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent CLIP-like Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs to align both modalities with a simple contrastive objective, have paved the way to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image, which contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic $\textit{background}$ text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, textual contrastive concepts that are query-specific. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach to commonly used datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach builds on Neural Turing Machines and Token Turing Machines, which were applied to NLP and sequential visual understanding tasks. ViTTMs are designed for non-sequential computer vision tasks such as image classification and segmentation. Our model creates two sets of tokens: process tokens and memory tokens; process tokens pass through encoder blocks and read-write from memory tokens at each encoder block in the network, allowing them to store and retrieve information from memory. By ensuring that there are fewer process tokens than memory tokens, we are able to reduce the inference time of the network while maintaining its accuracy. On ImageNet-1K, the state-of-the-art ViT-B has median latency of 529.5ms and 81.0% accuracy, while our ViTTM-B is 56% faster (234.1ms), with 2.4 times fewer FLOPs, with an accuracy of 82.9%. On ADE20K semantic segmentation, ViT-B achieves 45.65mIoU at 13.8 frame-per-second (FPS) whereas our ViTTM-B model acheives a 45.17 mIoU with 26.8 FPS (+94%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

This is particularly important for models that need to be robust or are costly to train. LiDAR perception in autonomous driving is impacted by both of these concerns, leading to the emergence of various approaches. This work addresses the challenge by proposing a geometry-based approach, leveraging the sequential structure of LiDAR sensors, which sets it apart from the learning-based methods commonly found in the literature. The proposed method, called 3DLabelProp, is applied on the task of LiDAR Semantic Segmentation (LSS). Through extensive experimentation on seven datasets, it is demonstrated to be a state-of-the-art approach, outperforming both naive and other domain generalization methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, real-world applications such as autonomous driving face challenges with imbalanced object class and size distributions and complex scene geometries. In this paper, we propose S3PT a novel scene semantics and structure guided clustering to provide more scene-consistent objectives for self-supervised training. Specifically, our contributions are threefold: First, we incorporate semantic distribution consistent clustering to encourage better representation of rare classes such as motorcycles or animals. Second, we introduce object diversity consistent spatial clustering, to handle imbalanced and diverse object sizes, ranging from large background areas to small objects such as pedestrians and traffic signs. Third, we propose a depth-guided spatial clustering to regularize learning based on geometric information of the scene, thus further refining region separation on the feature level. Our learned representations significantly improve performance in downstream semantic segmentation and 3D object detection tasks on the nuScenes, nuImages, and Cityscapes datasets and show promising domain translation properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for WACV 2025 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

The purpose of these photos is to spur development in robotics, AI-based perception, and autonomous navigation. Acknowledging a scarcity of lunar images from around the lunar poles, NASA Ames produced on Earth but in controlled conditions images that resemble rover operating conditions from these regions of the Moon. We report on the outcomes of an effort aimed at accomplishing two tasks. In Task 1, we provided bounding boxes and semantic segmentation information for all the images in NASA's POLAR dataset. This effort resulted in 23,000 labels and semantic segmentation annotations pertaining to rocks, shadows, and craters. In Task 2, we generated the digital twins of the 13 scenarios that have been used to produce all the photos in the POLAR dataset. Specifically, for each of these scenarios, we produced individual meshes, texture information, and material properties associated with the ground and the rocks in each scenario. This allows anyone with a camera model to synthesize images associated with any of the 13 scenarios of the POLAR dataset. Effectively, one can generate as many semantically labeled synthetic images as desired -- with different locations and exposure values in the scene, for different positions of the sun, with or without the presence of active illumination, etc. The benefit of this work is twofold. Using outcomes of Task 1, one can train and/or test perception algorithms that deal with Moon images. For Task 2, one can produce as much data as desired to train and test AI algorithms that are anticipated to work in lunar conditions. All the outcomes of this work are available in a public repository for unfettered use and distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have demonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising questions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose applicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit capabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image editing, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current evaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models' performance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we developed the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0, Midjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng. Our evaluation is divided into five key domains: structured output generation, realism, and physical consistency, specific domain generation, challenging scenario generation, and multi-style creation tasks. This comprehensive assessment highlights each model's strengths and limitations, particularly the outstanding performance of FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0 in structured and specific domain tasks, underscoring the expanding applications and potential of T2I models as foundational AI tools.

To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.</p></details> |  | None |

Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> | None |

By utilizing multi-temporal ALS point clouds, semantic changes in urban area can be captured, demonstrating significant potential in urban planning, emergency management, and infrastructure maintenance. Existing 3D change detection methods struggle to efficiently extract multi-class semantic information and change features, still facing the following challenges: (1) the difficulty of accurately modeling cross-temporal point clouds spatial relationships for effective change feature extraction; (2) class imbalance of change samples which hinders distinguishability of semantic features; (3) the lack of real-world datasets for 3D semantic change detection. To resolve these challenges, we propose the Multi-task Enhanced Cross-temporal Point Transformer (ME-CPT) network. ME-CPT establishes spatiotemporal correspondences between point cloud across different epochs and employs attention mechanisms to jointly extract semantic change features, facilitating information exchange and change comparison. Additionally, we incorporate a semantic segmentation task and through the multi-task training strategy, further enhance the distinguishability of semantic features, reducing the impact of class imbalance in change types. Moreover, we release a 22.5 $km^2$ 3D semantic change detection dataset, offering diverse scenes for comprehensive evaluation.

High-quality datasets are crucial for the development of effective data-driven autonomous driving solutions. Next-generation autonomous driving datasets must be multimodal, incorporating data from advanced sensors that feature extensive data coverage, detailed annotations, and diverse scene representation. To address this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The OmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six 4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception. The dataset comprises 1501 clips, each approximately 30-s long, totaling more than 450K synchronized frames and more than 5.85 million synchronized sensor data points. We also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200 clips with more than 514K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include semantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we introduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy ground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames. Alongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics, baseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar to explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications.

However, recent FSS methods are observed to perform worse, when enlarging the number of shots. As the support set enlarges, existing FSS networks struggle to concentrate on the high-contributed supports and could easily be overwhelmed by the low-contributed supports that could severely impair the mask predictions. In this work, we study this challenging issue, called support dilution, our goal is to recognize, select, preserve, and enhance those high-contributed supports in the raw support pool. Technically, our method contains three novel parts. First, we propose a contribution index, to quantitatively estimate if a high-contributed support dilutes. Second, we develop the Symmetric Correlation (SC) module to preserve and enhance the high-contributed support features, minimizing the distraction by the low-contributed features. Third, we design the Support Image Pruning operation, to retrieve a compact and high quality subset by discarding low-contributed supports. We conduct extensive experiments on two FSS benchmarks, COCO-20i and PASCAL-5i, the segmentation results demonstrate the compelling performance of our solution over state-of-the-art FSS approaches. Besides, we apply our solution for online segmentation and real-world segmentation, convincing segmentation results showing the practical ability of our work for real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures | None |

Yet, despite often facing limited data availability when working with medical images, it is frequently underutilized. This appears to come from a gap in our collective understanding of the efficacy of different augmentation techniques across different tasks and modalities. One modality where this is especially true is ultrasound imaging. This work addresses this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of different augmentation techniques at improving model performance across a wide range of ultrasound image analysis tasks. To achieve this, we introduce a new standardized benchmark of 14 ultrasound image classification and semantic segmentation tasks from 10 different sources and covering 11 body regions. Our results demonstrate that many of the augmentations commonly used for tasks on natural images are also effective on ultrasound images, even more so than augmentations developed specifically for ultrasound images in some cases. We also show that diverse augmentation using TrivialAugment, which is widely used for natural images, is also effective for ultrasound images.

However, previous work has shown that most feature-level adaptation methods, which employ adversarial training and are validated on synthetic-to-real adaptation, provide marginal gains in condition-level adaptation, being outperformed by simple pixel-level adaptation via stylization. Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage stylization in performing feature-level adaptation by aligning the internal network features extracted by the encoder of the network from the original and the stylized view of each input image with a novel feature invariance loss. In this way, we encourage the encoder to extract features that are already invariant to the style of the input, allowing the decoder to focus on parsing these features and not on further abstracting from the specific style of the input. We implement our method, named Condition-Invariant Semantic Segmentation (CISS), on the current state-of-the-art domain adaptation architecture and achieve outstanding results on condition-level adaptation. In particular, CISS sets the new state of the art in the popular daytime-to-nighttime Cityscapes$\to$Dark Zurich benchmark. Furthermore, our method achieves the second-best performance on the normal-to-adverse Cityscapes$\to$ACDC benchmark. CISS is shown to generalize well to domains unseen during training, such as BDD100K-night and ACDC-night.

We tackle this challenge using auxiliary datasets from related vision tasks for an alternating training scheme with a shared decoder built on top of a pre-trained vision foundation model, while giving a higher weight to MDE. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the benefits of incorporating various in-domain auxiliary datasets and tasks to improve MDE quality on average by ~11%. Our experimental analysis shows that auxiliary tasks have different impacts, confirming the importance of task selection, highlighting that quality gains are not achieved by merely adding data. Remarkably, our study reveals that using semantic segmentation datasets as Multi-Label Dense Classification (MLDC) often results in additional quality gains. Lastly, our method significantly improves the data efficiency for the considered MDE datasets, enhancing their quality while reducing their size by at least 80%. This paves the way for using auxiliary data from related tasks to improve MDE quality despite limited availability of high-quality labeled data.

However, creating accurate, large-scale land cover datasets remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexities of geospatial data, such as diverse terrain, varying sensor modalities, and atmospheric conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its ability to penetrate clouds and capture data in all-weather, day-and-night conditions, offers unique advantages for land cover mapping. Despite these strengths, the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for SAR imagery has limited the development of robust models specifically designed for this data modality. To bridge this gap and facilitate advancements in SAR-based geospatial analysis, we introduce OpenEarthMap-SAR, a benchmark SAR dataset, for global high-resolution land cover mapping. OpenEarthMap-SAR consists of 1.5 million segments of 5033 aerial and satellite images with the size of 1024$\times$1024 pixels, covering 35 regions from Japan, France, and the USA, with partially manually annotated and fully pseudo 8-class land cover labels at a ground sampling distance of 0.15--0.5 m. We evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and present challenging problem settings suitable for further technical development. The dataset also serves the official dataset for IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track I. The dataset has been made publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/14622048.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Benchmarking Image Perturbations for Testing Automated Driving Assistance Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12269v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in autonomous vehicles for critical perception tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and lane recognition. However, these systems are highly sensitive to input variations, such as noise and changes in lighting, which can compromise their effectiveness and potentially lead to safety-critical failures. This study offers a comprehensive empirical evaluation of image perturbations, techniques commonly used to assess the robustness of DNNs, to validate and improve the robustness and generalization of ADAS perception systems. We first conducted a systematic review of the literature, identifying 38 categories of perturbations. Next, we evaluated their effectiveness in revealing failures in two different ADAS, both at the component and at the system level. Finally, we explored the use of perturbation-based data augmentation and continuous learning strategies to improve ADAS adaptation to new operational design domains. Our results demonstrate that all categories of image perturbations successfully expose robustness issues in ADAS and that the use of dataset augmentation and continuous learning significantly improves ADAS performance in novel, unseen environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 18th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[A margin-based replacement for cross-entropy loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12191v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-entropy (CE) loss is the de-facto standard for training deep neural networks to perform classification. However, CE-trained deep neural networks struggle with robustness and generalisation issues. To alleviate these issues, we propose high error margin (HEM) loss, a variant of multi-class margin loss that overcomes the training issues of other margin-based losses. We evaluate HEM extensively on a range of architectures and datasets. We find that HEM loss is more effective than cross-entropy loss across a wide range of tasks: unknown class rejection, adversarial robustness, learning with imbalanced data, continual learning, and semantic segmentation (a pixel-level classification task). Despite all training hyper-parameters being chosen for CE loss, HEM is inferior to CE only in terms of clean accuracy and this difference is insignificant. We also compare HEM to specialised losses that have previously been proposed to improve performance on specific tasks. LogitNorm, a loss achieving state-of-the-art performance on unknown class rejection, produces similar performance to HEM for this task, but is much poorer for continual learning and semantic segmentation. Logit-adjusted loss, designed for imbalanced data, has superior results to HEM for that task, but performs more poorly on unknown class rejection and semantic segmentation. DICE, a popular loss for semantic segmentation, is inferior to HEM loss on all tasks, including semantic segmentation. Thus, HEM often out-performs specialised losses, and in contrast to them, is a general-purpose replacement for CE loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://codeberg.org/mwspratling/HEMLoss</p></details> | None |

Typically, it relies on semantic segmentation or Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification to categorize each pixel. Despite the advancements brought about by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), their performance in segmentation tasks is hindered by challenges such as limited availability of labeled data, class imbalance and the inherent variability and complexity of satellite images. In order to mitigate those issues, our study explores the effectiveness of a Cut-and-Paste augmentation technique for semantic segmentation in satellite images. We adapt this augmentation, which usually requires labeled instances, to the case of semantic segmentation. By leveraging the connected components in the semantic segmentation labels, we extract instances that are then randomly pasted during training. Using the DynamicEarthNet dataset and a U-Net model for evaluation, we found that this augmentation significantly enhances the mIoU score on the test set from 37.9 to 44.1. This finding highlights the potential of the Cut-and-Paste augmentation to improve the generalization capabilities of semantic segmentation models in satellite imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: IGARSS 2024 - 2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium</p></details> | None |

Deep learning has massively advanced the field, but current approaches are mostly based on models trained for a specific task. Training such models or adapting them to a new condition is costly due to the need for (manually) labeled data. The emergence of vision foundation models, especially Segment Anything, offers a path to universal segmentation for medical images, overcoming these issues. Here, we study how to improve Segment Anything for medical images by comparing different finetuning strategies on a large and diverse dataset. We evaluate the finetuned models on a wide range of interactive and (automatic) semantic segmentation tasks. We find that the performance can be clearly improved for interactive segmentation. However, semantic segmentation does not benefit from pretraining on medical images. Our best model, MedicoSAM, is publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/medico-sam. We show that it is compatible with existing tools for data annotation and believe that it will be of great practical value.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/medico-sam) |

Traditional dropout, applied within the signal space, may fail to account for frequency-related noise common in medical imaging, leading to biased predictive estimates. A novel approach extends Dropout to the frequency domain, allowing stochastic attenuation of signal frequencies during inference. This creates diverse global textural variations in feature maps while preserving structural integrity -- a factor we hypothesize and empirically show is contributing to accurately estimating uncertainties in semantic segmentation. We evaluated traditional MC-Dropout and the MC-frequency Dropout in three segmentation tasks involving different imaging modalities: (i) prostate zones in biparametric MRI, (ii) liver tumors in contrast-enhanced CT, and (iii) lungs in chest X-ray scans. Our results show that MC-Frequency Dropout improves calibration, convergence, and semantic uncertainty, thereby improving prediction scrutiny, boundary delineation, and has the potential to enhance medical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISBI 2025 4-page paper.

| **[Physically Feasible Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14672v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models are typically optimized in a data-driven fashion, minimizing solely per-pixel or per-segment classification objectives on their training data. This purely data-driven paradigm often leads to absurd segmentations, especially when the domain of input images is shifted from the one encountered during training. For instance, state-of-the-art models may assign the label ``road to a segment that is located above a segment that is respectively labeled as ``sky, although our knowledge of the physical world dictates that such a configuration is not feasible for images captured by forward-facing upright cameras. Our method, Physically Feasible Semantic Segmentation (PhyFea), first extracts explicit constraints that govern spatial class relations from the semantic segmentation training set at hand in an offline, data-driven fashion, and then enforces a morphological yet differentiable loss that penalizes violations of these constraints during training to promote prediction feasibility. PhyFea is a plug-and-play method and yields consistent and significant performance improvements over diverse state-of-the-art networks on which we implement it across the ADE20K, Cityscapes, and ACDC datasets. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of two approaches for segmenting glandular structures in prostate images to automate Gleason grading. The first approach utilizes a hand-crafted learning technique, combining Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture descriptors to highlight spatial dependencies and minimize information loss at the pixel level. For machine driven feature extraction, we employ a U-Net convolutional neural network to perform semantic segmentation of prostate gland stroma tissue. Support vector machine-based learning of hand-crafted features achieves impressive classification accuracies of 99.0% and 95.1% for GLCM and LBP, respectively, while the U-Net-based machine-driven features attain 94% accuracy. Furthermore, a comparative analysis demonstrates superior segmentation quality for histopathological grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the U-Net approach, as assessed by Jaccard and Dice metrics. This work underscores the utility of machine-driven features in clinical applications that rely on automated pixel-level segmentation in prostate tissue images.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Multi-task Supervised Compression Model for Split Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01420v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Split computing ($\neq$ split learning) is a promising approach to deep learning models for resource-constrained edge computing systems, where weak sensor (mobile) devices are wirelessly connected to stronger edge servers through channels with limited communication capacity. State-of-theart work on split computing presents methods for single tasks such as image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. The application of existing methods to multitask problems degrades model accuracy and/or significantly increase runtime latency. In this study, we propose Ladon, the first multi-task-head supervised compression model for multi-task split computing. Experimental results show that the multi-task supervised compression model either outperformed or rivaled strong lightweight baseline models in terms of predictive performance for ILSVRC 2012, COCO 2017, and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets while learning compressed representations at its early layers.

Existing methods typically employ a two-branch encoder framework for multimodal feature extraction and design complicated feature fusion strategies to achieve feature extraction and fusion for multimodal semantic segmentation. However, these methods require massive parameter updates and computational effort during the feature extraction and fusion. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal fusion network (EFNet) based on an early fusion strategy and a simple but effective feature clustering for training efficient RGB-T semantic segmentation. In addition, we also propose a lightweight and efficient multi-scale feature aggregation decoder based on Euclidean distance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on different datasets and outperform previous state-of-the-art methods with lower parameters and computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |

Yet, the joint synthesis of (image, mask) pairs for segmentation, a major application in surgery, is rather unexplored. We propose to learn semantically comprehensive yet compact latent representations of the (image, mask) space, which we jointly model with a Latent Diffusion Model. We show that our approach can effectively synthesise unseen high-quality paired segmentation data of remarkable semantic coherence. Generative augmentation is typically applied pre-training by synthesising a fixed number of additional training samples to improve downstream task models. To enhance this approach, we further propose Generative Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Diffusion-based Augmentation (GAUDA), leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of a Bayesian downstream model for targeted online synthesis. We condition the generative model on classes with high estimated uncertainty during training to produce additional unseen samples for these classes. By adaptively utilising the generative model online, we can minimise the number of additional training samples and centre them around the currently most uncertain parts of the data distribution. GAUDA effectively improves downstream segmentation results over comparable methods by an average absolute IoU of 1.6% on CaDISv2 and 1.5% on CholecSeg8k, two prominent surgical datasets for semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite synthetic point clouds (SPC) having the potential to compensate for data shortage, how synthetic color and mixing proportion impact DL-based segmentation remains a long-standing question. Therefore, this paper addresses this question with extensive experiments by introducing: 1) method to generate SPC with real colors and uniform colors from BIM, and 2) enhanced benchmarks for better performance evaluation. Experiments on DL models including PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN show that model performance on SPC with real colors outperforms that on SPC with uniform colors by 8.2 % + on both OA and mIoU. Furthermore, a higher than 70 % mixing proportion of SPC usually leads to better performance. And SPC can replace real ones to train a DL model for detecting large and flat building elements. Overall, this paper unveils the performance-improving mechanism of SPC and brings new insights to boost SPC's value (for building large models for point clouds).</p></details> |  | None |

However, RS images pose unique challenges, including rich multi-scale features and high inter-class similarity. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised Multi-Scale Uncertainty and Cross-Teacher-Student Attention (MUCA) model for RS image semantic segmentation tasks. Specifically, MUCA constrains the consistency among feature maps at different layers of the network by introducing a multi-scale uncertainty consistency regularization. It improves the multi-scale learning capability of semi-supervised algorithms on unlabeled data. Additionally, MUCA utilizes a Cross-Teacher-Student attention mechanism to guide the student network, guiding the student network to construct more discriminative feature representations through complementary features from the teacher network. This design effectively integrates weak and strong augmentations (WA and SA) to further boost segmentation performance. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS-Potsdam and LoveDA datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Notably, our model excels in distinguishing highly similar objects, showcasing its potential for advancing semi-supervised RS image segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method integrates the foundation models CLIPSeg and Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the interest point detector SuperPoint and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to accurately segment machinery parts. By providing 1 to 25 annotated samples, our model, evaluated on a purely synthetic dataset depicting a truck-mounted loading crane, achieves effective segmentation across various levels of detail. Training times are kept under five minutes on consumer GPUs. The model demonstrates robust generalization to real data, achieving a qualitative synthetic-to-real generalization with a $J\&F$ score of 92.2 on real data using 10 synthetic support samples. When benchmarked on the DAVIS 2017 dataset, it achieves a $J\&F$ score of 71.5 in semi-supervised video segmentation with three support samples.

Existing methods often fail under challenges like illumination differences, viewpoint changes, blur effects, leading to inaccuracies, especially in no-change regions. Moreover, the images acquired at different spatial resolutions and have registration errors tend to affect the captions. To address these issues, we introduce SECOND-CC, a novel RSICC dataset featuring high-resolution RGB image pairs, semantic segmentation maps, and diverse real-world scenarios. SECOND-CC which contains 6,041 pairs of bitemporal RS images and 30,205 sentences describing the differences between images.

Although the amount of information varies across images, most image tokenizers only support fixed-length tokenization, leading to inefficiency in token allocation. In this study, we introduce One-D-Piece, a discrete image tokenizer designed for variable-length tokenization, achieving quality-controllable mechanism. To enable variable compression rate, we introduce a simple but effective regularization mechanism named "Tail Token Drop" into discrete one-dimensional image tokenizers. This method encourages critical information to concentrate at the head of the token sequence, enabling support of variadic tokenization, while preserving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. We evaluate our tokenizer across multiple reconstruction quality metrics and find that it delivers significantly better perceptual quality than existing quality-controllable compression methods, including JPEG and WebP, at smaller byte sizes. Furthermore, we assess our tokenizer on various downstream computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation, confirming its adaptability to numerous applications compared to other variable-rate methods. Our approach demonstrates the versatility of variable-length discrete image tokenization, establishing a new paradigm in both compression efficiency and reconstruction performance.

However, they encounter numerous challenges that hinder effective feature extraction, including the detection and recognition of multiple objects exhibiting substantial variations in scale within a single image. While prior dual-branch or multi-branch architectural strategies have been effective in managing these object variances, they have concurrently resulted in considerable increases in computational demands and parameter counts. Consequently, these architectures are rendered less viable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Contemporary lightweight backbone networks, designed primarily for natural images, frequently encounter difficulties in effectively extracting features from multi-scale objects, which compromises their efficacy in RS visual tasks. This article introduces LWGANet, a specialized lightweight backbone network tailored for RS visual tasks, incorporating a novel lightweight group attention (LWGA) module designed to address these specific challenges. LWGA module, tailored for RS imagery, adeptly harnesses redundant features to extract a wide range of spatial information, from local to global scales, without introducing additional complexity or computational overhead. This facilitates precise feature extraction across multiple scales within an efficient framework.LWGANet was rigorously evaluated across twelve datasets, which span four crucial RS visual tasks: scene classification, oriented object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection. The results confirm LWGANet's widespread applicability and its ability to maintain an optimal balance between high performance and low complexity, achieving SOTA results across diverse datasets. LWGANet emerged as a novel solution for resource-limited scenarios requiring robust RS image processing capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Remote sensing</p></details> | None |

Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has provided an alternative to generate localization maps from class-patch attention. However, due to insufficient constraints on modeling such attention, we observe that the Localization Attention Maps (LAM) often struggle with the artifact issue, i.e., patch regions with minimal semantic relevance are falsely activated by class tokens. In this work, we propose MoRe to address this issue and further explore the potential of LAM. Our findings suggest that imposing additional regularization on class-patch attention is necessary. To this end, we first view the attention as a novel directed graph and propose the Graph Category Representation module to implicitly regularize the interaction among class-patch entities. It ensures that class tokens dynamically condense the related patch information and suppress unrelated artifacts at a graph level. Second, motivated by the observation that CAM from classification weights maintains smooth localization of objects, we devise the Localization-informed Regularization module to explicitly regularize the class-patch attention. It directly mines the token relations from CAM and further supervises the consistency between class and patch tokens in a learnable manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, validating that MoRe effectively addresses the artifact issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent single-stage and even multi-stage methods.

In an effort to shed light on this, we evaluate Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Sub-Ensembles, and Deep Ensembles for joint semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation. Thereby, we reveal that Deep Ensembles stand out as the preferred choice, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios, and show the potential benefit of multi-task learning with regard to the uncertainty quality in comparison to solving both tasks separately. Additionally, we highlight the impact of employing different uncertainty thresholds to classify pixels as certain or uncertain, with the median uncertainty emerging as a robust default.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of a previously published conference paper and is currently in review for a journal</p></details> | None |

By exploiting this camera-LiDAR setup and recent advances in image representation learning, prior studies have shown the promising potential of image-to-LiDAR distillation. These prior arts focus on the designs of their own losses to effectively distill the pre-trained 2D image representations into a 3D model. However, the other parts of the designs have been surprisingly unexplored. We find that fundamental design elements, e.g., the LiDAR coordinate system, quantization according to the existing input interface, and data utilization, are more critical than developing loss functions, which have been overlooked in prior works. In this work, we show that simple fixes to these designs notably outperform existing methods by 16% in 3D semantic segmentation on the nuScenes dataset and 13% in 3D object detection on the KITTI dataset in downstream task performance. We focus on overlooked design choices along the spatial and temporal axes. Spatially, prior work has used cylindrical coordinate and voxel sizes without considering their side effects yielded with a commonly deployed sparse convolution layer input interface, leading to spatial quantization errors in 3D models. Temporally, existing work has avoided cumbersome data curation by discarding unsynced data, limiting the use to only the small portion of data that is temporally synced across sensors. We analyze these effects and propose simple solutions for each overlooked aspect.</p></details> | Accepted to ACCV2024 | None |

Compared with the best-performing surgical foundation models, SurgeNetXL shows mean improvements of 2.4, 9.0, and 12.6 percent for semantic segmentation, phase recognition, and CVS classification, respectively. Additionally, SurgeNetXL outperforms the best-performing ImageNet-based variants by 14.4, 4.0, and 1.6 percent in the respective tasks. In addition to advancing model performance, this study provides key insights into scaling pretraining datasets, extending training durations, and optimizing model architectures specifically for surgical computer vision. These findings pave the way for improved generalizability and robustness in data-scarce scenarios, offering a comprehensive framework for future research in this domain. All models and a subset of the SurgeNetXL dataset, including over 2 million video frames, are publicly available at: https://github.com/TimJaspers0801/SurgeNet.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TimJaspers0801/SurgeNet) |
| **[SVIA: A Street View Image Anonymization Framework for Self-Driving Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09393v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in image anonymization, particularly focusing on the de-identification of faces and individuals. However, for self-driving applications, merely de-identifying faces and individuals might not provide sufficient privacy protection since street views like vehicles and buildings can still disclose locations, trajectories, and other sensitive information. Therefore, it remains crucial to extend anonymization techniques to street view images to fully preserve the privacy of users, pedestrians, and vehicles. In this paper, we propose a Street View Image Anonymization (SVIA) framework for self-driving applications. The SVIA framework consists of three integral components: a semantic segmenter to segment an input image into functional regions, an inpainter to generate alternatives to privacy-sensitive regions, and a harmonizer to seamlessly stitch modified regions to guarantee visual coherence. Compared to existing methods, SVIA achieves a much better trade-off between image generation quality and privacy protection, as evidenced by experimental results for five common metrics on two widely used public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables.

Acquiring such annotations can be costly in the real-world. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation is a technique that uses virtual data with labels to train a model and adapts it to real data without labels. Some recent works use contrastive learning, which is a powerful method for self-supervised learning, to help with this technique. However, these works do not take into account the diversity of features within each class when using contrastive learning, which leads to errors in class prediction. We analyze the limitations of these works and propose a novel framework called Pseudo-label Guided Pixel Contrast (PGPC), which overcomes the disadvantages of previous methods. We also investigate how to use more information from target images without adding noise from pseudo-labels. We test our method on two standard UDA benchmarks and show that it outperforms existing methods. Specifically, we achieve relative improvements of 5.1% mIoU and 4.6% mIoU on the Grand Theft Auto V (GTA5) to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes tasks based on DAFormer, respectively. Furthermore, our approach can enhance the performance of other UDA approaches without increasing model complexity.

There is a recent trend to combine paired satellite images and text captions for pretraining performant encoders for downstream tasks. However, while contrastive image-text methods like CLIP enable vision-language alignment and zero-shot classification ability, vision-only downstream performance tends to degrade compared to image-only pretraining, such as MAE. In this paper, we propose FLAVARS, a pretraining method that combines the best of both contrastive learning and masked modeling, along with geospatial alignment via contrastive location encoding. We find that FLAVARS significantly outperforms a baseline of SkyCLIP for vision-only tasks such as KNN classification and semantic segmentation, +6\% mIOU on SpaceNet1, while retaining the ability to perform zero-shot classification, unlike MAE pretrained methods.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces FUTURIST, a method for multimodal future semantic prediction that uses a unified and efficient visual sequence transformer architecture. Our approach incorporates a multimodal masked visual modeling objective and a novel masking mechanism designed for multimodal training. This allows the model to effectively integrate visible information from various modalities, improving prediction accuracy.

Metric depth estimation, which involves predicting absolute distances, poses particular challenges, as even the most advanced foundation models remain prone to critical errors. Since quantifying the uncertainty has emerged as a promising endeavor to address these limitations and enable trustworthy deployment, we fuse five different uncertainty quantification methods with the current state-of-the-art DepthAnythingV2 foundation model. To cover a wide range of metric depth domains, we evaluate their performance on four diverse datasets. Our findings identify fine-tuning with the Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood Loss (GNLL) as a particularly promising approach, offering reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining predictive performance and computational efficiency on par with the baseline, encompassing both training and inference time. By fusing uncertainty quantification and foundation models within the context of monocular depth estimation, this paper lays a critical foundation for future research aimed at improving not only model performance but also its explainability. Extending this critical synthesis of uncertainty quantification and foundation models into other crucial tasks, such as semantic segmentation and pose estimation, presents exciting opportunities for safer and more reliable machine vision systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rethinking Decoders for Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation: A Compression Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03033v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for Transformer-based semantic segmentation typically adopt Transformer decoders that are used to extract additional embeddings from image embeddings via cross-attention, refine either or both types of embeddings via self-attention, and project image embeddings onto the additional embeddings via dot-product. Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Threshold Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07984v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is essential for various applications, including vegetation monitoring, disaster management, and urban planning. Previous studies have demonstrated that the self-attention mechanism (SA) is an effective approach for designing segmentation networks that can capture long-range pixel dependencies. SA enables the network to model the global dependencies between the input features, resulting in improved segmentation outcomes. However, the high density of attentional feature maps used in this mechanism causes exponential increases in computational complexity. Additionally, it introduces redundant information that negatively impacts the feature representation. Inspired by traditional threshold segmentation algorithms, we propose a novel threshold attention mechanism (TAM). This mechanism significantly reduces computational effort while also better modeling the correlation between different regions of the feature map. Based on TAM, we present a threshold attention network (TANet) for semantic segmentation. TANet consists of an attentional feature enhancement module (AFEM) for global feature enhancement of shallow features and a threshold attention pyramid pooling module (TAPP) for acquiring feature information at different scales for deep features. We have conducted extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets. The results demonstrate the validity and superiority of our proposed TANet compared to the most state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Balance Divergence for Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07804v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation has been widely adopted in computer vision task processing, since it can effectively enhance the performance of lightweight student networks by leveraging the knowledge transferred from cumbersome teacher networks. Most existing knowledge distillation methods utilize Kullback-Leibler divergence to mimic the logit output probabilities between the teacher network and the student network. Nonetheless, these methods may neglect the negative parts of the teacher's ''dark knowledge'' because the divergence calculations may ignore the effect of the minute probabilities from the teacher's logit output. This deficiency may lead to suboptimal performance in logit mimicry during the distillation process and result in an imbalance of information acquired by the student network. In this paper, we investigate the impact of this imbalance and propose a novel method, named Balance Divergence Distillation. By introducing a compensatory operation using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, our method can improve the modeling of the extremely small values in the negative from the teacher and preserve the learning capacity for the positive. Furthermore, we test the impact of different temperature coefficients adjustments, which may conducted to further balance for knowledge transferring. We evaluate the proposed method on several computer vision tasks, including image classification and semantic segmentation. The evaluation results show that our method achieves an accuracy improvement of 1%~3% for lightweight students on both CIFAR-100 and ImageNet dataset, and a 4.55% improvement in mIoU for PSP-ResNet18 on the Cityscapes dataset. The experiments show that our method is a simple yet highly effective solution that can be smoothly applied to different knowledge distillation methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07390v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in remote sensing applications, where the accurate extraction and representation of features are essential for high-quality results. Despite the widespread use of encoder-decoder architectures, existing methods often struggle with fully utilizing the high-dimensional features extracted by the encoder and efficiently recovering detailed information during decoding. To address these problems, we propose a novel semantic segmentation network, namely DeepKANSeg, including two key innovations based on the emerging Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN). Notably, the advantage of KAN lies in its ability to decompose high-dimensional complex functions into univariate transformations, enabling efficient and flexible representation of intricate relationships in data. First, we introduce a KAN-based deep feature refinement module, namely DeepKAN to effectively capture complex spatial and rich semantic relationships from high-dimensional features. Second, we replace the traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers in the global-local combined decoder with KAN-based linear layers, namely GLKAN. This module enhances the decoder's ability to capture fine-grained details during decoding. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on two well-known fine-resolution remote sensing benchmark datasets, namely ISPRS Vaihingen and ISPRS Potsdam. The results demonstrate that the KAN-enhanced segmentation model achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. They highlight the potential of KANs as a powerful alternative to traditional architectures in semantic segmentation tasks. Moreover, the explicit univariate decomposition provides improved interpretability, which is particularly beneficial for applications requiring explainable learning in remote sensing.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures | None |

It estimates missing geometric and semantic information in the acquired scene data. Due to the challenging real-world conditions, this task usually demands complex models that process multi-modal data to achieve acceptable performance. We propose a unique neural model, leveraging advances from the state space and diffusion generative modeling to achieve remarkable 3D semantic scene completion performance with monocular image input. Our technique processes the data in the conditioned latent space of a variational autoencoder where diffusion modeling is carried out with an innovative state space technique. A key component of our neural network is the proposed Skimba (Skip Mamba) denoiser, which is adept at efficiently processing long-sequence data. The Skimba diffusion model is integral to our 3D scene completion network, incorporating a triple Mamba structure, dimensional decomposition residuals and varying dilations along three directions. We also adopt a variant of this network for the subsequent semantic segmentation stage of our method. Extensive evaluation on the standard SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 datasets show that our approach not only outperforms other monocular techniques by a large margin, it also achieves competitive performance against stereo methods.

However, the quadratic complexity of transformer makes computation costs high, limiting the number of points that can be processed simultaneously and impeding the modeling of long-range dependencies between objects in a single scene. Drawing inspiration from the great potential of recent state space models (SSM) for long sequence modeling, we introduce Mamba, an SSM-based architecture, to the point cloud domain and propose Pamba, a novel architecture with strong global modeling capability under linear complexity. Specifically, to make the disorderness of point clouds fit in with the causal nature of Mamba, we propose a multi-path serialization strategy applicable to point clouds. Besides, we propose the ConvMamba block to compensate for the shortcomings of Mamba in modeling local geometries and in unidirectional modeling. Pamba obtains state-of-the-art results on several 3D point cloud segmentation tasks, including ScanNet v2, ScanNet200, S3DIS and nuScenes, while its effectiveness is validated by extensive experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LarvSeg: Exploring Image Classification Data For Large Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation via Category-wise Attentive Classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06862v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling up the vocabulary of semantic segmentation models is extremely challenging because annotating large-scale mask labels is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Recently, language-guided segmentation models have been proposed to address this challenge. However, their performance drops significantly when applied to out-of-distribution categories. In this paper, we propose a new large vocabulary semantic segmentation framework, called LarvSeg. Different from previous works, LarvSeg leverages image classification data to scale the vocabulary of semantic segmentation models as large-vocabulary classification datasets usually contain balanced categories and are much easier to obtain. However, for classification tasks, the category is image-level, while for segmentation we need to predict the label at pixel level. To address this issue, we first propose a general baseline framework to incorporate image-level supervision into the training process of a pixel-level segmentation model, making the trained network perform semantic segmentation on newly introduced categories in the classification data. We then observe that a model trained on segmentation data can group pixel features of categories beyond the training vocabulary. Inspired by this finding, we design a category-wise attentive classifier to apply supervision to the precise regions of corresponding categories to improve the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LarvSeg significantly improves the large vocabulary semantic segmentation performance, especially in the categories without mask labels. For the first time, we provide a 21K-category semantic segmentation model with the help of ImageNet21K.

Since precise pixel-level annotations are not accessible, existing methods typically focus on producing pseudo masks for training segmentation models by refining CAM-like heatmaps. However, the produced heatmaps may capture only the discriminative image regions of object categories or the associated co-occurring backgrounds. To address the issues, we propose a Semantic Prompt Learning for WSSS (SemPLeS) framework, which learns to effectively prompt the CLIP latent space to enhance the semantic alignment between the segmented regions and the target object categories. More specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt Learning and Prompt-guided Semantic Refinement to learn the prompts that adequately describe and suppress the co-occurring backgrounds associated with each object category. In this way, SemPLeS can perform better semantic alignment between object regions and class labels, resulting in desired pseudo masks for training segmentation models. The proposed SemPLeS framework achieves competitive performance on standard WSSS benchmarks, PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014, and shows compatibility with other WSSS methods.

To address this, we propose a novel SAM adapter approach that minimizes the number of trainable parameters while achieving comparable performances to full fine-tuning. The proposed SAM adapter is strategically placed in the mask decoder, offering excellent and broad generalization capabilities and improved segmentation across both fully supervised and test-time domain adaptation tasks. Extensive validation on four datasets showcases the adapter's efficacy, outperforming existing methods while training less than 1% of SAM's total parameters.</p></details> | WACV25 | None |

Despite the progress has been achieved, current FSMIS models are all trained and deployed on the same data domain, as is not consistent with the clinical reality that medical imaging data is always across different data domains (e.g. imaging modalities, institutions and equipment sequences). How to enhance the FSMIS models to generalize well across the different specific medical imaging domains? In this paper, we focus on the matching mechanism of the few-shot semantic segmentation models and introduce an Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) calculation based domain robust matching mechanism for the cross-domain scenario. Specifically, we formulate the EMD transportation process between the foreground support-query features, the texture structure aware weights generation method, which proposes to perform the sobel based image gradient calculation over the nodes, is introduced in the EMD matching flow to restrain the domain relevant nodes. Besides, the point set level distance measurement metric is introduced to calculated the cost for the transportation from support set nodes to query set nodes. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conduct experiments on three scenarios (i.e., cross-modal, cross-sequence and cross-institution), which includes eight medical datasets and involves three body regions, and the results demonstrate that our model achieves the SoTA performance against the compared models.</p></details> |  | None |

This also results in longer training and inference time for DDPMs compared to non-DDPMs. From a different perspective, we delve deeply into the model paradigm dominated by the Conditional Network. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end robust semantic Segmentation Network based on a Conditional-Noise Framework (CNF) of DDPMs, named CDSegNet. Specifically, CDSegNet models the Noise Network (NN) as a learnable noise-feature generator. This enables the Conditional Network (CN) to understand 3D scene semantics under multi-level feature perturbations, enhancing the generalization in unseen scenes. Meanwhile, benefiting from the noise system of DDPMs, CDSegNet exhibits strong noise and sparsity robustness in experiments. Moreover, thanks to CNF, CDSegNet can generate the semantic labels in a single-step inference like non-DDPMs, due to avoiding directly fitting the scores from semantic labels in the dominant network of CDSegNet. On public indoor and outdoor benchmarks, CDSegNet significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Standard models trained on data recorded under ideal conditions show a deteriorated performance in unfavorable weather or illumination conditions. Fine-tuning on the new task or condition would lead to overwriting the previously learned information resulting in catastrophic forgetting. Adapting to the new conditions through traditional domain adaption methods improves the performance on the target domain at the expense of the source domain. Addressing these issues, we propose an architecture-based domain-incremental learning approach called Progressive Semantic Segmentation (PSS). PSS is a task-agnostic, dynamically growing collection of domain-specific segmentation models. The task of inferring the domain and subsequently selecting the appropriate module for segmentation is carried out using a collection of convolutional autoencoders. We extensively evaluate our proposed approach using several datasets at varying levels of granularity in the categorization of adverse driving conditions.

However, this approach remains largely underexplored for airborne laser scanning (ALS), an important technology for applications such as forest management and urban planning. In this study, we address this gap by constructing a large-scale ALS point cloud dataset and evaluating its impact on downstream applications. Our dataset comprises ALS point clouds collected across the contiguous United States, provided by the United States Geological Survey's 3D Elevation Program. To ensure efficient data collection while capturing diverse land cover and terrain types, we introduce a geospatial sampling method that selects point cloud tiles based on land cover maps and digital elevation models. As a baseline self-supervised learning model, we adopt BEV-MAE, a state-of-the-art masked autoencoder for 3D outdoor point clouds, and pre-train it on the constructed dataset. The pre-trained models are subsequently fine-tuned for downstream tasks, including tree species classification, terrain scene recognition, and point cloud semantic segmentation. Our results show that the pre-trained models significantly outperform their scratch counterparts across all downstream tasks, demonstrating the transferability of the representations learned from the proposed dataset. Furthermore, we observe that scaling the dataset using our geospatial sampling method consistently enhances performance, whereas pre-training on datasets constructed with random sampling fails to achieve similar improvements. These findings highlight the utility of the constructed dataset and the effectiveness of our sampling strategy in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm.

Among recent works, UniMatch improves its precedents tremendously by amplifying the practice of weak-to-strong consistency regularization. Subsequent works typically follow similar pipelines and propose various delicate designs. Despite the achieved progress, strangely, even in this flourishing era of numerous powerful vision models, almost all SSS works are still sticking to 1) using outdated ResNet encoders with small-scale ImageNet-1K pre-training, and 2) evaluation on simple Pascal and Cityscapes datasets. In this work, we argue that, it is necessary to switch the baseline of SSS from ResNet-based encoders to more capable ViT-based encoders (e.g., DINOv2) that are pre-trained on massive data. A simple update on the encoder (even using 2x fewer parameters) can bring more significant improvement than careful method designs. Built on this competitive baseline, we present our upgraded and simplified UniMatch V2, inheriting the core spirit of weak-to-strong consistency from V1, but requiring less training cost and providing consistently better results. Additionally, witnessing the gradually saturated performance on Pascal and Cityscapes, we appeal that we should focus on more challenging benchmarks with complex taxonomy, such as ADE20K and COCO datasets.

While current open vocabulary approaches show impressive performance on standard segmentation benchmarks under zero-shot settings, they fall short of supervised counterparts on highly domain-specific datasets. We focus on segmentation-specific test-time optimization to address this gap. Segmentation requires an understanding of multiple concepts within a single image while retaining the locality and spatial structure of representations. We propose a novel self-supervised objective adhering to these requirements and use it to align the model parameters with input images at test time. In the textual modality, we learn multiple embeddings for each category to capture diverse concepts within an image, while in the visual modality, we calculate pixel-level losses followed by embedding aggregation operations specific to preserving spatial structure. Our resulting framework termed Seg-TTO is a plug-in-play module.

However, ViTs often struggle to model local spatial information effectively, which is essential for accurately segmenting fine anatomical details, particularly when applied to small datasets without extensive pre-training. We introduce Gabor and Laplacian of Gaussian Convolutional Swin Network (GLoG-CSUnet), a novel architecture enhancing Transformer-based models by incorporating learnable radiomic features. This approach integrates dynamically adaptive Gabor and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters to capture texture, edge, and boundary information, enhancing the feature representation processed by the Transformer model. Our method uniquely combines the long-range dependency modeling of Transformers with the texture analysis capabilities of Gabor and LoG features. Evaluated on the Synapse multi-organ and ACDC cardiac segmentation datasets, GLoG-CSUnet demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models, achieving a 1.14% increase in Dice score for Synapse and 0.99% for ACDC, with minimal computational overhead (only 15 and 30 additional parameters, respectively). GLoG-CSUnet's flexible design allows integration with various base models, offering a promising approach for incorporating radiomics-inspired feature extraction in Transformer architectures for medical image analysis.

However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable "Reference" prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in the vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into different features, i.e., the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between the Reference feature and the positional feature, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and the rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. A contrastive loss based on the masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed, which makes the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

Tissue segmentation is a core challenge, essential for prognosis and treatment decisions. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) reduces the annotation requirement by using image-level labels instead of pixel-level ones. However, Class Activation Map (CAM)-based methods still suffer from low spatial resolution and unclear boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level superpixel correction algorithm that refines CAM boundaries using superpixel clustering and floodfill. Experimental results show that our method achieves great performance on breast cancer segmentation dataset with mIoU of 71.08%, significantly improving tumor microenvironment boundary delineation.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Multi-source Domain Adaptation for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16469v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation methods for panoramic semantic segmentation utilize real pinhole images or low-cost synthetic panoramic images to transfer segmentation models to real panoramic images. However, these methods struggle to understand the panoramic structure using only real pinhole images and lack real-world scene perception with only synthetic panoramic images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new task, Multi-source Domain Adaptation for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (MSDA4PASS), which leverages both real pinhole and synthetic panoramic images to improve segmentation on unlabeled real panoramic images. There are two key issues in the MSDA4PASS task: (1) distortion gaps between the pinhole and panoramic domains -- panoramic images exhibit global and local distortions absent in pinhole images; (2) texture gaps between the source and target domains -- scenes and styles differ across domains. To address these two issues, we propose a novel framework, Deformation Transform Aligner for Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (DTA4PASS), which converts all pinhole images in the source domains into distorted images and aligns the source distorted and panoramic images with the target panoramic images. Specifically, DTA4PASS consists of two main components: Unpaired Semantic Morphing (USM) and Distortion Gating Alignment (DGA). First, in USM, the Dual-view Discriminator (DvD) assists in training the diffeomorphic deformation network at the image and pixel level, enabling the effective deformation transformation of pinhole images without paired panoramic views, alleviating distortion gaps. Second, DGA assigns pinhole-like (pin-like) and panoramic-like (pan-like) features to each image by gating, and aligns these two features through uncertainty estimation, reducing texture gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion 2025</p></details> | None |

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

The ability of a learning-based model to accurately perceive dense 3D surroundings often ensures the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. However, existing LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation databases consist of sequentially acquired LiDAR scans that are long-tailed and lack training diversity. In this report, we introduce MixSeg3D, a sophisticated combination of the strong point cloud segmentation model with advanced 3D data mixing strategies. Specifically, our approach integrates the MinkUNet family with LaserMix and PolarMix, two scene-scale data augmentation methods that blend LiDAR point clouds along the ego-scene's inclination and azimuth directions. Through empirical experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of MixSeg3D over the baseline and prior arts.

| **[Unsupervised Class Generation to Expand Semantic Segmentation Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02264v1)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task where classification is performed at a pixel level. Due to this, the process of labeling images for semantic segmentation is time-consuming and expensive. To mitigate this cost there has been a surge in the use of synthetically generated data -- usually created using simulators or videogames -- which, in combination with domain adaptation methods, can effectively learn how to segment real data. Still, these datasets have a particular limitation: due to their closed-set nature, it is not possible to include novel classes without modifying the tool used to generate them, which is often not public. Concurrently, generative models have made remarkable progress, particularly with the introduction of diffusion models, enabling the creation of high-quality images from text prompts without additional supervision. In this work, we propose an unsupervised pipeline that leverages Stable Diffusion and Segment Anything Module to generate class examples with an associated segmentation mask, and a method to integrate generated cutouts for novel classes in semantic segmentation datasets, all with minimal user input. Our approach aims to improve the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation methods by introducing novel samples into the training data without modifications to the underlying algorithms. With our methods, we show how models can not only effectively learn how to segment novel classes, with an average performance of 51% IoU, but also reduce errors for other, already existing classes, reaching a higher performance level overall.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic-guided modeling of spatial relation and object co-occurrence for indoor scene recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12661v5)** | 2025-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the semantic context in scene images is essential for indoor scene recognition. However, due to the diverse intra-class spatial layouts and the coexisting inter-class objects, modeling contextual relationships to adapt various image characteristics is a great challenge. Existing contextual modeling methods for scene recognition exhibit two limitations: 1) They typically model only one type of spatial relationship (order or metric) among objects within scenes, with limited exploration of diverse spatial layouts. 2) They often overlook the differences in coexisting objects across different scenes, suppressing scene recognition performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose SpaCoNet, which simultaneously models Spatial relation and Co-occurrence of objects guided by semantic segmentation. Firstly, the Semantic Spatial Relation Module (SSRM) is constructed to model scene spatial features. With the help of semantic segmentation, this module decouples spatial information from the scene image and thoroughly explores all spatial relationships among objects in an implicit manner, thereby obtaining semantic-based spatial features. Secondly, both spatial features from the SSRM and deep features from the Image Feature Extraction Module are allocated to each object, so as to distinguish the coexisting object across different scenes. Finally, utilizing the discriminative features above, we design a Global-Local Dependency Module to explore the long-range co-occurrence among objects, and further generate a semantic-guided feature representation for indoor scene recognition. Experimental results on three widely used scene datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> | None |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) show remarkable performance in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, very few have been proposed for instance segmentation in vision-based autonomous driving. Moreover, existing methods rely on suboptimal baselines, which severely limits performance. We introduce \textbf{UDA4Inst}, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through \textit{Semantic Category Training} and \textit{Bidirectional Mixing Training}. With the Semantic Category Training method, semantically related classes are grouped and trained separately, enabling the generation of higher-quality pseudo-labels and improved segmentation performance. We further propose a bidirectional cross-domain data mixing strategy that combines instance-wise and patch-wise mixing techniques to effectively utilize data from both source and target domains, producing realistic composite images that improve the model's generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes benchmark with mAP 31.3. Notably, we are the first to report results on multiple novel synth-to-real instance segmentation datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as source domains while Cityscapes and KITTI360 serve as target domains.

| **[InvSeg: Test-Time Prompt Inversion for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11473v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-textual correlations in the attention maps derived from text-to-image diffusion models are proven beneficial to dense visual prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation. However, a significant challenge arises due to the input distributional discrepancy between the context-rich sentences used for image generation and the isolated class names typically used in semantic segmentation. This discrepancy hinders diffusion models from capturing accurate visual-textual correlations. To solve this, we propose InvSeg, a test-time prompt inversion method that tackles open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by inverting image-specific visual context into text prompt embedding space, leveraging structure information derived from the diffusion model's reconstruction process to enrich text prompts so as to associate each class with a structure-consistent mask. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive Soft Clustering (CSC) to align derived masks with the image's structure information, softly selecting anchors for each class and calculating weighted distances to push inner-class pixels closer while separating inter-class pixels, thereby ensuring mask distinction and internal consistency. By incorporating sample-specific context, InvSeg learns context-rich text prompts in embedding space and achieves accurate semantic alignment across modalities. Experiments show that InvSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context and COCO Object datasets.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[Semantic Segmentation for Sequential Historical Maps by Learning from Only One Map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01845v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical maps are valuable resources that capture detailed geographical information from the past. However, these maps are typically available in printed formats, which are not conducive to modern computer-based analyses. Digitizing these maps into a machine-readable format enables efficient computational analysis. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to digitization using deep-learning-based semantic segmentation, which assigns a semantic label to each pixel in scanned historical maps. A key challenge in this process is the lack of ground-truth annotations required for training deep neural networks, as manual labeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we introduce a weakly-supervised age-tracing strategy for model fine-tuning. This approach exploits the similarity in appearance and land-use patterns between historical maps from neighboring time periods to guide the training process. Specifically, model predictions for one map are utilized as pseudo-labels for training on maps from adjacent time periods. Experiments conducted on our newly curated \textit{Hameln} dataset demonstrate that the proposed age-tracing strategy significantly enhances segmentation performance compared to baseline models. In the best-case scenario, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) achieved 77.3\%, reflecting an improvement of approximately 20\% over baseline methods. Additionally, the fine-tuned model achieved an average overall accuracy of 97\%, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach for digitizing historical maps.</p></details> |  | None |

For the performance breakthrough of CIL, it is essential yet challenging to effectively refine past knowledge from the base model and balance it with new learning. However, such a challenge has not been considered in current research. This work proposes a balanced residual distillation learning framework (BRDL) to address this gap and advance CIL performance. BRDL introduces a residual distillation strategy to dynamically refine past knowledge by expanding the network structure and a balanced pseudo-label learning strategy to mitigate class bias and balance learning between old and new classes. We apply the proposed BRDL to a challenging 3D point cloud semantic segmentation task where the data is unordered and unstructured. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BRDL sets a new benchmark with an outstanding balance capability in class-biased scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FGAseg: Fine-Grained Pixel-Text Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00877v2)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to identify and segment specific regions and objects based on text-based descriptions. A common solution is to leverage powerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between vision and text information. However, VLMs are typically pretrained for image-level vision-text alignment, focusing on global semantic features. In contrast, segmentation tasks require fine-grained pixel-level alignment and detailed category boundary information, which VLMs alone cannot provide. As a result, information extracted directly from VLMs can't meet the requirements of segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose FGAseg, a model designed for fine-grained pixel-text alignment and category boundary supplementation. The core of FGAseg is a Pixel-Level Alignment module that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism and a text-pixel alignment loss to refine the coarse-grained alignment from CLIP, achieving finer-grained pixel-text semantic alignment. Additionally, to enrich category boundary information, we introduce the alignment matrices as optimizable pseudo-masks during forward propagation and propose Category Information Supplementation module. These pseudo-masks, derived from cosine and convolutional similarity, provide essential global and local boundary information between different categories. By combining these two strategies, FGAseg effectively enhances pixel-level alignment and category boundary information, addressing key challenges in open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FGAseg outperforms existing methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, RGB-D segmentation-leveraging both visual and depth cues-has attracted increasing attention as it promises richer scene understanding than RGB-only methods. However, most existing efforts have primarily focused on semantic segmentation and thus leave a critical gap. There is a relative scarcity of instance-level RGB-D segmentation datasets, which restricts current methods to broad category distinctions rather than fully capturing the fine-grained details required for recognizing individual objects. To bridge this gap, we introduce three RGB-D instance segmentation benchmarks, distinguished at the instance level. These datasets are versatile, supporting a wide range of applications from indoor navigation to robotic manipulation. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of various baseline models on these benchmarks. This comprehensive analysis identifies both their strengths and shortcomings, guiding future work toward more robust, generalizable solutions. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective method for RGB-D data integration. Extensive evaluations affirm the effectiveness of our approach, offering a robust framework for advancing toward more nuanced scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, energy-based loss realizes the potential of generative modeling on the downstream SS segmentation task.

Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

Vision-based deep learning models can deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for devices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output encoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from two points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and z directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to be fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in 3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for segmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single end-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and force estimation.

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video.

However, existing methods mostly lift knowledge from large 2D vision models into 3DGS on a scene-by-scene basis, restricting the capabilities of open-vocabulary querying within their training scenes so that lacking the generalizability to novel scenes. In this work, we propose \textbf{OVGaussian}, a generalizable \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary 3D semantic segmentation framework based on the 3D \textbf{Gaussian} representation. We first construct a large-scale 3D scene dataset based on 3DGS, dubbed \textbf{SegGaussian}, which provides detailed semantic and instance annotations for both Gaussian points and multi-view images. To promote semantic generalization across scenes, we introduce Generalizable Semantic Rasterization (GSR), which leverages a 3D neural network to learn and predict the semantic property for each 3D Gaussian point, where the semantic property can be rendered as multi-view consistent 2D semantic maps. In the next, we propose a Cross-modal Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that utilizes open-vocabulary annotations of 2D images and 3D Gaussians within SegGaussian to train the 3D neural network capable of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation across Gaussian-based 3D scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that OVGaussian significantly outperforms baseline methods, exhibiting robust cross-scene, cross-domain, and novel-view generalization capabilities.

Then, we propose a procedural prompt generation method based on LLM, which can enrich scenario descriptions and help SD automatically generate more diverse, detailed images. In addition, we introduce a balanced generation strategy, which encourages the SD to generate high-quality objects of tailed classes under various weather conditions, such as riders and motorcycles. This segmentation-model-agnostic method can improve the generalization ability of existing models by additionally adapting them with the generated synthetic data. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method can significantly improve the segmentation performance of different state-of-the-art models on target domains.

To avoid the expensive and laborious acquisition of pixel-level annotations, a wide range of studies attempt to adopt the class activation map (CAM), a weakly-supervised learning scheme, to achieve pixel-level tissue segmentation. However, CAM-based methods are prone to suffer from under-activation and over-activation issues, leading to poor segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel weakly-supervised semantic segmentation framework for histopathological images based on image-mixing synthesis and consistency regularization, dubbed HisynSeg. Specifically, synthesized histopathological images with pixel-level masks are generated for fully-supervised model training, where two synthesis strategies are proposed based on Mosaic transformation and B\'ezier mask generation. Besides, an image filtering module is developed to guarantee the authenticity of the synthesized images. In order to further avoid the model overfitting to the occasional synthesis artifacts, we additionally propose a novel self-supervised consistency regularization, which enables the real images without segmentation masks to supervise the training of the segmentation model. By integrating the proposed techniques, the HisynSeg framework successfully transforms the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation problem into a fully-supervised one, greatly improving the segmentation accuracy.

Although previous research has acknowledged the benefit of 3D data on camera-based scene perception, no specific study has explored the influence of 3D data on image and video panoptic segmentation (VPS).This work seeks to introduce a feature fusion module that enhances PS and VPS by fusing LiDAR and image data for autonomous vehicles. We also illustrate that, in addition to this fusion, our proposed model, which utilizes two simple modifications, can further deliver even more high-quality VPS without being trained on video data. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both the image and video panoptic segmentation evaluation metrics by up to 5 points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> | None |

For example, this information can be used to perform segmentation or single-view depth estimation even though the networks were only trained for image recognition. We show that a similar phenomenon occurs when explicitly training transformers for semantic segmentation in a supervised manner for a set of categories: Once trained, they provide valuable information even about categories absent from the training set. This information can be used to segment objects from these never-seen-before classes in domains as varied as road obstacles, aircraft parked at a terminal, lunar rocks, and maritime hazards.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image Augmentation Agent for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20439v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has achieved remarkable progress using only image-level labels. However, most existing WSSS methods focus on designing new network structures and loss functions to generate more accurate dense labels, overlooking the limitations imposed by fixed datasets, which can constrain performance improvements. We argue that more diverse trainable images provides WSSS richer information and help model understand more comprehensive semantic pattern. Therefore in this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Image Augmentation Agent (IAA) which shows that it is possible to enhance WSSS from data generation perspective. IAA mainly design an augmentation agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to automatically generate additional images for WSSS. In practice, to address the instability in prompt generation by LLMs, we develop a prompt self-refinement mechanism. It allow LLMs to re-evaluate the rationality of generated prompts to produce more coherent prompts. Additionally, we insert an online filter into diffusion generation process to dynamically ensure the quality and balance of generated images. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art WSSS approaches on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many previous state-of-the-art methods either have to discard intricate local semantic features or suffer from high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new Few-shot Semantic Segmentation framework based on the transformer architecture. Our approach introduces the spatial transformer decoder and the contextual mask generation module to improve the relational understanding between support and query images. Moreover, we introduce a multi-scale decoder to refine the segmentation mask by incorporating features from different resolutions in a hierarchical manner. Additionally, our approach integrates global features from intermediate encoder stages to improve contextual understanding, while maintaining a lightweight structure to reduce complexity. This balance between performance and efficiency enables our method to achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as $PASCAL-5^i$ and $COCO-20^i$ in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Notably, our model with only 1.5 million parameters demonstrates competitive performance while overcoming limitations of existing methodologies. https://github.com/amirrezafateh/MSDNet</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/amirrezafateh/MSDNet) |

Existing methods attempt to optimize input text prompts for improved alignment of images and text, by finely adjusting text prototypes to facilitate semantic matching. Nevertheless, given the modality gap between text and vision spaces, the text prototypes employed by these methods have not effectively established a close correspondence with pixel-level vision features. In this work, our theoretical analysis indicates that the inherent modality gap results in misalignment of text and region features, and that this gap cannot be sufficiently reduced by minimizing contrast loss in CLIP. To mitigate the impact of the modality gap, we propose a Vision Prototype Learning (VPL) framework, by introducing more representative vision prototypes. The core of this framework is to learn class-specific vision prototypes in vision space with the help of text prototypes, for capturing high-quality localization maps. Moreover, we propose a regional semantic contrast module that contrasts regions embedding with corresponding prototypes, leading to more comprehensive and robust feature learning. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

The novelty of this work stems from aiming to address the task of maintaining an intuitive and multi-resolution scene representation, while simultaneously offering a tractable foundation for planning and scene understanding during an ongoing inspection mission of apriori unknown targets-of-interest in an unknown environment. The proposed LSG scheme is composed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of abstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the integrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic segmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic elements within the hierarchical representation. This extends the capability of the inspection planner, which can then leverage LSG to make an informed decision to inspect a particular semantic of interest. We also emphasize the hierarchical and semantic path-planning capabilities of LSG, which can extend inspection missions by improving situational awareness for human operators in an unknown environment. The validity of the proposed scheme is proven through extensive evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulations, as well as experimental field deployments on a Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot in urban outdoor environment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19492v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning based methods have revolutionized remote sensing image segmentation. However, these methods usually rely on a pre-defined semantic class set, thus needing additional image annotation and model training when adapting to new classes. More importantly, they are unable to segment arbitrary semantic classes. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation (OVRSISS), which aims to segment arbitrary semantic classes in remote sensing images. To address the lack of OVRSISS datasets, we develop LandDiscover50K, a comprehensive dataset of 51,846 images covering 40 diverse semantic classes. In addition, we propose a novel framework named GSNet that integrates domain priors from special remote sensing models and versatile capabilities of general vision-language models. Technically, GSNet consists of a Dual-Stream Image Encoder (DSIE), a Query-Guided Feature Fusion (QGFF), and a Residual Information Preservation Decoder (RIPD). DSIE first captures comprehensive features from both special models and general models in dual streams. Then, with the guidance of variable vocabularies, QGFF integrates specialist and generalist features, enabling them to complement each other. Finally, RIPD is proposed to aggregate multi-source features for more accurate mask predictions. Experiments show that our method outperforms other methods by a large margin, and our proposed LandDiscover50K improves the performance of OVRSISS methods. The proposed dataset and method will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yecy749/GSNet.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/yecy749/GSNet) |

To overcome this limitation, we focus on the cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) task, aiming to develop a generalized model capable of adapting to a broader range of medical image segmentation scenarios with limited labeled data from the novel target domain. Inspired by the characteristics of frequency domain similarity across different domains, we propose a Frequency-aware Matching Network (FAMNet), which includes two key components: a Frequency-aware Matching (FAM) module and a Multi-Spectral Fusion (MSF) module. The FAM module tackles two problems during the meta-learning phase: 1) intra-domain variance caused by the inherent support-query bias, due to the different appearances of organs and lesions, and 2) inter-domain variance caused by different medical imaging techniques. Additionally, we design an MSF module to integrate the different frequency features decoupled by the FAM module, and further mitigate the impact of inter-domain variance on the model's segmentation performance. Combining these two modules, our FAMNet surpasses existing FSMIS models and Cross-domain Few-shot Semantic Segmentation models on three cross-domain datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the CD-FSMIS task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, persistent challenges, including redundant computation and the reliability of the feature propagation process, underscore the need for further innovation. In response, we present Deep Common Feature Mining (DCFM), a novel approach strategically designed to address these challenges by leveraging the concept of feature sharing. DCFM explicitly decomposes features into two complementary components. The common representation extracted from a key-frame furnishes essential high-level information to neighboring non-key frames, allowing for direct re-utilization without feature propagation. Simultaneously, the independent feature, derived from each video frame, captures rapidly changing information, providing frame-specific clues crucial for segmentation. To achieve such decomposition, we employ a symmetric training strategy tailored for sparsely annotated data, empowering the backbone to learn a robust high-level representation enriched with common information. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised loss function to reinforce intra-class feature similarity and enhance temporal consistency. Experimental evaluations on the VSPW and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency.

However, the deployment of such models has been limited due to the expensive nature of dense data annotation, giving rise to unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). A key challenge in panoptic UDA is reducing the domain gap between a labeled source and an unlabeled target domain while harmonizing the subtasks of semantic and instance segmentation to limit catastrophic interference. While considerable progress has been achieved, existing approaches mainly focus on the adaptation of semantic segmentation. In this work, we focus on incorporating instance-level adaptation via a novel instance-aware cross-domain mixing strategy IMix. IMix significantly enhances the panoptic quality by improving instance segmentation performance. Specifically, we propose inserting high-confidence predicted instances from the target domain onto source images, retaining the exhaustiveness of the resulting pseudo-labels while reducing the injected confirmation bias. Nevertheless, such an enhancement comes at the cost of degraded semantic performance, attributed to catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate this issue, we regularize our semantic branch by employing CLIP-based domain alignment (CDA), exploiting the domain-robustness of natural language prompts. Finally, we present an end-to-end model incorporating these two mechanisms called LIDAPS, achieving state-of-the-art results on all popular panoptic UDA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> | None |

While CNNs excel at extracting multi-scale features and ViTs effectively capture global dependencies, both suffer from high computational costs, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have attracted attention due to their efficiency. However, their performance in image classification tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, this paper introduces VisionGRU, a novel RNN-based architecture designed for efficient image classification. VisionGRU leverages a simplified Gated Recurrent Unit (minGRU) to process large-scale image features with linear complexity. It divides images into smaller patches and progressively reduces the sequence length while increasing the channel depth, thus facilitating multi-scale feature extraction. A hierarchical 2DGRU module with bidirectional scanning captures both local and global contexts, improving long-range dependency modeling, particularly for tasks like semantic segmentation. Experimental results on the ImageNet and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that VisionGRU outperforms ViTs, significantly reducing memory usage and computational costs, especially for high-resolution images. These findings underscore the potential of RNN-based approaches for developing efficient and scalable computer vision solutions.

However, for visually intensive tasks such as few-shot semantic segmentation, pixel-level annotations are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the more challenging image-level annotations and propose an adaptive frequency-aware network (AFANet) for weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS). Specifically, we first propose a cross-granularity frequency-aware module (CFM) that decouples RGB images into high-frequency and low-frequency distributions and further optimizes semantic structural information by realigning them. Unlike most existing WFSS methods using the textual information from the multi-modal language-vision model, e.g., CLIP, in an offline learning manner, we further propose a CLIP-guided spatial-adapter module (CSM), which performs spatial domain adaptive transformation on textual information through online learning, thus providing enriched cross-modal semantic information for CFM. Extensive experiments on the Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and COCO-20\textsuperscript{i} datasets demonstrate that AFANet has achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Due to concerns over geographic information security, data privacy, storage bottleneck and industry competition, high-quality annotated remote sensing images are often isolated and distributed across institutions. The issue of remote sensing data islands poses challenges for fully utilizing isolated datasets to train a global model. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed collaborative learning technology, offers a potential solution to leverage isolated remote sensing data. Typically, remote sensing images from different institutions exhibit significant geographic heterogeneity, characterized by coupled class-distribution heterogeneity and object-appearance heterogeneity. However, existing FL methods lack consideration of them, leading to a decline in the performance of the global model when FL is directly applied to RSS. We propose a novel Geographic heterogeneity-aware Federated learning (GeoFed) framework to bridge data islands in RSS. Our framework consists of three modules, including the Global Insight Enhancement (GIE) module, the Essential Feature Mining (EFM) module and the Local-Global Balance (LoGo) module. Through the GIE module, class distribution heterogeneity is alleviated by introducing a prior global class distribution vector. We design an EFM module to alleviate object appearance heterogeneity by constructing essential features. Furthermore, the LoGo module enables the model to possess both global generalization capability and local adaptation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., FedFBP, FedCASID, FedInria) demonstrate that our GeoFed framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages,12 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

However, their effectiveness in large-scale outdoor datasets remains constrained by the scarcity of accurate supervision signals, the extensive noise caused by variable outdoor conditions, and the abundance of unknown objects. In this work, we propose a novel label-free learning method, Adaptive Label Correction (AdaCo), for 3D semantic segmentation. AdaCo first introduces the Cross-modal Label Generation Module (CLGM), providing cross-modal supervision with the formidable interpretive capabilities of the VFMs. Subsequently, AdaCo incorporates the Adaptive Noise Corrector (ANC), updating and adjusting the noisy samples within this supervision iteratively during training. Moreover, we develop an Adaptive Robust Loss (ARL) function to modulate each sample's sensitivity to noisy supervision, preventing potential underfitting issues associated with robust loss. Our proposed AdaCo can effectively mitigate the performance limitations of label-free learning networks in 3D semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments on two outdoor benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | 2025 AAAI | None |

UniPLV employs the image modal as a bridge to co-embed 3D points with pre-aligned images and text in a shared feature space without requiring carefully crafted point cloud text pairs. To accomplish multi-modal alignment, we propose two key strategies:(i) logit and feature distillation modules between images and point clouds, and (ii) a vison-point matching module is given to explicitly correct the misalignment caused by points to pixels projection. To further improve the performance of our unified framework, we adopt four task-specific losses and a two-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 15.6% and 14.8% for semantic segmentation over Base-Annotated and Annotation-Free tasks, respectively.

Specifically, we first design the semantic backpropagation update (SBU) strategy to fully exploit the knowledge from uncertain pixel regions, enabling the model to learn consistent pixel-level semantic information from those areas. Furthermore, we propose the class-aware knowledge regulation (CKR) module to facilitate the regulation of class-level semantic features across different augmented views, promoting consistent learning of class-level semantic information within the encoder.

Most existing works primarily focus on rendering 2D feature maps from novel viewpoints, which leads to an imprecise 3D language field with outlier languages, ultimately failing to align objects in 3D space. By utilizing masked images for feature extraction, these approaches also lack essential contextual information, leading to inaccurate feature representation. To this end, we propose a Language-Embedded Surface Field (LangSurf), which accurately aligns the 3D language fields with the surface of objects, facilitating precise 2D and 3D segmentation with text query, widely expanding the downstream tasks such as removal and editing. The core of LangSurf is a joint training strategy that flattens the language Gaussian on the object surfaces using geometry supervision and contrastive losses to assign accurate language features to the Gaussians of objects. In addition, we also introduce the Hierarchical-Context Awareness Module to extract features at the image level for contextual information then perform hierarchical mask pooling using masks segmented by SAM to obtain fine-grained language features in different hierarchies. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 2D and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that LangSurf outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LangSplat by a large margin. As shown in Fig. 1, our method is capable of segmenting objects in 3D space, thus boosting the effectiveness of our approach in instance recognition, removal, and editing, which is also supported by comprehensive experiments. \url{https://langsurf.github.io}.</p></details> | <details><summary>\url{...</summary><p>\url{https://langsurf.github.io}</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods, involving simple transformations such as rotations and flips, create new images but often lack diversity along key semantic dimensions and fail to alter high-level semantic properties. To address this issue, generative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by generating synthetic images. Controllable Generative models offer data augmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and visual references from the original image. However, these models face challenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content and structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective prompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using \textit{Class-Prompt Appending} and \textit{Visual Prior Blending} to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise number of augmented images while preserving the structure of segmentation-labeled classes. In addition, we implement a \textit{class balancing algorithm} to ensure a balanced training dataset when merging the synthetic and original images.

In this task with prospective potential, the egocentric scenes contain dense wearer-object relations and inter-object interference. However, most recent third-view methods leverage the frozen Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, which is pre-trained on the semantic-oriented third-view data and lapses in the egocentric view due to the ``relation insensitive" problem. Hence, we propose a Cognition Transferring and Decoupling Network (CTDN) that first learns the egocentric wearer-object relations via correlating the image and text. Besides, a Cognition Transferring Module (CTM) is developed to distill the cognitive knowledge from the large-scale pre-trained model to our model for recognizing egocentric objects with various semantics. Based on the transferred cognition, the Foreground-background Decoupling Module (FDM) disentangles the visual representations to explicitly discriminate the foreground and background regions to mitigate false activation areas caused by foreground-background interferential objects during egocentric relation learning.

However, these segmentation models are trained on a closed and predefined set of semantic classes, which leads to significant prediction failures in open-world scenarios on unknown objects. As this behavior prevents the application in safety-critical applications such as automated driving, the detection and segmentation of these objects from outside their predefined semantic space (out-of-distribution (OOD) objects) is of the utmost importance. In this work, we present a multi-scale OOD segmentation method that exploits the confidence information of a foreground-background segmentation model. While semantic segmentation models are trained on specific classes, this restriction does not apply to foreground-background methods making them suitable for OOD segmentation. We consider the per pixel confidence score of the model prediction which is close to 1 for a pixel in a foreground object. By aggregating these confidence values for different sized patches, objects of various sizes can be identified in a single image. Our experiments show improved performance of our method in OOD segmentation compared to comparable baselines in the SegmentMeIfYouCan benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Detect Changes like Humans: Incorporating Semantic Priors for Improved Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16918v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When given two similar images, humans identify their differences by comparing the appearance ({\it e.g., color, texture}) with the help of semantics ({\it e.g., objects, relations}). However, mainstream change detection models adopt a supervised training paradigm, where the annotated binary change map is the main constraint. Thus, these methods primarily emphasize the difference-aware features between bi-temporal images and neglect the semantic understanding of the changed landscapes, which undermines the accuracy in the presence of noise and illumination variations. To this end, this paper explores incorporating semantic priors to improve the ability to detect changes. Firstly, we propose a Semantic-Aware Change Detection network, namely SA-CDNet, which transfers the common knowledge of the visual foundation models ({\it i.e., FastSAM}) to change detection. Inspired by the human visual paradigm, a novel dual-stream feature decoder is derived to distinguish changes by combining semantic-aware features and difference-aware features. Secondly, we design a single-temporal semantic pre-training strategy to enhance the semantic understanding of landscapes, which brings further increments. Specifically, we construct pseudo-change detection data from public single-temporal remote sensing segmentation datasets for large-scale pre-training, where an extra branch is also introduced for the proxy semantic segmentation task. Experimental results on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, the existing approaches require a large number of finely annotated segmentation samples in the training stage. To alleviate this issue, we propose a composite oil spill detection framework, SAM-OIL, comprising an object detector (e.g., YOLOv8), an Adapted Segment Anything Model (SAM), and an Ordered Mask Fusion (OMF) module. SAM-OIL is the first application of the powerful SAM in oil spill detection. Specifically, the SAM-OIL strategy uses YOLOv8 to obtain the categories and bounding boxes of oil spill-related objects, then inputs bounding boxes into the Adapted SAM to retrieve category-agnostic masks, and finally adopts the OMF module to fuse the masks and categories. The Adapted SAM, combining a frozen SAM with a learnable Adapter module, can enhance SAM's ability to segment ambiguous objects. The OMF module, a parameter-free method, can effectively resolve pixel category conflicts within SAM.

| **[MAGIC++: Efficient and Resilient Modality-Agnostic Semantic Segmentation via Hierarchical Modality Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16876v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the challenging modality-agnostic semantic segmentation (MaSS), aiming at centering the value of every modality at every feature granularity. Training with all available visual modalities and effectively fusing an arbitrary combination of them is essential for robust multi-modal fusion in semantic segmentation, especially in real-world scenarios, yet remains less explored to date. Existing approaches often place RGB at the center, treating other modalities as secondary, resulting in an asymmetric architecture. However, RGB alone can be limiting in scenarios like nighttime, where modalities such as event data excel. Therefore, a resilient fusion model must dynamically adapt to each modality's strengths while compensating for weaker inputs.To this end, we introduce the MAGIC++ framework, which comprises two key plug-and-play modules for effective multi-modal fusion and hierarchical modality selection that can be equipped with various backbone models. Firstly, we introduce a multi-modal interaction module to efficiently process features from the input multi-modal batches and extract complementary scene information with channel-wise and spatial-wise guidance. On top, a unified multi-scale arbitrary-modal selection module is proposed to utilize the aggregated features as the benchmark to rank the multi-modal features based on the similarity scores at hierarchical feature spaces. This way, our method can eliminate the dependence on RGB modality at every feature granularity and better overcome sensor failures and environmental noises while ensuring the segmentation performance. Under the common multi-modal setting, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both real-world and synthetic benchmarks. Moreover, our method is superior in the novel modality-agnostic setting, where it outperforms prior arts by a large margin.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adversarial Diffusion Model for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16859v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation requires labour-intensive labelling tasks to obtain the supervision signals, and because of this issue, it is encouraged that using domain adaptation, which transfers information from the existing labelled source domains to unlabelled or weakly labelled target domains, is essential. However, it is intractable to find a well-generalised representation which can describe two domains due to probabilistic or geometric difference between the two domains. This paper presents a novel method, the Conditional and Inter-coder Connected Latent Diffusion (CICLD) based Semantic Segmentation Model, to advance unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation tasks. Leveraging the strengths of latent diffusion models and adversarial learning, our method effectively bridges the gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. CICLD incorporates a conditioning mechanism to improve contextual understanding during segmentation and an inter-coder connection to preserve fine-grained details and spatial hierarchies. Additionally, adversarial learning aligns latent feature distributions across source, mixed, and target domains, further enhancing generalisation. Extensive experiments are conducted across three benchmark datasets-GTA5, Synthia, and Cityscape-shows that CICLD outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods. Notably, the proposed method achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 74.4 for the GTA5 to Cityscape UDA setting and 67.2 mIoU for the Synthia to Cityscape UDA setting.

| **[A Novel Approach to Tomato Harvesting Using a Hybrid Gripper with Semantic Segmentation and Keypoint Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16755v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current agriculture and farming industries are able to reap advancements in robotics and automation technology to harvest fruits and vegetables using robots with adaptive grasping forces based on the compliance or softness of the fruit or vegetable. A successful operation depends on using a gripper that can adapt to the mechanical properties of the crops. This paper proposes a new robotic harvesting approach for tomato fruit using a novel hybrid gripper with a soft caging effect. It uses its six flexible passive auxetic structures based on fingers with rigid outer exoskeletons for good gripping strength and shape conformability. The gripper is actuated through a scotch-yoke mechanism using a servo motor. To perform tomato picking operations through a gripper, a vision system based on a depth camera and RGB camera implements the fruit identification process. It incorporates deep learning-based keypoint detection of the tomato's pedicel and body for localization in an occluded and variable ambient light environment and semantic segmentation of ripe and unripe tomatoes. In addition, robust trajectory planning of the robotic arm based on input from the vision system and control of robotic gripper movements are carried out for secure tomato handling. The tunable grasping force of the gripper would allow the robotic handling of fruits with a broad range of compliance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IV-tuning: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Infrared-Visible Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16654v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared-visible (IR-VIS) tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, greatly benefit from the advantage of combining infrared and visible modalities. To inherit the general representations of the Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), task-specific dual-branch networks are designed and fully fine-tuned on downstream datasets. Although effective, this manner lacks generality and is sub-optimal due to the scarcity of downstream infrared-visible datasets and limited transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel and general fine-tuning approach, namely "IV-tuning", to parameter-efficiently harness VFMs for various infrared-visible downstream tasks. At its core, IV-tuning freezes pre-trained visible-based VFMs and integrates modal-specific prompts with adapters within the backbone, bridging the gap between VFMs and downstream infrared-visible tasks while simultaneously learning the complementarity between different modalities. By fine-tuning approximately 3% of the backbone parameters, IV-tuning outperforms full fine-tuning across various baselines in infrared-visible semantic segmentation and object detection, as well as previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that IV-tuning achieves superior performance with fewer training parameters, providing a good alternative to full fine-tuning and a novel method of extending visible-based models for infrared-visible tasks.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limits the scalability of these systems and their deployment on resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a solution by introducing a linear recurrence mechanism, which reduces the complexity of sequence modeling from quadratic to linear. Recently, SSMs have been extended to high-resolution vision tasks. Nonetheless, the linear recurrence mechanism struggles to fully utilize matrix multiplication units on modern hardware, resulting in a computational bottleneck. We address this issue by introducing \textit{VMeanba}, a training-free compression method that eliminates the channel dimension in SSMs using mean operations. Our key observation is that the output activations of SSM blocks exhibit low variances across channels. Our \textit{VMeanba} leverages this property to optimize computation by averaging activation maps across the channel to reduce the computational overhead without compromising accuracy. Evaluations on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that \textit{VMeanba} achieves up to a 1.12x speedup with less than a 3\% accuracy loss. When combined with 40\% unstructured pruning, the accuracy drop remains under 3\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Machine Learning for Systems workshop</p></details> | None |

Our experimental results demonstrate the impact of our dataset in improving performance across several alignment metrics, addressing key challenges in domain adaptation and generalization for segmentation tasks. This research also explores critical aspects of synthetic data generation, such as optimizing the balance between the volume and variability of generated images to enhance segmentation performance.

However, unlike vision-language models such as CLIP, self-supervised visual features are not readily aligned with language, hindering their adoption in open-vocabulary tasks. Our method, named dino.txt, unlocks this new ability for DINOv2, a widely used self-supervised visual encoder. We build upon the LiT training strategy, which trains a text encoder to align with a frozen vision model but leads to unsatisfactory results on dense tasks. We propose several key ingredients to improve performance on both global and dense tasks, such as concatenating the [CLS] token with the patch average to train the alignment and curating data using both text and image modalities. With these, we successfully train a CLIP-like model with only a fraction of the computational cost compared to CLIP while achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot classification and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, navigating the colon for thorough polyp detection poses significant challenges. To advance camera navigation in colonoscopy, we propose the Semantic Segmentation for Tools and Fold Edges in Colonoscopy (SegCol) Challenge. This challenge introduces a dataset from the EndoMapper repository, featuring manually annotated, pixel-level semantic labels for colon folds and endoscopic tools across selected frames from 96 colonoscopy videos. By providing fold edges as anatomical landmarks and depth discontinuity information from both fold and tool labels, the dataset is aimed to improve depth perception and localization methods.

| **[Search-based DNN Testing and Retraining with GAN-enhanced Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13359v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles and robots), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are becoming a key component for computer vision tasks, particularly semantic segmentation. Further, since the DNN behavior cannot be assessed through code inspection and analysis, test automation has become an essential activity to gain confidence in the reliability of DNNs. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art automated testing solutions largely rely on simulators, whose fidelity is always imperfect, thus affecting the validity of test results. To address such limitations, we propose to combine meta-heuristic search, used to explore the input space using simulators, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to transform the data generated by simulators into realistic input images. Such images can be used both to assess the DNN performance and to retrain the DNN more effectively. We applied our approach to a state-of-the-art DNN performing semantic segmentation and demonstrated that it outperforms a state-of-the-art GAN-based testing solution and several baselines. Specifically, it leads to the largest number of diverse images leading to the worst DNN performance. Further, the images generated with our approach, lead to the highest improvement in DNN performance when used for retraining. In conclusion, we suggest to always integrate GAN components when performing search-driven, simulator-based testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

Representative GFSS approaches typically employ a two-phase training scheme, involving base class pre-training followed by novel class fine-tuning, to learn the classifiers for base and novel classes respectively. Nevertheless, distribution gap exists between base and novel classes in this process. To narrow this gap, we exploit effective knowledge transfer from base to novel classes. First, a novel prototype modulation module is designed to modulate novel class prototypes by exploiting the correlations between base and novel classes. Second, a novel classifier calibration module is proposed to calibrate the weight distribution of the novel classifier according to that of the base classifier. Furthermore, existing GFSS approaches suffer from a lack of contextual information for novel classes due to their limited samples, we thereby introduce a context consistency learning scheme to transfer the contextual knowledge from base to novel classes. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the state of the art in the GFSS setting.

Machine learning (ML) methods for automatically extracting field boundaries from remotely sensed images could help realize the demand for these datasets at a global scale. However, current ML methods for field instance segmentation lack sufficient geographic coverage, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. Further, research on improving ML methods is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets representing the diversity of global agricultural fields. We present Fields of The World (FTW) -- a novel ML benchmark dataset for agricultural field instance segmentation spanning 24 countries on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America). FTW is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets with 70,462 samples, each containing instance and semantic segmentation masks paired with multi-date, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. We provide results from baseline models for the new FTW benchmark, show that models trained on FTW have better zero-shot and fine-tuning performance in held-out countries than models that aren't pre-trained with diverse datasets, and show positive qualitative zero-shot results of FTW models in a real-world scenario -- running on Sentinel-2 scenes over Ethiopia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI-2025 Artificial Intelligence for Social Impact (AISI) track</p></details> | None |

This fact also limits the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research in this field. To address this gap, GIRAFE is a data repository designed to facilitate the development of advanced techniques for the semantic segmentation, analysis, and fast evaluation of High-Speed videoendoscopic sequences of the vocal folds. The repository includes 65 high-speed videoendoscopic recordings from a cohort of 50 patients (30 female, 20 male). The dataset comprises 15 recordings from healthy controls, 26 from patients with diagnosed voice disorders, and 24 with an unknown health condition. All of them were manually annotated by an expert, including the masks corresponding to the semantic segmentation of the glottal gap. The repository is also complemented with the automatic segmentation of the glottal area using different state-of-the-art approaches. This data set has already supported several studies, which demonstrates its usefulness for the development of new glottal gap segmentation algorithms from High-Speed-Videoendoscopic sequences to improve or create new Facilitative Playbacks. Despite these advances and others in the field, the broader challenge of performing an accurate and completely automatic semantic segmentation method of the glottal area remains open.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures | None |

However, few works discuss the inhomogeneity of sparse annotations, albeit it is common in real-world scenarios. Therefore, this work introduces the probability density function into the gradient sampling approximation method to qualitatively analyze the impact of annotation sparsity and inhomogeneity under weakly supervised learning. Based on our analysis, we propose an Adaptive Annotation Distribution Network (AADNet) capable of robust learning on arbitrarily distributed sparse annotations. Specifically, we propose a label-aware point cloud downsampling strategy to increase the proportion of annotations involved in the training stage. Furthermore, we design the multiplicative dynamic entropy as the gradient calibration function to mitigate the gradient bias caused by non-uniformly distributed sparse annotations and explicitly reduce the epistemic uncertainty. Without any prior restrictions and additional information, our proposed method achieves comprehensive performance improvements at multiple label rates and different annotation distributions.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper challenges the prevailing notion that multiview fusion is essential for achieving high performance. We demonstrate that significant gains can be realized by directly fusing Polar and Cartesian partitioning strategies within the BEV space. Our proposed BEV-only segmentation model leverages the inherent fixed grid correspondences between these partitioning schemes, enabling a fusion process that is orders of magnitude faster (170$\times$ speedup) than conventional point-based methods. Furthermore, our approach facilitates dense feature fusion, preserving richer contextual information compared to sparse point-based alternatives. To enhance scene understanding while maintaining inference efficiency, we also introduce a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture. Extensive evaluation on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets provides compelling evidence that our method outperforms previous multiview fusion approaches in terms of both performance and inference speed, highlighting the potential of BEV-based fusion for LiDAR segmentation.

Semantic segmentation is essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles and smart city infrastructure, but faces significant latency challenges due to high computational and communication loads. Traditional centralized processing methods are inefficient for such scenarios, often resulting in unacceptable inference delays. SL offers a promising alternative by partitioning deep neural networks (DNNs) between edge devices and a central server, enabling localized data processing and reducing the amount of data required for transmission. Our contribution includes the joint optimization of bandwidth allocation, cut layer selection of the edge devices' DNN, and the central server's processing resource allocation. We investigate both parallel and serial data processing scenarios and propose low-complexity heuristic solutions that maintain near-optimal performance while reducing computational requirements. Numerical results show that our approach effectively reduces inference delay, demonstrating the potential of SL for improving real-time CV applications in dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Visual Tokenization, trained by self-supervised reconstructive learning, compresses visual data by codebook in patch-level with marginal information loss, but the visual tokens does not have semantic meaning. Open Vocabulary semantic segmentation benefits from the evolving Vision-Language models (VLMs) with strong image zero-shot capability, but transferring image-level to pixel-level understanding remains an imminent challenge. In this paper, we treat segmentation as tokenizing pixels and study a united perceptual and semantic token compression for all granular understanding and consequently facilitate open vocabulary semantic segmentation. Referring to the cognitive process of pretrained VLM where the low-level features are progressively composed to high-level semantics, we propose Feature Pyramid Tokenization (PAT) to cluster and represent multi-resolution feature by learnable codebooks and then decode them by joint learning pixel reconstruction and semantic segmentation. We design loosely coupled pixel and semantic learning branches. The pixel branch simulates bottom-up composition and top-down visualization of codebook tokens, while the semantic branch collectively fuse hierarchical codebooks as auxiliary segmentation guidance. Our experiments show that PAT enhances the semantic intuition of VLM feature pyramid, improves performance over the baseline segmentation model and achieves competitive performance on open vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmark. Our model is parameter-efficient for VLM integration and flexible for the independent tokenization. We hope to give inspiration not only on improving segmentation but also on semantic visual token utilization.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures | None |

It is traditionally treated using open esophagectomy, but in recent years, robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) has emerged as a promising alternative. However, robot-assisted surgery can be challenging for novice surgeons, as they often suffer from a loss of spatial orientation. Computer-aided anatomy recognition holds promise for improving surgical navigation, but research in this area remains limited. In this study, we developed a comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation in RAMIE, featuring the largest collection of vital anatomical structures and surgical instruments to date. Handling this diverse set of classes presents challenges, including class imbalance and the recognition of complex structures such as nerves. This study aims to understand the challenges and limitations of current state-of-the-art algorithms on this novel dataset and problem. Therefore, we benchmarked eight real-time deep learning models using two pretraining datasets. We assessed both traditional and attention-based networks, hypothesizing that attention-based networks better capture global patterns and address challenges such as occlusion caused by blood or other tissues. The benchmark includes our RAMIE dataset and the publicly available CholecSeg8k dataset, enabling a thorough assessment of surgical segmentation tasks. Our findings indicate that pretraining on ADE20k, a dataset for semantic segmentation, is more effective than pretraining on ImageNet. Furthermore, attention-based models outperform traditional convolutional neural networks, with SegNeXt and Mask2Former achieving higher Dice scores, and Mask2Former additionally excelling in average symmetric surface distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the SPIE Medical Imaging Conference, 2025</p></details> | None |

The previous methods mainly strengthen the inter-class differences to avoid class semantic ambiguity which may lead to erroneous activation. However, they overlook the positive function of some shared information between similar classes. Categories within the same cluster share some similar features. Allowing the model to recognize these features can further relieve the semantic ambiguity between these classes. To effectively identify and utilize this shared information, in this paper, we introduce a novel WSSS framework called Prompt Categories Clustering (PCC). Specifically, we explore the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters through prompts. These clusters effectively represent the intrinsic relationships between categories. By integrating this relational information into the training network, our model is able to better learn the hidden connections between categories. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing its ability to enhance performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and surpass existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.</p></details> |  | None |
