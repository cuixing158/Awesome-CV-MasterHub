However, point clouds from LiDARs used in automated driving are particularly challenging for MAEs since large areas of the 3D volume are empty. Consequently, existing work suffers from leaking occupancy information into the decoder and has significant computational complexity, thereby limiting the SSL pre-training to only 2D bird's eye view encoders in practice. In this work, we propose the novel neighborhood occupancy MAE (NOMAE) that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by employing masked occupancy reconstruction only in the neighborhood of non-masked voxels. We incorporate voxel masking and occupancy reconstruction at multiple scales with our proposed hierarchical mask generation technique to capture features of objects of different sizes in the point cloud. NOMAEs are extremely flexible and can be directly employed for SSL in existing 3D architectures. We perform extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets for the downstream perception tasks of semantic segmentation and 3D object detection, comparing with both discriminative and generative SSL methods. The results demonstrate that NOMAE sets the new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks for multiple point cloud perception tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, recent efforts in ConvNet designs primarily focused on increasing kernel size to obtain a larger receptive field without considering this crucial biomimetic mechanism to further improve performance. To this end, we propose a novel pure ConvNet vision backbone, termed OverLoCK, which is carefully devised from both the architecture and mixer perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a biomimetic Deep-stage Decomposition Strategy (DDS) that fuses semantically meaningful context representations into middle and deep layers by providing dynamic top-down context guidance at both feature and kernel weight levels. To fully unleash the power of top-down context guidance, we further propose a novel \textbf{Cont}ext-\textbf{Mix}ing Dynamic Convolution (ContMix) that effectively models long-range dependencies while preserving inherent local inductive biases even when the input resolution increases. These properties are absent in previous convolutions. With the support from both DDS and ContMix, our OverLoCK exhibits notable performance improvement over existing methods. For instance, OverLoCK-T achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 84.2\%, significantly surpassing ConvNeXt-B while only using around one-third of the FLOPs/parameters. On object detection with Cascade Mask R-CNN, our OverLoCK-S surpasses MogaNet-B by a significant 1\% in AP$^b$. On semantic segmentation with UperNet, our OverLoCK-T remarkably improves UniRepLKNet-T by 1.7\% in mIoU.

| **[SegLocNet: Multimodal Localization Network for Autonomous Driving via Bird's-Eye-View Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20077v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate localization is critical for autonomous driving. Traditional GNSS-based localization methods suffer from signal occlusion and multipath effects in urban environments. Meanwhile, methods relying on high-definition (HD) maps are constrained by the high costs associated with the construction and maintenance of HD maps. Standard-definition (SD) maps-based methods, on the other hand, often exhibit unsatisfactory performance or poor generalization ability due to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SegLocNet, a multimodal GNSS-free localization network that achieves precise localization using bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation. SegLocNet employs a BEV segmentation network to generate semantic maps from multiple sensor inputs, followed by an exhaustive matching process to estimate the vehicle's ego pose. This approach avoids the limitations of regression-based pose estimation and maintains high interpretability and generalization. By introducing a unified map representation, our method can be applied to both HD and SD maps without any modifications to the network architecture, thereby balancing localization accuracy and area coverage. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, and that our method can accurately estimate the ego pose in urban environments without relying on GNSS, while maintaining strong generalization ability. Our code and pre-trained model will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D-AffordanceLLM: Harnessing Large Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Affordance Detection in 3D Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20041v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Affordance detection is a challenging problem with broad applications on various robotic tasks. Existing methods typically formulate the detection paradigm as a label-based semantic segmentation task. This paradigm relies on predefined labels and lacks the ability to comprehend complex natural language, resulting in limited generalization in open-world scene. To address these limitations, we reformulate the traditional affordance detection paradigm into \textit{Instruction Reasoning Affordance Segmentation} (IRAS) task. This task is designed to output a affordance mask region given a query reasoning text, which avoids fixed categories of input labels. We accordingly propose the \textit{3D-AffordanceLLM} (3D-ADLLM), a framework designed for reasoning affordance detection in 3D open-scene. Specifically, 3D-ADLLM introduces large language models (LLMs) to 3D affordance perception with a custom-designed decoder for generating affordance masks, thus achieving open-world reasoning affordance detection. In addition, given the scarcity of 3D affordance datasets for training large models, we seek to extract knowledge from general segmentation data and transfer it to affordance detection. Thus, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that begins with a novel pre-training task, i.e., \textit{Referring Object Part Segmentation}~(ROPS). This stage is designed to equip the model with general recognition and segmentation capabilities at the object-part level. Then followed by fine-tuning with the IRAS task, 3D-ADLLM obtains the reasoning ability for affordance detection. In summary, 3D-ADLLM leverages the rich world knowledge and human-object interaction reasoning ability of LLMs, achieving approximately an 8\% improvement in mIoU on open-vocabulary affordance detection tasks.</p></details> | ICLR | None |
| **[Learning Mask Invariant Mutual Information for Masked Image Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19718v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked autoencoders (MAEs) represent a prominent self-supervised learning paradigm in computer vision. Despite their empirical success, the underlying mechanisms of MAEs remain insufficiently understood. Recent studies have attempted to elucidate the functioning of MAEs through contrastive learning and feature representation analysis, yet these approaches often provide only implicit insights. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for understanding MAEs by leveraging the information bottleneck principle in information theory. Our theoretical analyses reveal that optimizing the latent features to balance relevant and irrelevant information is key to improving MAE performance. Building upon our proofs, we introduce MI-MAE, a novel method that optimizes MAEs through mutual information maximization and minimization. By enhancing latent features to retain maximal relevant information between them and the output, and minimizing irrelevant information between them and the input, our approach achieves better performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that MI-MAE significantly outperforms MAE models in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Our findings validate the theoretical framework and highlight the practical advantages of applying the information bottleneck principle to MAEs, offering deeper insights for developing more powerful self-supervised learning models.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |
| **[RMT: Retentive Networks Meet Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11523v6)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained increasing attention in the computer vision community in recent years. However, the core component of ViT, Self-Attention, lacks explicit spatial priors and bears a quadratic computational complexity, thereby constraining the applicability of ViT. To alleviate these issues, we draw inspiration from the recent Retentive Network (RetNet) in the field of NLP, and propose RMT, a strong vision backbone with explicit spatial prior for general purposes. Specifically, we extend the RetNet's temporal decay mechanism to the spatial domain, and propose a spatial decay matrix based on the Manhattan distance to introduce the explicit spatial prior to Self-Attention. Additionally, an attention decomposition form that adeptly adapts to explicit spatial prior is proposed, aiming to reduce the computational burden of modeling global information without disrupting the spatial decay matrix. Based on the spatial decay matrix and the attention decomposition form, we can flexibly integrate explicit spatial prior into the vision backbone with linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMT exhibits exceptional performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without extra training data, RMT achieves **84.8%** and **86.1%** top-1 acc on ImageNet-1k with **27M/4.5GFLOPs** and **96M/18.2GFLOPs**. For downstream tasks, RMT achieves **54.5** box AP and **47.2** mask AP on the COCO detection task, and **52.8** mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task.

| **[MAMBA4D: Efficient Long-Sequence Point Cloud Video Understanding with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14338v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos can faithfully capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing world. However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up. Codes will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/Mamba4D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

| **[Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Segmentation: A Label Space Unification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19177v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An increasing number of datasets sharing similar domains for semantic segmentation have been published over the past few years. But despite the growing amount of overall data, it is still difficult to train bigger and better models due to inconsistency in taxonomy and/or labeling policies of different datasets. To this end, we propose a knowledge distillation approach that also serves as a label space unification method for semantic segmentation. In short, a teacher model is trained on a source dataset with a given taxonomy, then used to pseudo-label additional data for which ground truth labels of a related label space exist. By mapping the related taxonomies to the source taxonomy, we create constraints within which the model can predict pseudo-labels. Using the improved pseudo-labels we train student models that consistently outperform their teachers in two challenging domains, namely urban and off-road driving. Our ground truth-corrected pseudo-labels span over 12 and 7 public datasets with 388.230 and 18.558 images for the urban and off-road domains, respectively, creating the largest compound datasets for autonomous driving to date.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Potential Field as Scene Affordance for Behavior Change-Based Visual Risk Object Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15846v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study behavior change-based visual risk object identification (Visual-ROI), a critical framework designed to detect potential hazards for intelligent driving systems. Existing methods often show significant limitations in spatial accuracy and temporal consistency, stemming from an incomplete understanding of scene affordance. For example, these methods frequently misidentify vehicles that do not impact the ego vehicle as risk objects. Furthermore, existing behavior change-based methods are inefficient because they implement causal inference in the perspective image space. We propose a new framework with a Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation to overcome the above challenges. Specifically, we utilize potential fields as scene affordance, involving repulsive forces derived from road infrastructure and traffic participants, along with attractive forces sourced from target destinations. In this work, we compute potential fields by assigning different energy levels according to the semantic labels obtained from BEV semantic segmentation. We conduct thorough experiments and ablation studies, comparing the proposed method with various state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show a notable increase in spatial and temporal consistency, with enhancements of 20.3% and 11.6% on the RiskBench dataset, respectively. Additionally, we can improve computational efficiency by 88%. We achieve improvements of 5.4% in spatial accuracy and 7.2% in temporal consistency on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Multimodality Helps Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22489v4)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation (FS-PCS) aims at generalizing models to segment novel categories with minimal annotated support samples. While existing FS-PCS methods have shown promise, they primarily focus on unimodal point cloud inputs, overlooking the potential benefits of leveraging multimodal information. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal FS-PCS setup, utilizing textual labels and the potentially available 2D image modality. Under this easy-to-achieve setup, we present the MultiModal Few-Shot SegNet (MM-FSS), a model effectively harnessing complementary information from multiple modalities. MM-FSS employs a shared backbone with two heads to extract intermodal and unimodal visual features, and a pretrained text encoder to generate text embeddings. To fully exploit the multimodal information, we propose a Multimodal Correlation Fusion (MCF) module to generate multimodal correlations, and a Multimodal Semantic Fusion (MSF) module to refine the correlations using text-aware semantic guidance. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective Test-time Adaptive Cross-modal Calibration (TACC) technique to mitigate training bias, further improving generalization. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements achieved by our method. The efficacy of our approach indicates the benefits of leveraging commonly-ignored free modalities for FS-PCS, providing valuable insights for future research.

| **[Enhanced Neuromorphic Semantic Segmentation Latency through Stream Event](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18982v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving optimal semantic segmentation with frame-based vision sensors poses significant challenges for real-time systems like UAVs and self-driving cars, which require rapid and precise processing. Traditional frame-based methods often struggle to balance latency, accuracy, and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we leverage event streams from event-based cameras-bio-inspired sensors that trigger events in response to changes in the scene. Specifically, we analyze the number of events triggered between successive frames, with a high number indicating significant changes and a low number indicating minimal changes. We exploit this event information to solve the semantic segmentation task by employing a Spiking Neural Network (SNN), a bio-inspired computing paradigm known for its low energy consumption. Our experiments on the DSEC dataset show that our approach significantly reduces latency with only a limited drop in accuracy. Additionally, by using SNNs, we achieve low power consumption, making our method suitable for energy-constrained real-time applications. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to effectively balance reduced latency, minimal accuracy loss, and energy efficiency using events stream to enhance semantic segmentation in dynamic and resource-limited environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have decided to withdraw this paper because I have recently obtained some new data and insights during my ongoing research</p></details> | None |
| **[Sewer Image Super-Resolution with Depth Priors and Its Lightweight Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19271v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Quick-view (QV) technique serves as a primary method for detecting defects within sewerage systems. However, the effectiveness of QV is impeded by the limited visual range of its hardware, resulting in suboptimal image quality for distant portions of the sewer network. Image super-resolution is an effective way to improve image quality and has been applied in a variety of scenes. However, research on super-resolution for sewer images remains considerably unexplored. In response, this study leverages the inherent depth relationships present within QV images and introduces a novel Depth-guided, Reference-based Super-Resolution framework denoted as DSRNet. It comprises two core components: a depth extraction module and a depth information matching module (DMM). DSRNet utilizes the adjacent frames of the low-resolution image as reference images and helps them recover texture information based on the correlation. By combining these modules, the integration of depth priors significantly enhances both visual quality and performance benchmarks. Besides, in pursuit of computational efficiency and compactness, a super-resolution knowledge distillation model based on an attention mechanism is introduced. This mechanism facilitates the acquisition of feature similarity between a more complex teacher model and a streamlined student model, with the latter being a lightweight version of DSRNet. Experimental results demonstrate that DSRNet significantly improves PSNR and SSIM compared with other methods. This study also conducts experiments on sewer defect semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification on the Pipe dataset and Sewer-ML dataset. Experiments show that the method can improve the performance of low-resolution sewer images in these tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[NPSim: Nighttime Photorealistic Simulation From Daytime Images With Monocular Inverse Rendering and Ray Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10720v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is an important task for autonomous driving. A powerful autonomous driving system should be capable of handling images under all conditions, including nighttime. Generating accurate and diverse nighttime semantic segmentation datasets is crucial for enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms in low-light conditions. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach named NPSim, which enables the simulation of realistic nighttime images from real daytime counterparts with monocular inverse rendering and ray tracing. NPSim comprises two key components: mesh reconstruction and relighting. The mesh reconstruction component generates an accurate representation of the scene structure by combining geometric information extracted from the input RGB image and semantic information from its corresponding semantic labels. The relighting component integrates real-world nighttime light sources and material characteristics to simulate the complex interplay of light and object surfaces under low-light conditions. The scope of this thesis mainly focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the mesh reconstruction component. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh reconstruction component in producing high-quality scene meshes and their generality across different autonomous driving datasets. We also propose a detailed experiment plan for evaluating the entire pipeline, including both quantitative metrics in training state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches and human perceptual studies, aiming to indicate the capability of our approach to generate realistic nighttime images and the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, 3D medical vision-language pre-training (MedVLP) remains underexplored due to the lack of a large-scale, publicly available 3D medical image-report dataset. To bridge this gap, we introduce **CT-3DVLP**, the first and largest **public** 3D volume-report dataset, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for 3D MedVLP research. Meanwhile, we propose the **T3D** framework, which enhances 3D MedVLP beyond naive CLIP-style alignment that directly pairs volumes with reports but neglects local visual representations. Instead, we introduce **Text-informed Multi-view Alignment (TMA)**, a novel approach that clusters volumetric data while enforcing consistency across different views of the same volume-report pair. TMA integrates textual features into fine-grained visual representations, ensuring contextual coherence across views. We evaluate T3D across multiple downstream tasks in both unimodal and cross-modal settings, including zero-shot and fine-tuned classification, cross-modal retrieval, report generation, and semantic segmentation. Our results show that T3D consistently outperforms existing vSSL and multimodal methods, demonstrating superior zero-shot and fine-tuning capabilities and setting a new benchmark for 3D medical image understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

To achieve this, we resort to text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images. Our exhaustive evaluation metrics demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles multiple perception tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art models. We achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs. 1B pixel-level annotated images). Inspired by Wang et al., DICEPTION formulates the outputs of various perception tasks using color encoding; and we show that the strategy of assigning random colors to different instances is highly effective in both entity segmentation and semantic segmentation. Unifying various perception tasks as conditional image generation enables us to fully leverage pre-trained text-to-image models. Thus, DICEPTION can be efficiently trained at a cost of orders of magnitude lower, compared to conventional models that were trained from scratch. When adapting our model to other tasks, it only requires fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and 1% of its parameters. DICEPTION provides valuable insights and a more promising solution for visual generalist models.

While existing frameworks such as Auxiliary Modality Learning (AML) effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they primarily operate in a single-agent context. This limitation is particularly critical in dynamic environments, such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. To address these challenges, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning ($\textbf{CAML}$), a novel multi-agent multi-modality framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multimodal data during training while allowing inference with reduced modalities per agent during testing. We systematically analyze the effectiveness of $\textbf{CAML}$ from the perspective of uncertainty reduction and data coverage, providing theoretical insights into its advantages over AML. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that \ours~achieves up to a ${\bf 58.13}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate $\textbf{CAML}$ on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.61}\%$ improvement in mIoU.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous paradigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on ViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the existing paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask Decoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT really need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we investigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the effectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context Replay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the ViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real pyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier mock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality in the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation studies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We conducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that VPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective design. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the long-established mIoU wall/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report, minor fix</p></details> | None |
| **[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling waves of neural activity are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" problem -- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric information -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in artificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating these wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we obtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly outperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models with fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based communication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings suggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits, while simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to biological recordings of neural activity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching for Visual Misinformation Detection Using Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06288v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

However, due to the needs of specific equipment and special application scenarios, the acquisition and annotation of hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often costly and time-consuming. To this end, our work explores the potential of generative diffusion model in synthesizing HSIs with pixel-level annotations. The main idea is to utilize a two-stream VAE to learn the latent representations of images and corresponding masks respectively, learn their joint distribution during the diffusion model training, and finally obtain the image and mask through their respective decoders. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to generate high-dimensional HSIs with annotations. Our proposed approach can be applied in various kinds of dataset generation. We select two of the most widely used dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation and change detection, and generate datasets suitable for these tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our synthetic datasets have a positive impact on the improvement of these downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent works typically struggle to effectively understand and adapt to dynamic environments due to the inability to update their environment representations in memory according to environment changes and lack of fine-grained reconstruction of the environments. To address these challenges, we propose DynamicGSG, a dynamic, high-fidelity, open-vocabulary scene graph construction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. DynamicGSG builds hierarchical scene graphs using advanced vision language models to represent the spatial and semantic relationships between objects in the environments, utilizes a joint feature loss we designed to supervise Gaussian instance grouping while optimizing the Gaussian maps, and locally updates the Gaussian scene graphs according to real environment changes for long-term environment adaptation. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the performance and efficacy of our proposed method in terms of semantic segmentation, language-guided object retrieval, and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we validate the dynamic updating capabilities of our system in real laboratory environments.

Unlike existing language-embedded 3DGS methods, which rely on a rendering process, our method directly associates language-aligned CLIP embeddings with 3D Gaussians for holistic 3D scene understanding. The key of our method is a language feature registration technique where CLIP embeddings are assigned to the dominant Gaussians intersected by each pixel-ray. Moreover, we integrate Product Quantization (PQ) trained on general large-scale image data to compactly represent embeddings without per-scene optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches in 3D perception benchmarks, such as open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, 3D object localization, and 3D object selection tasks.

While integrated object cognition helps mitigate semantic ambiguity in point-wise feature maps, efficiently obtaining rich semantic understanding and robust incremental reconstruction at the instance-level remains challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce OpenVox, a real-time incremental open-vocabulary probabilistic instance voxel representation. In the front-end, we design an efficient instance segmentation and comprehension pipeline that enhances language reasoning through encoding captions. In the back-end, we implement probabilistic instance voxels and formulate the cross-frame incremental fusion process into two subtasks: instance association and live map evolution, ensuring robustness to sensor and segmentation noise. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that OpenVox achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and open-vocabulary retrieval. Furthermore, real-world robotics experiments validate OpenVox's capability for stable, real-time operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://open-vox.github.io</p></details> | None |

Its real-world adoption in surgical applications, however, remains limited. We review the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning (DL)-based CV models for segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures in videos obtained during surgical procedures. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of studies on semantic segmentation and object detection of anatomical structures published between 2014 and 2024 from 3 major databases - PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore. The primary objective was to evaluate the state-of-the-art performance of semantic segmentation in surgical videos. Secondary objectives included examining DL models, progress toward clinical applications, and the specific challenges with segmentation of organs/tissues in surgical videos. Results: We identified 58 relevant published studies. These focused predominantly on procedures from general surgery [20(34.4%)], colorectal surgery [9(15.5%)], and neurosurgery [8(13.8%)]. Cholecystectomy [14(24.1%)] and low anterior rectal resection [5(8.6%)] were the most common procedures addressed. Semantic segmentation [47(81%)] was the primary CV task. U-Net [14(24.1%)] and DeepLab [13(22.4%)] were the most widely used models. Larger organs such as the liver (Dice score: 0.88) had higher accuracy compared to smaller structures such as nerves (Dice score: 0.49). Models demonstrated real-time inference potential ranging from 5-298 frames-per-second (fps). Conclusion: This review highlights the significant progress made in DL-based semantic segmentation for surgical videos with real-time applicability, particularly for larger organs. Addressing challenges with smaller structures, data availability, and generalizability remains crucial for future advancements.</p></details> | 38 pages, 2 figures | None |
| **[Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation with Reinforcement Learning for Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18510v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers diverse knowledge from a teacher pool to a student network. The core problem of multi-teacher KD is how to balance distillation strengths among various teachers. Most existing methods often develop weighting strategies from an individual perspective of teacher performance or teacher-student gaps, lacking comprehensive information for guidance. This paper proposes Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation with Reinforcement Learning (MTKD-RL) to optimize multi-teacher weights. In this framework, we construct both teacher performance and teacher-student gaps as state information to an agent. The agent outputs the teacher weight and can be updated by the return reward from the student. MTKD-RL reinforces the interaction between the student and teacher using an agent in an RL-based decision mechanism, achieving better matching capability with more meaningful weights. Experimental results on visual recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrate that MTKD-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the existing multi-teacher KD works.</p></details> | AAAI-2025 | None |
| **[FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16025v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Model Transferability of Adversarial Patches in Real-time Segmentation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16012v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models, particularly in safety-critical applications like healthcare and autonomous driving. Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in real-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following this idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic for autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a 'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this attack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized on a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a comprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches trained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S, PIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the Segformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of our analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study reveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs. Transformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude that although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images of any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular model are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true for both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that for CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike ViTs. Per-class analysis reveals that simple-classes like 'sky' suffer less misclassification than others.

Accurate identification of flooded areas is crucial for effective disaster management and urban planning. While few works have utilized convolutional neural networks and transformer-based semantic segmentation techniques for identifying flooded areas from aerial footage, recent developments in graph neural networks have created improvement opportunities. This paper proposes an innovative approach, the Graph Attention Convolutional U-NET (GAC-UNET) model, based on graph neural networks for automated identification of flooded areas. The model incorporates a graph attention mechanism and Chebyshev layers into the U-Net architecture. Furthermore, this paper explores the applicability of transfer learning and model reprogramming to enhance the accuracy of flood area segmentation models. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GAC-UNET model, outperforms other approaches with 91\% mAP, 94\% dice score, and 89\% IoU, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and better planning of future infrastructures in flood-prone areas.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DOEI: Dual Optimization of Embedding Information for Attention-Enhanced Class Activation Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15885v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) typically utilizes limited semantic annotations to obtain initial Class Activation Maps (CAMs). However, due to the inadequate coupling between class activation responses and semantic information in high-dimensional space, the CAM is prone to object co-occurrence or under-activation, resulting in inferior recognition accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose DOEI, Dual Optimization of Embedding Information, a novel approach that reconstructs embedding representations through semantic-aware attention weight matrices to optimize the expression capability of embedding information. Specifically, DOEI amplifies tokens with high confidence and suppresses those with low confidence during the class-to-patch interaction. This alignment of activation responses with semantic information strengthens the propagation and decoupling of target features, enabling the generated embeddings to more accurately represent target features in high-level semantic space. In addition, we propose a hybrid-feature alignment module in DOEI that combines RGB values, embedding-guided features, and self-attention weights to increase the reliability of candidate tokens. Comprehensive experiments show that DOEI is an effective plug-and-play module that empowers state-of-the-art visual transformer-based WSSS models to significantly improve the quality of CAMs and segmentation performance on popular benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC (+3.6%, +1.5%, +1.2% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.2%, +1.6% mIoU).

| **[Aligning Task- and Reconstruction-Oriented Communications for Edge Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15472v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing communication systems aim to reconstruct the information at the receiver side, and are known as reconstruction-oriented communications. This approach often falls short in meeting the real-time, task-specific demands of modern AI-driven applications such as autonomous driving and semantic segmentation. As a new design principle, task-oriented communications have been developed. However, it typically requires joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and modified inference neural networks, resulting in extensive cross-system redesigns and compatibility issues. This paper proposes a novel communication framework that aligns reconstruction-oriented and task-oriented communications for edge intelligence. The idea is to extend the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to optimize data transmission by minimizing task-relevant loss function, while maintaining the structure of the original data by an information reshaper. Such an approach integrates task-oriented communications with reconstruction-oriented communications, where a variational approach is designed to handle the intractability of mutual information in high-dimensional neural network features. We also introduce a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) modulation scheme compatible with classical modulation techniques, enabling the deployment of AI technologies within existing digital infrastructures. The proposed framework is particularly effective in edge-based autonomous driving scenarios. Our evaluation in the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) simulator demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces bits per service by 99.19% compared to existing methods, such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, without compromising the effectiveness of task execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC)</p></details> | None |

The focus of this method is on capturing and transferring knowledge between the intermediate layers of teacher (cumbersome model) and student (compact model). For knowledge extraction, we exploit class prototypes derived from feature maps. To facilitate knowledge transfer, we employ a triplet loss in order to minimize intra-class variances and maximize inter-class variances between teacher and student prototypes. Consequently, I2CKD enables the student to better mimic the feature representation of the teacher for each class, thereby enhancing the segmentation performance of the compact network. Extensive experiments on three segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and CamVid, using various teacher-student network pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Confidence-Weighted Boundary-Aware Learning for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15152v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) aims to improve segmentation performance by utilising unlabeled data alongside limited labeled samples. Existing SSSS methods often face challenges such as coupling, where over-reliance on initial labeled data leads to suboptimal learning; confirmation bias, where incorrect predictions reinforce themselves repeatedly; and boundary blur caused by insufficient boundary-awareness and ambiguous edge information. To address these issues, we propose CW-BASS, a novel framework for SSSS. In order to mitigate the impact of incorrect predictions, we assign confidence weights to pseudo-labels. Additionally, we leverage boundary-delineation techniques, which, despite being extensively explored in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) remain under-explored in SSSS. Specifically, our approach: (1) reduces coupling through a confidence-weighted loss function that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labels based on their predicted confidence scores, (2) mitigates confirmation bias with a dynamic thresholding mechanism that learns to filter out pseudo-labels based on model performance, (3) resolves boundary blur with a boundary-aware module that enhances segmentation accuracy near object boundaries, and (4) reduces label noise with a confidence decay strategy that progressively refines pseudo-labels during training. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, using only 1/8 or 12.5\% of labeled data, our method achieves a mIoU of 75.81 on Pascal VOC 2012, highlighting its effectiveness in limited-label settings.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures | None |

MIM-Refiner is motivated by the insight that strong representations within MIM models generally reside in intermediate layers. Accordingly, MIM-Refiner leverages multiple contrastive heads that are connected to different intermediate layers. In each head, a modified nearest neighbor objective constructs semantic clusters that capture semantic information which improves performance on downstream tasks, including off-the-shelf and fine-tuning settings. The refinement process is short and simple - yet highly effective. Within a few epochs, we refine the features of MIM models from subpar to state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf features. Refining a ViT-H, pre-trained with data2vec 2.0 on ImageNet-1K, sets a new state-of-the-art in linear probing (84.7%) and low-shot classification among models that are pre-trained on ImageNet-1K.

To advance research in such safety-critical systems, determining the precise contribution of spectral information to complex DNNs' output is needed. To address this, several saliency methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), have been proposed primarily for image classification.

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI | None |

While techniques based on Voronoi diagrams or pre-fractured patterns are effective for real-time applications, they fail to incorporate collision conditions when determining fractured shapes during runtime. This paper introduces a novel learning-based approach for predicting fractured shapes based on collision dynamics at runtime. Our approach seamlessly integrates realistic brittle fracture animations with rigid body simulations, utilising boundary element method (BEM) brittle fracture simulations to generate training data. To integrate collision scenarios and fractured shapes into a deep learning framework, we introduce generative geometric segmentation, distinct from both instance and semantic segmentation, to represent 3D fragment shapes. We propose an eight-dimensional latent code to address the challenge of optimising multiple discrete fracture pattern targets that share similar continuous collision latent codes. This code will follow a discrete normal distribution corresponding to a specific fracture pattern within our latent impulse representation design. This adaptation enables the prediction of fractured shapes using neural discrete representation learning. Our experimental results show that our approach generates considerably more detailed brittle fractures than existing techniques, while the computational time is typically reduced compared to traditional simulation methods at comparable resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of an article published in the Computer Graphics Forum.

We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hier-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it exhibits competitive performance in rendering semantic segmentation in small synthetic scenes, with significantly reduced storage and training time requirements.

Given expert-labeled segmented images of irradiated and unirradiated pellets, we trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to segment images into defect, grain, and boundary classes. Qualitative microstructural information was calculated from these segmented images to facilitate the comparison of unirradiated and irradiated pellets. We tested modifications to improve the sensitivity of the model, including incorporating meta-data into the model and utilizing uncertainty quantification. The predicted segmentation was similar to the expert-labeled segmentation for most methods of microstructural qualification, including pixel proportion, defect area, and defect density. Overall, the high performance metrics for the best models for both irradiated and unirradiated images shows that utilizing neural network models is a viable alternative to expert-labeled images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing SSC methods often overlook the high deployment costs in real-world applications. Traditional architectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and self-attention mechanisms, face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for SSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the Mamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic segmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and geometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge. Using simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception training of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive labels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a dual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling efficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing long-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks with deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming competing models while also reducing deployment costs.</p></details> |  | None |

A major challenge in medical image segmentation is achieving accurate delineation of regions of interest in the presence of noise, low contrast, or complex anatomical structures. Existing segmentation models often neglect the integration of multi-grained information and fail to preserve edge details, which are critical for precise segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel image semantic segmentation model called the Multi-Grained Feature Integration Network (MGFI-Net). Our MGFI-Net is designed with two dedicated modules to tackle these issues. First, to enhance segmentation accuracy, we introduce a Multi-Grained Feature Extraction Module, which leverages hierarchical relationships between different feature scales to selectively focus on the most relevant information. Second, to preserve edge details, we incorporate an Edge Enhancement Module that effectively retains and integrates boundary information to refine segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGFI-Net not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy but also achieves superior time efficiency, establishing it as a leading solution for real-time medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

For pixel-wise regression tasks, confidence quantification and assessment has not been well addressed in the literature, in contrast to classification tasks like semantic segmentation. The softmax output layer is not used in deep neural networks that solve pixel-wise regression problems. In this paper, to address these problems, we develop, train and evaluate the proposed model Confidence-Aware Regression Estimation (CARE). Our model CARE computes and assigns confidence to regression output results. We focus on solving regression problems as downstream tasks of an AI Foundation Model for Earth Observation (EO). We evaluate the proposed model CARE and experimental results on data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite constellation for estimating the density of buildings show that the proposed method can be successfully applied to regression problems. We also show that our approach outperforms other methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, Submitted</p></details> | None |

We focus in the cleaning stage on removing outliers from the acquired point cloud data by employing an adaptive threshold technique based on z-score measure. Following the cleaning process, we perform plane detection using the robust RANSAC paradigm. The goal is to carry out multiple plane segmentations, and to classify segments into distinct categories, such as floors, ceilings, and walls. The resulting segments can generate accurate and detailed point clouds representing the building's architectural elements. Moreover, we address the problem of semantic segmentation, which plays a vital role in the identification and classification of different components within the building, such as walls, windows, doors, roofs, and objects. Inspired by the PointNet architecture, we propose a deep learning architecture for efficient semantic segmentation in buildings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in handling building modeling tasks, paving the way for improved accuracy and efficiency in the field of building modelization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generalized Robot 3D Vision-Language Model with Fast Rendering and Pre-Training Vision-Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00663v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural network models have achieved remarkable progress in 3D scene understanding while trained in the closed-set setting and with full labels. However, the major bottleneck is that these models do not have the capacity to recognize any unseen novel classes beyond the training categories in diverse real-world applications. Therefore, we are in urgent need of a framework that can simultaneously be applicable to both 3D point cloud segmentation and detection, particularly in the circumstances where the labels are rather scarce. This work presents a generalized and straightforward framework for dealing with 3D scene understanding when the labeled scenes are quite limited. To extract knowledge for novel categories from the pre-trained vision-language models, we propose a hierarchical feature-aligned pre-training and knowledge distillation strategy to extract and distill meaningful information from large-scale vision-language models, which helps benefit the open-vocabulary scene understanding tasks. To encourage latent instance discrimination and to guarantee efficiency, we propose the unsupervised region-level semantic contrastive learning scheme for point clouds, using confident predictions of the neural network to discriminate the intermediate feature embeddings at multiple stages. In the limited reconstruction case, our proposed approach, termed WS3D++, ranks 1st on the large-scale ScanNet benchmark on both the task of semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. Extensive experiments with both indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in both data-efficient learning and open-world few-shot learning.

By utilizing multi-temporal ALS point clouds, semantic changes in urban area can be captured, demonstrating significant potential in urban planning, emergency management, and infrastructure maintenance. Existing 3D change detection methods struggle to efficiently extract multi-class semantic information and change features, still facing the following challenges: (1) the difficulty of accurately modeling cross-temporal point clouds spatial relationships for effective change feature extraction; (2) class imbalance of change samples which hinders distinguishability of semantic features; (3) the lack of real-world datasets for 3D semantic change detection. To resolve these challenges, we propose the Multi-task Enhanced Cross-temporal Point Transformer (ME-CPT) network. ME-CPT establishes spatiotemporal correspondences between point cloud across different epochs and employs attention mechanisms to jointly extract semantic change features, facilitating information exchange and change comparison. Additionally, we incorporate a semantic segmentation task and through the multi-task training strategy, further enhance the distinguishability of semantic features, reducing the impact of class imbalance in change types. Moreover, we release a 22.5 $km^2$ 3D semantic change detection dataset, offering diverse scenes for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed MT-CPT achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

This makes the evaluation of semantic segmentation quality in such scenarios an issue to be resolved. However, most of the existing evaluation metrics are developed based on expert-labeled object-level annotations, which are not applicable in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose RS-SQA, an unsupervised quality assessment model for RSI semantic segmentation based on vision language model (VLM). This framework leverages a pre-trained RS VLM for semantic understanding and utilizes intermediate features from segmentation methods to extract implicit information about segmentation quality. Specifically, we introduce CLIP-RS, a large-scale pre-trained VLM trained with purified text to reduce textual noise and capture robust semantic information in the RS domain. Feature visualizations confirm that CLIP-RS can effectively differentiate between various levels of segmentation quality. Semantic features and low-level segmentation features are effectively integrated through a semantic-guided approach to enhance evaluation accuracy. To further support the development of RS semantic segmentation quality assessment, we present RS-SQED, a dedicated dataset sampled from four major RS semantic segmentation datasets and annotated with segmentation accuracy derived from the inference results of 8 representative segmentation methods. Experimental results on the established dataset demonstrate that RS-SQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment models. This provides essential support for predicting segmentation accuracy and high-quality semantic segmentation interpretation, offering substantial practical value.</p></details> | 16 pages,6 figures | None |

By concentrating on 3D semantic segmentation, our approach addresses challenges like class imbalance and noisy data to enhance the detection of critical grid components such as power lines and towers.

The leading force of this research is the problem of autonomous driving followed by indoor scene segmentation. However, openly available 3D data on these tasks mainly focuses on urban scenarios. In this paper, we propose TS40K, a 3D point cloud dataset that encompasses more than 40,000 Km on electrical transmission systems situated in European rural terrain. This is not only a novel problem for the research community that can aid in the high-risk mission of power-grid inspection, but it also offers 3D point clouds with distinct characteristics from those in self-driving and indoor 3D data, such as high point-density and no occlusion. In our dataset, each 3D point is labeled with 1 out of 22 annotated classes. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art methods on our dataset concerning 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection.

| **[VividMed: Vision Language Model with Versatile Visual Grounding for Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12694v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable promise in generating visually grounded responses. However, their application in the medical domain is hindered by unique challenges. For instance, most VLMs rely on a single method of visual grounding, whereas complex medical tasks demand more versatile approaches. Additionally, while most VLMs process only 2D images, a large portion of medical images are 3D. The lack of medical data further compounds these obstacles. To address these challenges, we present VividMed, a vision language model with versatile visual grounding for medicine. Our model supports generating both semantic segmentation masks and instance-level bounding boxes, and accommodates various imaging modalities, including both 2D and 3D data. We design a three-stage training procedure and an automatic data synthesis pipeline based on open datasets and models. Besides visual grounding tasks, VividMed also excels in other common downstream tasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) and report generation. Ablation studies empirically show that the integration of visual grounding ability leads to improved performance on these tasks.

| **[DAMamba: Vision State Space Model with Dynamic Adaptive Scan](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12627v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently garnered significant attention in computer vision. However, due to the unique characteristics of image data, adapting SSMs from natural language processing to computer vision has not outperformed the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models.

To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing.

While this flexibility represents a significant advancement, current approaches still rely on manually specified class names as input, creating an inherent bottleneck in real-world applications. This work proposes a Vocabulary-Free Semantic Segmentation pipeline, eliminating the need for predefined class vocabularies. Specifically, we address the chicken-and-egg problem where users need knowledge of all potential objects within a scene to identify them, yet the purpose of segmentation is often to discover these objects. The proposed approach leverages Vision-Language Models to automatically recognize objects and generate appropriate class names, aiming to solve the challenge of class specification and naming quality. Through extensive experiments on several public datasets, we highlight the crucial role of the text encoder in model performance, particularly when the image text classes are paired with generated descriptions. Despite the challenges introduced by the sensitivity of the segmentation text encoder to false negatives within the class tagging process, which adds complexity to the task, we demonstrate that our fully automated pipeline significantly enhances vocabulary-free segmentation accuracy across diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Pattern Recognition Letters, Klara Reichard and Giulia Rizzoli equally contributed to this work</p></details> | None |

However, a notable limitation in this field is the lack of publicly available labelled datasets and a standardised performance evaluation of state-of-the-art DL models on such datasets. This study addresses this gap by comprehensively evaluating various DL models for wound tissue segmentation using a novel dataset. We have curated a dataset comprising 147 wound images exhibiting six tissue types: slough, granulation, maceration, necrosis, bone, and tendon. The dataset was meticulously labelled for semantic segmentation employing supervised machine learning techniques. Three distinct labelling formats were developed -- full image, patch, and superpixel. Our investigation encompassed a wide array of DL segmentation and classification methodologies, ranging from conventional approaches like UNet, to generative adversarial networks such as cGAN, and modified techniques like FPN+VGG16. Also, we explored DL-based classification methods (e.g., ResNet50) and machine learning-based classification leveraging DL features (e.g., AlexNet+RF). In total, 82 wound tissue segmentation models were derived across the three labelling formats. Our analysis yielded several notable findings, including identifying optimal DL models for each labelling format based on weighted average Dice or F1 scores. Notably, FPN+VGG16 emerged as the top-performing DL model for wound tissue segmentation, achieving a dice score of 82.25%. This study provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating wound image segmentation and classification models, offering insights to inform future research and clinical practice in wound care.

This study aimed to establish a solid baseline for the AI-automated assessment of findings in DPRs by developing, evaluating an AI system, and comparing its performance with that of human readers across multinational data sets. We analyzed 6,669 DPRs from three data sets (the Netherlands, Brazil, and Taiwan), focusing on 8 types of dental findings. The AI system combined object detection and semantic segmentation techniques for per-tooth finding identification. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). AI generalizability was tested across data sets, and performance was compared with human dental practitioners. The AI system demonstrated comparable or superior performance to human readers, particularly +67.9% (95% CI: 54.0%-81.9%; p < .001) sensitivity for identifying periapical radiolucencies and +4.7% (95% CI: 1.4%-8.0%; p = .008) sensitivity for identifying missing teeth. The AI achieved a macro-averaged AUC-ROC of 96.2% (95% CI: 94.6%-97.8%) across 8 findings. AI agreements with the reference were comparable to inter-human agreements in 7 of 8 findings except for caries (p = .024). The AI system demonstrated robust generalization across diverse imaging and demographic settings and processed images 79 times faster (95% CI: 75-82) than human readers. The AI system effectively assessed findings in DPRs, achieving performance on par with or better than human experts while significantly reducing interpretation time. These results highlight the potential for integrating AI into clinical workflows to improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, and patient management.</p></details> |  | None |

These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT.

| **[FLARES: Fast and Accurate LiDAR Multi-Range Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09274v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is a critical yet challenging task in autonomous driving, primarily due to the irregularity and sparsity of LiDAR data, as well as the computational demands of processing large-scale point clouds. Recent methods leverage the range-view representation to improve processing efficiency. To mitigate the performance drop caused by information loss inherent to the "many-to-one" problem, where multiple nearby 3D points are mapped to the same 2D grids and only the closest is retained, prior works tend to choose a higher azimuth resolution for range-view projection. However, this can bring the drawback of reducing the proportion of pixels that carry information and heavier computation within the network. We argue that it is not the optimal solution and show that, in contrast, decreasing the resolution is more advantageous in both efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we present a comprehensive re-design of the workflow for range-view-based LiDAR semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses data representation, augmentation, and post-processing methods for improvements. Through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we demonstrate that our pipeline significantly enhances the performance of various network architectures over their baselines, paving the way for more effective LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a low-rank Matryoshka projection and a hybrid segmenting architecture that preserves important information while retaining sufficient pixel geometry for pixel-level tasks. We design the Matryoshka Autoencoder (MatAE-U-Net) which combines the hierarchical encoding of the Matryoshka Autoencoder with the spatial reconstruction capabilities of a U-Net decoder, leveraging multi-scale feature extraction and skip connections to enhance accuracy and generalisation. We apply it to the problem of segmenting the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiographic images using the Stanford EchoNet-D dataset, including 1,000 standardised video-mask pairs of cardiac ultrasound videos resized to 112x112 pixels. The MatAE-UNet model achieves a Mean IoU of 77.68\%, Mean Pixel Accuracy of 97.46\%, and Dice Coefficient of 86.91\%, outperforming the baseline U-Net, which attains a Mean IoU of 74.70\%, Mean Pixel Accuracy of 97.31\%, and Dice Coefficient of 85.20\%. The results highlight the potential of using the U-Net in the recursive Matroshka latent space for imaging problems with low-contrast such as echocardiographic analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FCN+: Global Receptive Convolution Makes FCN Great Again](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04589v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully convolutional network (FCN) is a seminal work for semantic segmentation. However, due to its limited receptive field, FCN cannot effectively capture global context information which is vital for semantic segmentation. As a result, it is beaten by state-of-the-art methods that leverage different filter sizes for larger receptive fields. However, such a strategy usually introduces more parameters and increases the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel global receptive convolution (GRC) to effectively increase the receptive field of FCN for context information extraction, which results in an improved FCN termed FCN+. The GRC provides the global receptive field for convolution without introducing any extra learnable parameters. The motivation of GRC is that different channels of a convolutional filter can have different grid sampling locations across the whole input feature map. Specifically, the GRC first divides the channels of the filter into two groups. The grid sampling locations of the first group are shifted to different spatial coordinates across the whole feature map, according to their channel indexes. This can help the convolutional filter capture the global context information. The grid sampling location of the second group remains unchanged to keep the original location information. By convolving using these two groups, the GRC can integrate the global context into the original location information of each pixel for better dense prediction results. With the GRC built in, FCN+ can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation tasks, as verified on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and ADE20K.

Compared to contrastive approaches that only yield binary learning signals, i.e., 'attract' and 'repel', this approach benefits from the more fine-grained learning signal of sorting spatially dense features relative to reference patches. Our method leverages differentiable sorting applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. This method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establishes several new state-of-the-art results such as +5.5% and +6% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, +7.2% and +5.7% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff and improvements in the 3D understanding of multi-view consistency on SPair-71k, by more than 1.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR25.

General semantic segmentation methods usually fail to fully investigate the above issues, and thus their performances on remote sensing image segmentation are limited. In this paper, we propose our LOGCAN++, a semantic segmentation model customized for remote sensing images, which is made up of a Global Class Awareness (GCA) module and several Local Class Awareness (LCA) modules. The GCA module captures global representations for class-level context modeling to reduce the interference of background noise. The LCA module generates local class representations as intermediate perceptual elements to indirectly associate pixels with the global class representations, targeting at dealing with the large intra-class variance problem. In particular, we introduce affine transformations in the LCA module for adaptive extraction of local class representations to effectively tolerate scale and orientation variations in remotely sensed images. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our LOGCAN++ outperforms current mainstream general and remote sensing semantic segmentation methods and achieves a better trade-off between speed and accuracy.

Further, exploiting additional symmetries facilitates greater weight sharing than standard convolutions, leading to an enhanced network expressivity without an increase in parameter count. However, extending the equivariant properties of a convolution layer comes at a computational cost. In particular, for 3D data, expanding equivariance to the SE(3) group (rotation and translation) results in a 6D convolution operation, which is not tractable for larger data samples such as 3D scene scans. While efforts have been made to develop efficient SE(3) equivariant networks, existing approaches rely on discretization or only introduce global rotation equivariance. This limits their applicability to point clouds representing a scene composed of multiple objects. This work presents an efficient, continuous, and local SE(3) equivariant convolution layer for point cloud processing based on general group convolution and local reference frames. Our experiments show that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of datasets and tasks, including object classification and semantic segmentation, with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode.

This study investigated simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposed "Beyond-Labels," a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a handful of image segmentation data to fuse frozen image representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to successfully actualize enormous knowledge from pretrained models without requiring extensive retraining, making the model data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we efficiently captured positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, thus improving the generalization across various image sizes, addressing one of the key limitations of previous methods. Extensive ablation tests were performed to investigate the important components of our proposed method; when tested against the common benchmark PASCAL-5i, it demonstrated superior performance despite being trained on frozen image and language characteristics.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper investigates Mamba architecture for visual domain applications and its recent advancements, including Vision Mamba (ViM) and VideoMamba, which introduce bidirectional scanning, selective scanning mechanisms, and spatiotemporal processing to enhance image and video understanding. Architectural innovations like position embeddings, cross-scan modules, and hierarchical designs further optimize the Mamba framework for global and local feature extraction.

In contrast to prior refinement techniques that are tailored to specific models or tasks in a close-world manner, we propose SAMRefiner, a universal and efficient approach by adapting SAM to the mask refinement task. The core technique of our model is the noise-tolerant prompting scheme. Specifically, we introduce a multi-prompt excavation strategy to mine diverse input prompts for SAM (i.e., distance-guided points, context-aware elastic bounding boxes, and Gaussian-style masks) from initial coarse masks. These prompts can collaborate with each other to mitigate the effect of defects in coarse masks. In particular, considering the difficulty of SAM to handle the multi-object case in semantic segmentation, we introduce a split-then-merge (STM) pipeline. Additionally, we extend our method to SAMRefiner++ by introducing an additional IoU adaption step to further boost the performance of the generic SAMRefiner on the target dataset. This step is self-boosted and requires no additional annotation. The proposed framework is versatile and can flexibly cooperate with existing segmentation methods. We evaluate our mask framework on a wide range of benchmarks under different settings, demonstrating better accuracy and efficiency. SAMRefiner holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of refinement tools.

Current limitations lead to inaccurate nutritional analysis, inefficient crop management, and suboptimal food processing, impacting food security and public health. Improving segmentation techniques can enhance dietary assessments, agricultural productivity, and the food production process. This study introduces the development of a robust framework for high-quality, near-real-time segmentation and tracking of food items in videos, using minimal hardware resources. We present FoodMem, a novel framework designed to segment food items from video sequences of 360-degree unbounded scenes. FoodMem can consistently generate masks of food portions in a video sequence, overcoming the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models, such as flickering and prohibitive inference speeds in video processing contexts. To address these issues, FoodMem leverages a two-phase solution: a transformer segmentation phase to create initial segmentation masks and a memory-based tracking phase to monitor food masks in complex scenes. Our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art food segmentation models, yielding superior performance across various conditions, such as camera angles, lighting, reflections, scene complexity, and food diversity. This results in reduced segmentation noise, elimination of artifacts, and completion of missing segments. Here, we also introduce a new annotated food dataset encompassing challenging scenarios absent in previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments conducted on MetaFood3D, Nutrition5k, and Vegetables & Fruits datasets demonstrate that FoodMem enhances the state-of-the-art by 2.5% mean average precision in food video segmentation and is 58 x faster on average.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised deep learning for semantic segmentation of multispectral LiDAR forest point clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06227v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point clouds captured with laser scanning systems from forest environments can be utilized in a wide variety of applications within forestry and plant ecology, such as the estimation of tree stem attributes, leaf angle distribution, and above-ground biomass. However, effectively utilizing the data in such tasks requires the semantic segmentation of the data into wood and foliage points, also known as leaf-wood separation. The traditional approach to leaf-wood separation has been geometry- and radiometry-based unsupervised algorithms, which tend to perform poorly on data captured with airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems, even with a high point density. While recent machine and deep learning approaches achieve great results even on sparse point clouds, they require manually labeled training data, which is often extremely laborious to produce. Multispectral (MS) information has been demonstrated to have potential for improving the accuracy of leaf-wood separation, but quantitative assessment of its effects has been lacking. This study proposes a fully unsupervised deep learning method, GrowSP-ForMS, which is specifically designed for leaf-wood separation of high-density MS ALS point clouds and based on the GrowSP architecture. GrowSP-ForMS achieved a mean accuracy of 84.3% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 69.6% on our MS test set, outperforming the unsupervised reference methods by a significant margin. When compared to supervised deep learning methods, our model performed similarly to the slightly older PointNet architecture but was outclassed by more recent approaches. Finally, two ablation studies were conducted, which demonstrated that our proposed changes increased the test set mIoU of GrowSP-ForMS by 29.4 percentage points (pp) in comparison to the original GrowSP model and that utilizing MS data improved the mIoU by 5.6 pp from the monospectral case.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures | None |

Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarize the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages,26 figures,7 tables</p></details> | None |

We introduce LegalSeg, the largest annotated dataset for this task, comprising over 7,000 documents and 1.4 million sentences, labeled with 7 rhetorical roles. To benchmark performance, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models, including Hierarchical BiLSTM-CRF, TransformerOverInLegalBERT (ToInLegalBERT), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Role-Aware Transformers, alongside an exploratory RhetoricLLaMA, an instruction-tuned large language model. Our results demonstrate that models incorporating broader context, structural relationships, and sequential sentence information outperform those relying solely on sentence-level features. Additionally, we conducted experiments using surrounding context and predicted or actual labels of neighboring sentences to assess their impact on classification accuracy. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in distinguishing between closely related roles and addressing class imbalance.

However, they struggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To investigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and identify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated. Specifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes, which we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes evident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated along with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a novel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We introduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them into a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a corresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition (MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This ensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across modalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14 dataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007 and surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training parameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3 methods on COCO and VOC</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing FSS architectures lack sufficient interpretability and fail to fully incorporate the underlying physical structures of semantic regions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep unfolding network, called the Learned Mumford-Shah Network (LMS-Net), for the FSS task. Specifically, motivated by the effectiveness of pixel-to-prototype comparison in prototypical FSS methods and the capability of deep priors to model complex spatial structures, we leverage our learned Mumford-Shah model (LMS model) as a mathematical foundation to integrate these insights into a unified framework. By reformulating the LMS model into prototype update and mask update tasks, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve it efficiently. Further, the iterative steps of this algorithm are unfolded into corresponding network modules, resulting in LMS-Net with clear interpretability. Comprehensive experiments on three publicly available medical segmentation datasets verify the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness in handling complex structures and adapting to challenging segmentation scenarios. These results highlight the potential of LMS-Net to advance FSS in medical imaging applications.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated the field, achieving significant success in 3D medical image segmentation. However, CNNs struggle with capturing long-range dependencies and global context, limiting their performance, particularly for fine and complex structures. Recent transformer-based models, such as TransUNet and nnFormer, have demonstrated promise in addressing these limitations, though they still rely on hybrid CNN-transformer architectures. This paper introduces a novel, fully convolutional-free model based on transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach focuses on improving multi-semantic segmentation accuracy and addressing domain adaptation challenges between thick and thin slice CT images. We propose a joint loss function that facilitates effective segmentation of thin slices based on thick slice annotations, overcoming limitations in dataset availability. Furthermore, we present a benchmark dataset for multi-semantic segmentation on thin slices, addressing a gap in current medical imaging research. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over traditional and hybrid architectures, offering new insights into the future of convolution-free medical image segmentation.</p></details> | technical report | None |

In class incremental semantic segmentation (CISS), the semantic content of image pixels evolves over incremental phases, known as semantic drift. In this work, we identify two critical challenges in CISS that contribute to semantic drift and degrade performance. First, we highlight the issue of separate optimization, where different parts of the model are optimized in distinct incremental stages, leading to misaligned probability scales. Second, we identify noisy semantics arising from inappropriate pseudo-labeling, which results in sub-optimal results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and effective approach, Image Posterior and Semantics Decoupling for Segmentation (IPSeg). IPSeg introduces two key mechanisms: (1) leveraging image posterior probabilities to align optimization across stages and mitigate the effects of separate optimization, and (2) employing semantics decoupling to handle noisy semantics and tailor learning strategies for different semantics. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that IPSeg achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging long-term incremental scenarios.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, the computed features are limited by the information contained in the text, which is particularly problematic in medical imaging, where the findings described by radiologists focus on specific observations. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity of paired imaging-text data due to concerns over leakage of personal health information. In this work, we fundamentally challenge the prevailing reliance on language supervision for learning general-purpose biomedical imaging encoders. We introduce RAD-DINO, a biomedical image encoder pre-trained solely on unimodal biomedical imaging data that obtains similar or greater performance than state-of-the-art biomedical language-supervised models on a diverse range of benchmarks. Specifically, the quality of learned representations is evaluated on standard imaging tasks (classification and semantic segmentation), and a vision-language alignment task (text report generation from images). To further demonstrate the drawback of language supervision, we show that features from RAD-DINO correlate with other medical records (e.g., sex or age) better than language-supervised models, which are generally not mentioned in radiology reports. Finally, we conduct a series of ablations determining the factors in RAD-DINO's performance; notably, we observe that RAD-DINO's downstream performance scales well with the quantity and diversity of training data, demonstrating that image-only supervision is a scalable approach for training a foundational biomedical image encoder. Model weights of RAD-DINO trained on publicly available datasets are available at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/rad-dino.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework.

Most existing methods use equally penalized objectives, which ignore per-point ambiguities and less discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we design adaptive objectives for individual points based on their ambiguity levels, aiming to ensure the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes for high-ambiguity points. Specifically, we first estimate ambiguities based on position embeddings. Then, we develop a margin generator to shift decision boundaries for contrastive feature embeddings, so margins are narrowed due to increasing ambiguities with even negative margins for extremely high-ambiguity points. Experimental results on large-scale datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enable open-set semantic segmentation on camera images, potentially aiding automatic labeling. However,VFMs for 3D data have been limited to adaptations of 2D models, which can introduce inconsistencies to 3D labels. This work introduces Label Any Pointcloud (LeAP), leveraging 2D VFMs to automatically label 3D data with any set of classes in any kind of application whilst ensuring label consistency. Using a Bayesian update, point labels are combined into voxels to improve spatio-temporal consistency. A novel 3D Consistency Network (3D-CN) exploits 3D information to further improve label quality.

| **[Optimized Unet with Attention Mechanism for Multi-Scale Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03813v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is one of the core tasks in the field of computer vision, and its goal is to accurately classify each pixel in an image. The traditional Unet model achieves efficient feature extraction and fusion through an encoder-decoder structure, but it still has certain limitations when dealing with complex backgrounds, long-distance dependencies, and multi-scale targets. To this end, this paper proposes an improved Unet model combined with an attention mechanism, introduces channel attention and spatial attention modules, enhances the model's ability to focus on important features, and optimizes skip connections through a multi-scale feature fusion strategy, thereby improving the combination of global semantic information and fine-grained features. The experiment is based on the Cityscapes dataset and compared with classic models such as FCN, SegNet, DeepLabv3+, and PSPNet. The improved model performs well in terms of mIoU and pixel accuracy (PA), reaching 76.5% and 95.3% respectively. The experimental results verify the superiority of this method in dealing with complex scenes and blurred target boundaries. In addition, this paper discusses the potential of the improved model in practical applications and future expansion directions, indicating that it has broad application value in fields such as autonomous driving, remote sensing image analysis, and medical image processing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Gompertz Linear Units: Leveraging Asymmetry for Enhanced Learning Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03654v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation functions are fundamental elements of deep learning architectures as they significantly influence training dynamics. ReLU, while widely used, is prone to the dying neuron problem, which has been mitigated by variants such as LeakyReLU, PReLU, and ELU that better handle negative neuron outputs. Recently, self-gated activations like GELU and Swish have emerged as state-of-the-art alternatives, leveraging their smoothness to ensure stable gradient flow and prevent neuron inactivity. In this work, we introduce the Gompertz Linear Unit (GoLU), a novel self-gated activation function defined as $\mathrm{GoLU}(x) = x \, \mathrm{Gompertz}(x)$, where $\mathrm{Gompertz}(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}$. The GoLU activation leverages the asymmetry in the Gompertz function to reduce variance in the latent space more effectively compared to GELU and Swish, while preserving robust gradient flow. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including Image Classification, Language Modeling, Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection, Instance Segmentation, and Diffusion, highlight GoLU's superior performance relative to state-of-the-art activation functions, establishing GoLU as a robust alternative to existing activation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, excluding references and appendix</p></details> | None |
| **[DILLEMA: Diffusion and Large Language Models for Multi-Modal Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04378v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the robustness of deep learning models requires comprehensive and diverse testing. Existing approaches, often based on simple data augmentation techniques or generative adversarial networks, are limited in producing realistic and varied test cases. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework for testing vision neural networks that leverages Large Language Models and control-conditioned Diffusion Models to generate synthetic, high-fidelity test cases. Our approach begins by translating images into detailed textual descriptions using a captioning model, allowing the language model to identify modifiable aspects of the image and generate counterfactual descriptions. These descriptions are then used to produce new test images through a text-to-image diffusion process that preserves spatial consistency and maintains the critical elements of the scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using two datasets: ImageNet1K for image classification and SHIFT for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. The results show that our approach can generate significant test cases that reveal weaknesses and improve the robustness of the model through targeted retraining. We conducted a human assessment using Mechanical Turk to validate the generated images. The responses from the participants confirmed, with high agreement among the voters, that our approach produces valid and realistic images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Ordinality in Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20959v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation consists of predicting a semantic label for each image pixel. While existing deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy, they often overlook the ordinal relationships between classes, which can provide critical domain knowledge (e.g., the pupil lies within the iris, and lane markings are part of the road). This paper introduces novel methods for spatial ordinal segmentation that explicitly incorporate these inter-class dependencies. By treating each pixel as part of a structured image space rather than as an independent observation, we propose two regularization terms and a new metric to enforce ordinal consistency between neighboring pixels. Two loss regularization terms and one metric are proposed for structural ordinal segmentation, which penalizes predictions of non-ordinal adjacent classes. Five biomedical datasets and multiple configurations of autonomous driving datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. Our approach achieves improvements in ordinal metrics and enhances generalization, with up to a 15.7% relative increase in the Dice coefficient. Importantly, these benefits come without additional inference time costs. This work highlights the significance of spatial ordinal relationships in semantic segmentation and provides a foundation for further exploration in structured image representations.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

| **[Globality Strikes Back: Rethinking the Global Knowledge of CLIP in Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06818v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works modify CLIP to perform open-vocabulary semantic segmentation in a training-free manner (TF-OVSS). In CLIP, patch-wise image representations mainly encode the homogeneous image-level properties and thus are not discriminative enough, hindering its application to the dense prediction task. Previous works make image features more distinct across patches, through making each patch mainly attend to itself or the neighboring patches within a narrow local window. However, with their modifications, the ability of CLIP to aggregate global context information, which is known to be useful for distinguishing confusing categories, is largely weakened. In this paper, we propose a new method named GCLIP, which mines the beneficial global knowledge of CLIP to facilitate the TF-OVSS task. Firstly, we aim to equip the last-block attention with image-level properties while not introducing homogeneous attention patterns across patches. In GCLIP, we merge the attention from the global token emerging blocks with the Query-Query attention to realize this goal. Secondly, we aim to make the Value embeddings of the last-block attention module more distinct and semantically correlated. To realize this, we design a novel channel suppression strategy. As the representation of each patch is finally determined by the attention weights and the Value embeddings, our method can generate more discriminative patch-level image features while absorbing global context information. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Muographic Image Upsampling with Machine Learning for Built Infrastructure Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02624v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The civil engineering industry faces a critical need for innovative non-destructive evaluation methods, particularly for ageing critical infrastructure, such as bridges, where current techniques fall short. Muography, a non-invasive imaging technique, constructs three-dimensional density maps by detecting interactions of naturally occurring cosmic-ray muons within the scanned volume. Cosmic-ray muons provide deep penetration and inherent safety due to their high momenta and natural source. However, the technology's reliance on this source results in constrained muon flux, leading to prolonged acquisition times, noisy reconstructions and image interpretation challenges. To address these limitations, we developed a two-model deep learning approach. First, we employed a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP) to perform predictive upsampling of undersampled muography images. Using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), 1-day sampled images matched the perceptual qualities of a 21-day image, while the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) indicated noise improvement equivalent to 31 days of sampling. A second cWGAN-GP model, trained for semantic segmentation, quantitatively assessed the upsampling model's impact on concrete sample features. This model achieved segmentation of rebar grids and tendon ducts, with Dice-S{\o}rensen accuracy coefficients of 0.8174 and 0.8663. Notably, it could mitigate or remove z-plane smearing artifacts caused by muography's inverse imaging problem. Both models were trained on a comprehensive Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulation dataset reflecting realistic civil infrastructure scenarios. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in acquisition speed and image quality, marking a substantial step toward making muography more practical for reinforced concrete infrastructure monitoring applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transfer Risk Map: Mitigating Pixel-level Negative Transfer in Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02340v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to mitigate negative transfer in transfer learning is a long-standing and challenging issue, especially in the application of medical image segmentation. Existing methods for reducing negative transfer focus on classification or regression tasks, ignoring the non-uniform negative transfer risk in different image regions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective weighted fine-tuning method that directs the model's attention towards regions with significant transfer risk for medical semantic segmentation. Specifically, we compute a transferability-guided transfer risk map to quantify the transfer hardness for each pixel and the potential risks of negative transfer. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a map-weighted loss function, normalized with image foreground size to counter class imbalance. Extensive experiments on brain segmentation datasets show our method significantly improves the target task performance, with gains of 4.37% on FeTS2021 and 1.81% on iSeg2019, avoiding negative transfer across modalities and tasks. Meanwhile, a 2.9% gain under a few-shot scenario validates the robustness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UNIP: Rethinking Pre-trained Attention Patterns for Infrared Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02257v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training techniques significantly enhance the performance of semantic segmentation tasks with limited training data. However, the efficacy under a large domain gap between pre-training (e.g. RGB) and fine-tuning (e.g. infrared) remains underexplored. In this study, we first benchmark the infrared semantic segmentation performance of various pre-training methods and reveal several phenomena distinct from the RGB domain. Next, our layerwise analysis of pre-trained attention maps uncovers that: (1) There are three typical attention patterns (local, hybrid, and global); (2) Pre-training tasks notably influence the pattern distribution across layers; (3) The hybrid pattern is crucial for semantic segmentation as it attends to both nearby and foreground elements; (4) The texture bias impedes model generalization in infrared tasks. Building on these insights, we propose UNIP, a UNified Infrared Pre-training framework, to enhance the pre-trained model performance. This framework uses the hybrid-attention distillation NMI-HAD as the pre-training target, a large-scale mixed dataset InfMix for pre-training, and a last-layer feature pyramid network LL-FPN for fine-tuning. Experimental results show that UNIP outperforms various pre-training methods by up to 13.5\% in average mIoU on three infrared segmentation tasks, evaluated using fine-tuning and linear probing metrics. UNIP-S achieves performance on par with MAE-L while requiring only 1/10 of the computational cost. Furthermore, UNIP significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) infrared or RGB segmentation methods and demonstrates broad potential for application in other modalities, such as RGB and depth.

| **[Deep Ensemble approach for Enhancing Brain Tumor Segmentation in Resource-Limited Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02179v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation of brain tumors is a critical step in treatment planning, yet manual segmentation is both time-consuming and subjective, relying heavily on the expertise of radiologists. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this challenge is magnified by overburdened medical systems and limited access to advanced imaging modalities and expert radiologists. Automating brain tumor segmentation using deep learning offers a promising solution. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially the U-Net architecture, have shown significant potential. However, a major challenge remains: achieving generalizability across different datasets. This study addresses this gap by developing a deep learning ensemble that integrates UNet3D, V-Net, and MSA-VNet models for the semantic segmentation of gliomas. By initially training on the BraTS-GLI dataset and fine-tuning with the BraTS-SSA dataset, we enhance model performance. Our ensemble approach significantly outperforms individual models, achieving DICE scores of 0.8358 for Tumor Core, 0.8521 for Whole Tumor, and 0.8167 for Enhancing Tumor. These results underscore the potential of ensemble methods in improving the accuracy and reliability of automated brain tumor segmentation, particularly in resource-limited settings.</p></details> |  | None |
