| **[Mean of Means: A 10-dollar Solution for Human Localization with Calibration-free and Unconstrained Camera Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20870v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human localization is crucial for various applications, especially in the Metaverse era. Existing high precision solutions rely on expensive, tag-dependent hardware, while vision-based methods offer a cheaper, tag-free alternative. However, current vision solutions based on stereo vision face limitations due to rigid perspective transformation principles and error propagation in multi-stage SVD solvers. These solutions also require multiple high-resolution cameras with strict setup constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic approach that considers all points on the human body as observations generated by a distribution centered around the body's geometric center. This enables us to improve sampling significantly, increasing the number of samples for each point of interest from hundreds to billions. By modeling the relation between the means of the distributions of world coordinates and pixel coordinates, leveraging the Central Limit Theorem, we ensure normality and facilitate the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate human localization accuracy of 95% within a 0.3m range and nearly 100% accuracy within a 0.5m range, achieved at a low cost of only 10 USD using two web cameras with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the fast flight speed of the shuttlecock, along with various visual effects, and its tendency to blend with environmental elements, such as court lines and lighting, present challenges for rapid and accurate 2D detection. In this paper, we first propose the YO-CSA detection network, which optimizes and reconfigures the YOLOv8s model's backbone, neck, and head by incorporating contextual and spatial attention mechanisms to enhance model's ability in extracting and integrating both global and local features. Next, we integrate three major subtasks, detection, prediction, and compensation, into a real-time 3D shuttlecock trajectory detection system. Specifically, our system maps the 2D coordinate sequence extracted by YO-CSA into 3D space using stereo vision, then predicts the future 3D coordinates based on historical information, and re-projects them onto the left and right views to update the position constraints for 2D detection. Additionally, our system includes a compensation module to fill in missing intermediate frames, ensuring a more complete trajectory. We conduct extensive experiments on our own dataset to evaluate both YO-CSA's performance and system effectiveness. Experimental results show that YO-CSA achieves a high accuracy of 90.43% mAP@0.75, surpassing both YOLOv8s and YOLO11s. Our system performs excellently, maintaining a speed of over 130 fps across 12 test sequences.</p></details> | 8 pages,14 figures | None |
| **[EndoPerfect: A Hybrid NeRF-Stereo Vision Approach Pioneering Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction in Endoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04041v4)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) demands exceptional accuracy, with the mean error and standard deviation necessitating within the range of a single CT slice (0.625 mm), as the critical structures in the nasal cavity are situated within submillimeter distances from surgical instruments. This poses a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular endoscopes. Depth estimation is crucial for 3D reconstruction, yet existing depth estimation methodologies either suffer from inherent accuracy limitations or, in the case of learning-based approaches, perform poorly when applied to ESS despite succeeding on their original datasets. In this study, we present a novel, highly generalizable method that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and stereo depth estimation for 3D reconstruction that can derive metric monocular depth. Our approach begins with an initial NeRF reconstruction yielding a coarse 3D scene, the subsequent creation of binocular pairs within coarse 3D scene, and generation of depth maps through stereo vision, These depth maps are used to supervise subsequent NeRF iteration, progressively refining NeRF and binocular depth, the refinement process continues until the depth maps converged. This recursive process generates high-accuracy depth maps from monocular endoscopic video. Evaluation in synthetic endoscopy shows a depth accuracy of 0.125 $\pm$ 0.443 mm, well within the 0.625 mm threshold. Further clinical experiments with real endoscopic data demonstrate a mean distance to CT mesh of 0.269 mm, representing the highest accuracy among monocular 3D reconstruction methods in ESS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[H-Net: A Multitask Architecture for Simultaneous 3D Force Estimation and Stereo Semantic Segmentation in Intracardiac Catheters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00514v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success rate of catheterization procedures is closely linked to the sensory data provided to the surgeon. Vision-based deep learning models can deliver both tactile and visual information in a sensor-free manner, while also being cost-effective to produce. Given the complexity of these models for devices with limited computational resources, research has focused on force estimation and catheter segmentation separately. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive architecture capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two different angles and estimating the applied forces in 3D. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a novel, lightweight, multi-input, multi-output encoder-decoder-based architecture. It is designed to segment the catheter from two points of view and concurrently measure the applied forces in the x, y, and z directions. This network processes two simultaneous X-Ray images, intended to be fed by a biplane fluoroscopy system, showing a catheter's deflection from different angles. It uses two parallel sub-networks with shared parameters to output two segmentation maps corresponding to the inputs. Additionally, it leverages stereo vision to estimate the applied forces at the catheter's tip in 3D. The architecture features two input channels, two classification heads for segmentation, and a regression head for force estimation through a single end-to-end architecture. The output of all heads was assessed and compared with the literature, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and force estimation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such a model has been proposed</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data Fusion of Semantic and Depth Information in the Context of Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03490v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Considerable study has already been conducted regarding autonomous driving in modern era. An autonomous driving system must be extremely good at detecting objects surrounding the car to ensure safety. In this paper, classification, and estimation of an object's (pedestrian) position (concerning an ego 3D coordinate system) are studied and the distance between the ego vehicle and the object in the context of autonomous driving is measured. To classify the object, faster Region-based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) with inception v2 is utilized. First, a network is trained with customized dataset to estimate the reference position of objects as well as the distance from the vehicle. From camera calibration to computing the distance, cutting-edge technologies of computer vision algorithms in a series of processes are applied to generate a 3D reference point of the region of interest. The foremost step in this process is generating a disparity map using the concept of stereo vision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bidirectional Stereo Image Compression with Cross-Dimensional Entropy Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10632v2)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of stereo vision technologies, stereo image compression has emerged as a crucial field that continues to draw significant attention. Previous approaches have primarily employed a unidirectional paradigm, where the compression of one view is dependent on the other, resulting in imbalanced compression. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric bidirectional stereo image compression architecture, named BiSIC. Specifically, we propose a 3D convolution based codec backbone to capture local features and incorporate bidirectional attention blocks to exploit global features. Moreover, we design a novel cross-dimensional entropy model that integrates various conditioning factors, including the spatial context, channel context, and stereo dependency, to effectively estimate the distribution of latent representations for entropy coding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed BiSIC outperforms conventional image/video compression standards, as well as state-of-the-art learning-based methods, in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |

Inspired by the adaptive vision of various species, our visual system addresses traditional stereo vision limitations, i.e., immutable camera alignment with narrow fields of view, by introducing a reconfigurable stereo vision system to robotics. Our key innovations include the reconfigurable stereo vision strategy that allows dynamic camera alignment, a robust depth measurement system utilizing a nonrectified geometrical method combined with a deep neural network for feature matching, and a geometrical compensation technique to enhance visual accuracy. Implemented on a metamorphic robot, this vision system demonstrates its great adaptability to various scenarios by switching its configurations of 316{\deg} monocular with 79{\deg} binocular field for fast target seeking and 242{\deg} monocular with 150{\deg} binocular field for detailed close inspection.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[HiSplat: Hierarchical 3D Gaussian Splatting for Generalizable Sparse-View Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06245v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints is a fundamental task in stereo vision. Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have enabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input views by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra optimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D Gaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture details, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained Gaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians to enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we propose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion Module for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of hierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only two-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and cross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The corresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians reveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness.

| **[Drone Stereo Vision for Radiata Pine Branch Detection and Distance Measurement: Utilizing Deep Learning and YOLO Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00503v2)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research focuses on the development of a drone equipped with pruning tools and a stereo vision camera to accurately detect and measure the spatial positions of tree branches. YOLO is employed for branch segmentation, while two depth estimation approaches, monocular and stereo, are investigated. In comparison to SGBM, deep learning techniques produce more refined and accurate depth maps. In the absence of ground-truth data, a fine-tuning process using deep neural networks is applied to approximate optimal depth values. This methodology facilitates precise branch detection and distance measurement, addressing critical challenges in the automation of pruning operations. The results demonstrate notable advancements in both accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the potential of deep learning to drive innovation and enhance automation in the agricultural sector.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fast Object Detection with a Machine Learning Edge Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04173v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This machine learning study investigates a lowcost edge device integrated with an embedded system having computer vision and resulting in an improved performance in inferencing time and precision of object detection and classification. A primary aim of this study focused on reducing inferencing time and low-power consumption and to enable an embedded device of a competition-ready autonomous humanoid robot and to support real-time object recognition, scene understanding, visual navigation, motion planning, and autonomous navigation of the robot. This study compares processors for inferencing time performance between a central processing unit (CPU), a graphical processing unit (GPU), and a tensor processing unit (TPU). CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs are all processors that can be used for machine learning tasks. Related to the aim of supporting an autonomous humanoid robot, there was an additional effort to observe whether or not there was a significant difference in using a camera having monocular vision versus stereo vision capability. TPU inference time results for this study reflect a 25% reduction in time over the GPU, and a whopping 87.5% reduction in inference time compared to the CPU. Much information in this paper is contributed to the final selection of Google's Coral brand, Edge TPU device. The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Tiny ML Kit was also considered for comparison but due to initial incompatibilities and in the interest of time to complete this study, a decision was made to review the kit in a future experiment.</p></details> |  | None |

A new framework for correspondence is introduced that integrates a neural-based algorithm to achieve stereo correspondence locally while, simultaneously, organizing the corresponding points into global perceptual units. The result is an effective scene segmentation. We achieve this using harmonic analysis on the sub-Riemannian structure and show, in a comparison against Riemannian distance, that the sub-Riemannian metric is central to the solution.</p></details> | 30 pages, 13 figures | None |
| **[Drone Stereo Vision for Radiata Pine Branch Detection and Distance Measurement: Integrating SGBM and Segmentation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17526v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual pruning of radiata pine trees presents significant safety risks due to their substantial height and the challenging terrains in which they thrive. To address these risks, this research proposes the development of a drone-based pruning system equipped with specialized pruning tools and a stereo vision camera, enabling precise detection and trimming of branches. Deep learning algorithms, including YOLO and Mask R-CNN, are employed to ensure accurate branch detection, while the Semi-Global Matching algorithm is integrated to provide reliable distance estimation. The synergy between these techniques facilitates the precise identification of branch locations and enables efficient, targeted pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined implementation of YOLO and SGBM enables the drone to accurately detect branches and measure their distances from the drone. This research not only improves the safety and efficiency of pruning operations but also makes a significant contribution to the advancement of drone technology in the automation of agricultural and forestry practices, laying a foundational framework for further innovations in environmental management.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EF-Calib: Spatiotemporal Calibration of Event- and Frame-Based Cameras Using Continuous-Time Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17278v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event camera, a bio-inspired asynchronous triggered camera, offers promising prospects for fusion with frame-based cameras owing to its low latency and high dynamic range. However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

| **[D3RoMa: Disparity Diffusion-based Depth Sensing for Material-Agnostic Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14365v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth sensing is an important problem for 3D vision-based robotics. Yet, a real-world active stereo or ToF depth camera often produces noisy and incomplete depth which bottlenecks robot performances. In this work, we propose D3RoMa, a learning-based depth estimation framework on stereo image pairs that predicts clean and accurate depth in diverse indoor scenes, even in the most challenging scenarios with translucent or specular surfaces where classical depth sensing completely fails. Key to our method is that we unify depth estimation and restoration into an image-to-image translation problem by predicting the disparity map with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model. At inference time, we further incorporated a left-right consistency constraint as classifier guidance to the diffusion process. Our framework combines recently advanced learning-based approaches and geometric constraints from traditional stereo vision. For model training, we create a large scene-level synthetic dataset with diverse transparent and specular objects to compensate for existing tabletop datasets. The trained model can be directly applied to real-world in-the-wild scenes and achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple public depth estimation benchmarks. Further experiments in real environments show that accurate depth prediction significantly improves robotic manipulation in various scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Object Depth and Size Estimation using Stereo-vision and Integration with SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07623v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots use simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for efficient and safe navigation in various environments. LiDAR sensors are integral in these systems for object identification and localization. However, LiDAR systems though effective in detecting solid objects (e.g., trash bin, bottle, etc.), encounter limitations in identifying semitransparent or non-tangible objects (e.g., fire, smoke, steam, etc.) due to poor reflecting characteristics. Additionally, LiDAR also fails to detect features such as navigation signs and often struggles to detect certain hazardous materials that lack a distinct surface for effective laser reflection. In this paper, we propose a highly accurate stereo-vision approach to complement LiDAR in autonomous robots. The system employs advanced stereo vision-based object detection to detect both tangible and non-tangible objects and then uses simple machine learning to precisely estimate the depth and size of the object. The depth and size information is then integrated into the SLAM process to enhance the robot's navigation capabilities in complex environments. Our evaluation, conducted on an autonomous robot equipped with LiDAR and stereo-vision systems demonstrates high accuracy in the estimation of an object's depth and size. A video illustration of the proposed scheme is available at: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nusI6tA9eSk}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version of the published article in IEEE Sensors Letters</p></details> | None |

This can be problematic in environments where hygiene is of primary importance. In this work we present a contactless vascular biometrics sensor platform named \sweet which can be used for hand vascular biometrics studies (wrist, palm, and finger-vein) and surface features such as palmprint. It supports several acquisition modalities such as multi-spectral Near-Infrared (NIR), RGB-color, Stereo Vision (SV) and Photometric Stereo (PS). Using this platform we collect a dataset consisting of the fingers, palm and wrist vascular data of 120 subjects and develop a powerful 3D pipeline for the pre-processing of this data. We then present biometric experimental results, focusing on Finger-Vein Recognition (FVR). Finally, we discuss fusion of multiple modalities, such palm-vein combined with palm-print biometrics. The acquisition software, parts of the hardware design, the new FV dataset, as well as source-code for our experiments are publicly available for research purposes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Extending 6D Object Pose Estimators for Stereo Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05610v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects accurately, quickly, and robustly remains a difficult task. However, recent methods for directly regressing poses from RGB images using dense features have achieved state-of-the-art results. Stereo vision, which provides an additional perspective on the object, can help reduce pose ambiguity and occlusion. Moreover, stereo can directly infer the distance of an object, while mono-vision requires internalized knowledge of the object's size. To extend the state-of-the-art in 6D object pose estimation to stereo, we created a BOP compatible stereo version of the YCB-V dataset. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation algorithms by utilizing stereo vision and can easily be adopted for other dense feature-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>4th I...</summary><p>4th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (ICPRAI)</p></details> | None |

Among these, notched tubular continuum robots (NTCR) show great potential in many delicate applications. Existing works in robotic modeling focus on kinematics and dynamics but still face challenges in reproducing the robot's morphology -- a significant factor that can expand the research landscape of continuum robots, especially for those with asymmetric continuum structures. This paper proposes a dual stereo vision-based method for the three-dimensional morphological reconstruction of millimeter-scale NTCRs. The method employs two oppositely located stationary binocular cameras to capture the point cloud of the NTCR, then utilizes predefined geometry as a reference for the KD tree method to relocate the capture point clouds, resulting in a morphologically correct NTCR despite the low-quality raw point cloud collection. The method has been proved feasible for an NTCR with a 3.5 mm diameter, capturing 14 out of 16 notch features, with the measurements generally centered around the standard of 1.5 mm, demonstrating the capability of revealing morphological details. Our proposed method paves the way for 3D morphological reconstruction of millimeter-scale soft robots for further self-modeling study.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Robio 2024</p></details> | None |

Digital Twins (DT) are one such transformational technology that leverages software systems to replicate physical process behavior, representing the physical process in a digital environment. This paper aims to explore the use of photogrammetry (which is the process of reconstructing physical objects into virtual 3D models using photographs) and 3D Scanning techniques to create accurate visual representation of the 'Physical Process', to interact with the ML/AI based behavior models. To achieve this, we have used a readily available consumer device, the iPhone 15 Pro, which features stereo vision capabilities, to capture the depth of an Industry 4.0 system. By processing these images using 3D scanning tools, we created a raw 3D model for 3D modeling and rendering software for the creation of a DT model. The paper highlights the reliability of this method by measuring the error rate in between the ground truth (measurements done manually using a tape measure) and the final 3D model created using this method. The overall mean error is 4.97\% and the overall standard deviation error is 5.54\% between the ground truth measurements and their photogrammetry counterparts. The results from this work indicate that photogrammetry using consumer-grade devices can be an efficient and cost-efficient approach to creating DTs for smart manufacturing, while the approaches flexibility allows for iterative improvements of the models over time.</p></details> |  | None |

The 3-DOF robot will transmit human-like head movements, i.e., yaw, pitch, roll and produce 3D stereoscopic video and stream it in Real-time. This video stream is sent to the user through any generic internet devices with VR box support, i.e., smartphones giving the user a First-person real-time 3D experience and transfers the head motion of the user to the robot also in Real-time. The robot will also be able to track moving objects and faces as a target using deep neural networks which enables it to be a standalone monitoring robot. The user will be able to choose specific subjects to monitor in a space. The stereovision enables us to track the depth information of different objects detected and will be used to track human interest objects with its distances and sent to the cloud.

| **[Geometry-Informed Distance Candidate Selection for Adaptive Lightweight Omnidirectional Stereo Vision with Fisheye Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05355v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view stereo omnidirectional distance estimation usually needs to build a cost volume with many hypothetical distance candidates. The cost volume building process is often computationally heavy considering the limited resources a mobile robot has. We propose a new geometry-informed way of distance candidates selection method which enables the use of a very small number of candidates and reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate the use of the geometry-informed candidates in a set of model variants. We find that by adjusting the candidates during robot deployment, our geometry-informed distance candidates also improve a pre-trained model's accuracy if the extrinsics or the number of cameras changes. Without any re-training or fine-tuning, our models outperform models trained with evenly distributed distance candidates. Models are also released as hardware-accelerated versions with a new dedicated large-scale dataset.

| **[DMODE: Differential Monocular Object Distance Estimation Module without Class Specific Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12596v3)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing a single camera for measuring object distances is a cost-effective alternative to stereo-vision and LiDAR. Although monocular distance estimation has been explored in the literature, most existing techniques rely on object class knowledge to achieve high performance. Without this contextual data, monocular distance estimation becomes more challenging, lacking reference points and object-specific cues. However, these cues can be misleading for objects with wide-range variation or adversarial situations, which is a challenging aspect of object-agnostic distance estimation. In this paper, we propose DMODE, a class-agnostic method for monocular distance estimation that does not require object class knowledge. DMODE estimates an object's distance by fusing its fluctuation in size over time with the camera's motion, making it adaptable to various object detectors and unknown objects, thus addressing these challenges. We evaluate our model on the KITTI MOTS dataset using ground-truth bounding box annotations and outputs from TrackRCNN and EagerMOT. The object's location is determined using the change in bounding box sizes and camera position without measuring the object's detection source or class attributes. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in multi-class object distance detection scenarios compared to conventional methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

| **[A Minimal Set of Parameters Based Depth-Dependent Distortion Model and Its Calibration Method for Stereo Vision Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19242v2)** | 2024-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth position highly affects lens distortion, especially in close-range photography, which limits the measurement accuracy of existing stereo vision systems. Moreover, traditional depth-dependent distortion models and their calibration methods have remained complicated. In this work, we propose a minimal set of parameters based depth-dependent distortion model (MDM), which considers the radial and decentering distortions of the lens to improve the accuracy of stereo vision systems and simplify their calibration process. In addition, we present an easy and flexible calibration method for the MDM of stereo vision systems with a commonly used planar pattern, which requires cameras to observe the planar pattern in different orientations. The proposed technique is easy to use and flexible compared with classical calibration techniques for depth-dependent distortion models in which the lens must be perpendicular to the planar pattern. The experimental validation of the MDM and its calibration method showed that the MDM improved the calibration accuracy by 56.55% and 74.15% compared with the Li's distortion model and traditional Brown's distortion model. Besides, an iteration-based reconstruction method is proposed to iteratively estimate the depth information in the MDM during three-dimensional reconstruction. The results showed that the accuracy of the iteration-based reconstruction method was improved by 9.08% compared with that of the non-iteration reconstruction method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> | None |

However, these pipelines are sensitive to the changes between images that can occur as a result of multi-date acquisitions. Such variations are mainly due to variable shadows, reflexions and transient objects (cars, vegetation). To take such changes into account, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently been applied to multi-date satellite imagery. However, Neural methods are very compute-intensive, taking dozens of hours to learn, compared with minutes for standard stereo-vision pipelines. Following the ideas of Instant Neural Graphics Primitives we propose to use an efficient sampling strategy and multi-resolution hash encoding to accelerate the learning. Our model, Satellite Neural Graphics Primitives (SAT-NGP) decreases the learning time to 15 minutes while maintaining the quality of the 3D reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table; Accepted to International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2024; Code available at https://github.com/Ellimac0/SAT-NGP</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Ellimac0/SAT-NGP) |
| **[Landmark-based Localization using Stereo Vision and Deep Learning in GPS-Denied Battlefield Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12551v1)** | 2024-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localization in a battlefield environment is increasingly challenging as GPS connectivity is often denied or unreliable, and physical deployment of anchor nodes across wireless networks for localization can be difficult in hostile battlefield terrain. Existing range-free localization methods rely on radio-based anchors and their average hop distance which suffers from accuracy and stability in dynamic and sparse wireless network topology. Vision-based methods like SLAM and Visual Odometry use expensive sensor fusion techniques for map generation and pose estimation. This paper proposes a novel framework for localization in non-GPS battlefield environments using only the passive camera sensors and considering naturally existing or artificial landmarks as anchors. The proposed method utilizes a customcalibrated stereo vision camera for distance estimation and the YOLOv8s model, which is trained and fine-tuned with our real-world dataset for landmark recognition. The depth images are generated using an efficient stereomatching algorithm, and distances to landmarks are determined by extracting the landmark depth feature utilizing a bounding box predicted by the landmark recognition model. The position of the unknown node is then obtained using the efficient least square algorithm and then optimized using the L-BFGS-B (limited-memory quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained optimization) method. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework performs better than existing anchorbased DV-Hop algorithms and competes with the most efficient vision-based algorithms in terms of localization error (RMSE).</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.12320</p></details> | None |
| **[Landmark Stereo Dataset for Landmark Recognition and Moving Node Localization in a Non-GPS Battlefield Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12320v1)** | 2024-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we have proposed a new strategy of using the landmark anchor node instead of a radio-based anchor node to obtain the virtual coordinates (landmarkID, DISTANCE) of moving troops or defense forces that will help in tracking and maneuvering the troops along a safe path within a GPS-denied battlefield environment. The proposed strategy implements landmark recognition using the Yolov5 model and landmark distance estimation using an efficient Stereo Matching Algorithm. We consider that a moving node carrying a low-power mobile device facilitated with a calibrated stereo vision camera that captures stereo images of a scene containing landmarks within the battlefield region whose locations are stored in an offline server residing within the device itself. We created a custom landmark image dataset called MSTLandmarkv1 with 34 landmark classes and another landmark stereo dataset of those 34 landmark instances called MSTLandmarkStereov1. We trained the YOLOv5 model with MSTLandmarkv1 dataset and achieved 0.95 mAP @ 0.5 IoU and 0.767 mAP @ [0.5: 0.95] IoU. We calculated the distance from a node to the landmark utilizing the bounding box coordinates and the depth map generated by the improved SGM algorithm using MSTLandmarkStereov1. The tuple of landmark IDs obtained from the detection result and the distances calculated by the SGM algorithm are stored as the virtual coordinates of a node. In future work, we will use these virtual coordinates to obtain the location of a node using an efficient trilateration algorithm and optimize the node position using the appropriate optimization method.</p></details> |  | None |

MMAUD addresses a critical gap in contemporary threat detection methodologies by focusing on drone detection, UAV-type classification, and trajectory estimation. MMAUD stands out by combining diverse sensory inputs, including stereo vision, various Lidars, Radars, and audio arrays. It offers a unique overhead aerial detection vital for addressing real-world scenarios with higher fidelity than datasets captured on specific vantage points using thermal and RGB. Additionally, MMAUD provides accurate Leica-generated ground truth data, enhancing credibility and enabling confident refinement of algorithms and models, which has never been seen in other datasets. Most existing works do not disclose their datasets, making MMAUD an invaluable resource for developing accurate and efficient solutions. Our proposed modalities are cost-effective and highly adaptable, allowing users to experiment and implement new UAV threat detection tools. Our dataset closely simulates real-world scenarios by incorporating ambient heavy machinery sounds. This approach enhances the dataset's applicability, capturing the exact challenges faced during proximate vehicular operations. It is expected that MMAUD can play a pivotal role in advancing UAV threat detection, classification, trajectory estimation capabilities, and beyond.

| **[Left-right Discrepancy for Adversarial Attack on Stereo Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07188v1)** | 2024-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching neural networks often involve a Siamese structure to extract intermediate features from left and right images. The similarity between these intermediate left-right features significantly impacts the accuracy of disparity estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial attack approach that generates perturbation noise specifically designed to maximize the discrepancy between left and right image features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior capability of our method to induce larger prediction errors in stereo neural networks, e.g. outperforming existing state-of-the-art attack methods by 219% MAE on the KITTI dataset and 85% MAE on the Scene Flow dataset. Additionally, we extend our approach to include a proxy network black-box attack method, eliminating the need for access to stereo neural network. This method leverages an arbitrary network from a different vision task as a proxy to generate adversarial noise, effectively causing the stereo network to produce erroneous predictions. Our findings highlight a notable sensitivity of stereo networks to discrepancies in shallow layer features, offering valuable insights that could guide future research in enhancing the robustness of stereo vision systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Utilizing AUVs in underwater human-robot interaction (UHRI) has witnessed comparatively smaller levels of growth due to limitations in bi-directional communication and significant technical hurdles to bridge the gap between analogies with terrestrial interaction strategies and those that are possible in the underwater domain. A necessary component to support UHRI is establishing a system for safe robotic-diver approach to establish face-to-face communication that considers non-standard human body pose. In this work, we introduce a stereo vision system for enhancing UHRI that utilizes three-dimensional reconstruction from stereo image pairs and machine learning for localizing human joint estimates. We then establish a convention for a coordinate system that encodes the direction the human is facing with respect to the camera coordinate frame. This allows automatic setpoint computation that preserves human body scale and can be used as input to an image-based visual servo control scheme. We show that our setpoint computations tend to agree both quantitatively and qualitatively with experimental setpoint baselines. The methodology introduced shows promise for enhancing UHRI by improving robotic perception of human orientation underwater.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of the 2024 IEEE Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> | None |

TeFS is designed to overcome the lack of native stereo vision support in commercial driving simulators, and we demonstrate its effectiveness using Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), a high-budget open-world video game engine. We introduce GTAV-TeFS, the first large-scale GTA V stereo-driving dataset, containing over 88,000 high-resolution stereo RGB image pairs, along with temporal information, GPS coordinates, camera poses, and full-resolution dense depth maps. GTAV-TeFS offers several advantages over other synthetic stereo datasets and enables the evaluation and enhancement of state-of-the-art stereo vSLAM models under GTA V's environment. We validate the quality of the stereo data collected using TeFS by conducting a comparative analysis with the conventional dual-viewport data using an open-source simulator. We also benchmark various vSLAM models using the challenging-case comparison groups included in GTAV-TeFS, revealing the distinct advantages and limitations inherent to each model. The goal of our work is to bring more high-fidelity stereo data from commercial-grade game simulators into the research domain and push the boundary of vSLAM models.</p></details> |  | None |

While this task is an essential component of many surgeries, it involves substantial human effort and is prone to inaccuracies. In this paper, we develop a novel human-AI-based method for laparoscopic measurements utilizing stereo vision that has been guided by practicing surgeons.

The developed method is assessed in various realistic experimental evaluation environments. Our results outline the potential of our method achieving high accuracies in distance measurements with errors below 1 mm. Furthermore, on-surface measurements demonstrate robustness when applied in challenging environments with textureless regions. Overall, by addressing the inherent challenges of image-guided surgery, we lay the foundation for a more robust and accurate solution for intra- and postoperative measurements, enabling more precise, safe, and efficient surgical procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-24)</p></details> | None |
| **[Diver Interest via Pointing in Three Dimensions: 3D Pointing Reconstruction for Diver-AUV Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11536v1)** | 2023-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Diver Interest via Pointing in Three Dimensions (DIP-3D), a method to relay an object of interest from a diver to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) by pointing that includes three-dimensional distance information to discriminate between multiple objects in the AUV's camera image. Traditional dense stereo vision for distance estimation underwater is challenging because of the relative lack of saliency of scene features and degraded lighting conditions. Yet, including distance information is necessary for robotic perception of diver pointing when multiple objects appear within the robot's image plane. We subvert the challenges of underwater distance estimation by using sparse reconstruction of keypoints to perform pose estimation on both the left and right images from the robot's stereo camera. Triangulated pose keypoints, along with a classical object detection method, enable DIP-3D to infer the location of an object of interest when multiple objects are in the AUV's field of view. By allowing the scuba diver to point at an arbitrary object of interest and enabling the AUV to autonomously decide which object the diver is pointing to, this method will permit more natural interaction between AUVs and human scuba divers in underwater-human robot collaborative tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review International Conference of Robotics and Automation 2024</p></details> | None |

However, limited by the imaging principles, the commonly used RGB-D cameras based on TOF, structured light, or binocular vision acquire some invalid data inevitably, such as weak reflection, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which may bring adverse impacts to the follow-up work. In this paper, we propose a new model for depth image completion based on the Attention Guided Gated-convolutional Network (AGG-Net), through which more accurate and reliable depth images can be obtained from the raw depth maps and the corresponding RGB images. Our model employs a UNet-like architecture which consists of two parallel branches of depth and color features. In the encoding stage, an Attention Guided Gated-Convolution (AG-GConv) module is proposed to realize the fusion of depth and color features at different scales, which can effectively reduce the negative impacts of invalid depth data on the reconstruction. In the decoding stage, an Attention Guided Skip Connection (AG-SC) module is presented to avoid introducing too many depth-irrelevant features to the reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the popular benchmarks NYU-Depth V2, DIML, and SUN RGB-D.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, ICCV2023</p></details> | None |
| **[Depth Estimation Analysis of Orthogonally Divergent Fisheye Cameras with Distortion Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03602v1)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo vision systems have become popular in computer vision applications, such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and autonomous navigation. However, traditional stereo vision systems that use rectilinear lenses may not be suitable for certain scenarios due to their limited field of view. This has led to the popularity of vision systems based on one or multiple fisheye cameras in different orientations, which can provide a field of view of 180x180 degrees or more. However, fisheye cameras introduce significant distortion at the edges that affects the accuracy of stereo matching and depth estimation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a method for distortion-removal and depth estimation analysis for stereovision system using orthogonally divergent fisheye cameras (ODFC). The proposed method uses two virtual pinhole cameras (VPC), each VPC captures a small portion of the original view and presents it without any lens distortions, emulating the behavior of a pinhole camera. By carefully selecting the captured regions, it is possible to create a stereo pair using two VPCs. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in both simulation using virtual environment and experiments using real cameras and their results compared to stereo cameras with parallel optical axes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of distortion removal and depth estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

A Flapping Wing Flying Robot (FWFR) can glide in favourable wind conditions, decreasing energy consumption significantly. In addition, it is also necessary to investigate the power consumption of the components in the flapping-wing robot. In this work, two sets of the FWFR components are analyzed in terms of power consumption: a) motor/electronics components and b) a vision system for monitoring the environment during the flight. A measurement device is used to record the power utilization of the motors in the launching and ascending phases of the flight and also in cruising flight around the desired height. Additionally, an analysis of event cameras and stereo vision systems in terms of energy consumption has been performed. The results provide a first step towards decreasing battery usage and, consequently, providing additional flight time.</p></details> |  | None |

Our proposed solution is based on a newly-designed panoramic stereo camera along with a hybrid novel software framework that consists of three fusion modules. The panoramic stereo camera with a pentagon shape consists of 5 stereo vision camera pairs to stream synchronized panoramic stereo images for the following three fusion modules. In the disparity fusion module, rectified stereo images produce the initial disparity maps using multiple stereo vision algorithms. Then, these initial disparity maps, along with the intensity images, are input into a disparity fusion network to produce refined disparity maps. Next, the refined disparity maps are converted into full-view point clouds or single-view point clouds for the pose fusion module. The pose fusion module adopts a two-stage global-coarse-to-local-fine strategy. In the first stage, each pair of full-view point clouds is registered by a global point cloud matching algorithm to estimate the transformation for a global pose graph's edge, which effectively implements loop closure. In the second stage, a local point cloud matching algorithm is used to match single-view point clouds in different nodes. Next, we locally refine the poses of all corresponding edges in the global pose graph using three proposed rules, thus constructing a refined pose graph. The refined pose graph is optimized to produce a global pose trajectory for volumetric fusion. In the volumetric fusion module, the global poses of all the nodes are used to integrate the single-view point clouds into the volume to produce the mesh of the whole garden. The proposed framework and its three fusion modules are tested on a real outdoor garden dataset to show the superiority of the performance.</p></details> | 32 pages | None |

While traditional methods for depth completion have relied on stereo vision or structured light techniques, recent advances in deep learning have enabled more accurate and efficient completion of depth maps from RGB images and sparse ToF measurements. To evaluate the performance of different depth completion methods, we organized an RGB+sparse ToF depth completion competition.

This study suggests a real-time overtaking assistance system that uses a combination of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm and stereo vision techniques to accurately identify and locate vehicles in front of the driver, and estimate their distance. The system then signals the vehicles behind the driver using colored lights to inform them of the safe overtaking distance. The proposed system has been implemented using Stereo vision for distance analysis and You Only Look Once (YOLO) for object identification. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in providing vehicle type and the distance between the camera module and the vehicle accurately with an approximate error of 4.107%. Our system has the potential to reduce the risk of accidents and improve the safety of overtaking maneuvers, especially on busy highways and roads.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Stereo X-ray Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13207v1)** | 2023-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray tomography is a powerful volumetric imaging technique, but detailed three dimensional (3D) imaging requires the acquisition of a large number of individual X-ray images, which is time consuming. For applications where spatial information needs to be collected quickly, for example, when studying dynamic processes, standard X-ray tomography is therefore not applicable. Inspired by stereo vision, in this paper, we develop X-ray imaging methods that work with two X-ray projection images. In this setting, without the use of additional strong prior information, we no longer have enough information to fully recover the 3D tomographic images. However, up to a point, we are nevertheless able to extract spatial locations of point and line features. From stereo vision, it is well known that, for a known imaging geometry, once the same point is identified in two images taken from different directions, then the point's location in 3D space is exactly specified. The challenge is the matching of points between images. As X-ray transmission images are fundamentally different from the surface reflection images used in standard computer vision, we here develop a different feature identification and matching approach. In fact, once point like features are identified, if there are limited points in the image, then they can often be matched exactly. In fact, by utilising a third observation from an appropriate direction, matching becomes unique. Once matched, point locations in 3D space are easily computed using geometric considerations. Linear features, with clear end points, can be located using a similar approach.</p></details> |  | None |

With the advent of COVID-19 global pandemic, there is a need to fully automate ultrasound imaging as it requires trained operators in close proximity to patients for a long period of time, therefore increasing risk of infection. In this work, we investigate the important yet seldom-studied problem of scan target localization, under the setting of lung ultrasound imaging. We propose a purely vision-based, data driven method that incorporates learning-based computer vision techniques. We combine a human pose estimation model with a specially designed regression model to predict the lung ultrasound scan targets, and deploy multiview stereo vision to enhance the consistency of 3D target localization. While related works mostly focus on phantom experiments, we collect data from 30 human subjects for testing. Our method attains an accuracy level of 16.00(9.79) mm for probe positioning and 4.44(3.75) degree for probe orientation, with a success rate above 80% under an error threshold of 25mm for all scan targets. Moreover, our approach can serve as a general solution to other types of ultrasound modalities. The code for implementation has been released.</p></details> | v2 2023/02/25 | None |

We have collected underwater forward-looking stereo-vision and visual-inertial image sets in the Mediterranean and Red Sea. To our knowledge there are no other public datasets in the underwater environment acquired with this camera-sensor orientation published with ground-truth. These datasets are critical for the development of several underwater applications, including obstacle avoidance, visual odometry, 3D tracking, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and depth estimation. The stereo datasets include synchronized stereo images in dynamic underwater environments with objects of known-size. The visual-inertial datasets contain monocular images and IMU measurements, aligned with millisecond resolution timestamps and objects of known size which were placed in the scene. Both sensor configurations allow for scale estimation, with the calibrated baseline in the stereo setup and the IMU in the visual-inertial setup. Ground truth depth maps were created offline for both dataset types using photogrammetry. The ground truth is validated with multiple known measurements placed throughout the imaged environment. There are 5 stereo and 8 visual-inertial datasets in total, each containing thousands of images, with a range of different underwater visibility and ambient light conditions, natural and man-made structures and dynamic camera motions. The forward-looking orientation of the camera makes these datasets unique and ideal for testing underwater obstacle-avoidance algorithms and for navigation close to the seafloor in dynamic environments. With our datasets, we hope to encourage the advancement of autonomous functionality for underwater vehicles in dynamic and/or shallow water environments.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome the side effects of post-surgery facial paralysis, rehabilitation requires which last for several weeks. This paper discusses an unsupervised approach to rehabilitating patients who have temporary facial paralysis due to damage in mimetic muscles. The work aims to make the rehabilitation process objective compared to the current subjective approach, such as House-Brackmann (HB) scale. Also, the approach will assist clinicians by reducing their workload in assessing the improvement during rehabilitation. This paper focuses on the clustering approach to monitor the rehabilitation process. We compare the results obtained from different clustering algorithms on various forms of the same data set, namely dynamic form, data expressed as functional data using B-spline basis expansion, and by finding the functional principal components of the functional data. The study contains data set of 85 distinct patients with 120 measurements obtained using a Kinect stereo-vision camera. The method distinguish effectively between patients with the least and greatest degree of facial paralysis, however patients with adjacent degrees of paralysis provide some challenges. In addition, we compared the cluster results to the HB scale outputs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Application of Stereo Thermal Vision for Preliminary Inspection of Electrical Power Lines by MAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04705v1)** | 2023-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An application of stereo thermal vision to perform preliminary inspection operations of electrical power lines by a particular class of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), aka Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), is presented in this paper. The proposed hardware and software setup allows the detection of overheated power equipment, one of the major causes of power outages. The stereo vision complements the GPS information by finely detecting the potential source of damage while also providing a measure of the harm extension. The reduced sizes and the light weight of the vehicle enable to survey areas otherwise difficult to access with standard UAVs. Gazebo simulations and real flight experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 15 figures, conference</p></details> | None |
