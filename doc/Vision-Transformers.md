These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and achieving high generalization in segmentation tasks. However, adapting these large models to medical image analysis presents several challenges, including domain differences between medical and natural images, the need for efficient model adaptation strategies, and the limitations of small-scale medical datasets. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on the adaptation of VFMs to medical image segmentation, focusing on the challenges of domain adaptation, model compression, and federated learning. We discuss the latest developments in adapter-based improvements, knowledge distillation techniques, and multi-scale contextual feature modeling, and propose future directions to overcome these bottlenecks. Our analysis highlights the potential of VFMs, along with emerging methodologies such as federated learning and model compression, to revolutionize medical image analysis and enhance clinical applications. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of current approaches and suggest key areas for future research that can drive the next wave of innovation in medical image segmentation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 1 figure | None |
| **[Surface Vision Mamba: Leveraging Bidirectional State Space Model for Efficient Spherical Manifold Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14679v5)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in modelling long-range dependencies on spherical cortical surfaces, surpassing traditional Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) models. However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns.

| **[Explaining the Impact of Training on Vision Models via Activation Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19700v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for vision models investigate the information extracted by their feature encoder. We contribute to this effort and propose Neuro-Activated Vision Explanations (NAVE), which extracts the information captured by the encoder by clustering the feature activations of the frozen network to be explained. The method does not aim to explain the model's prediction but to answer questions such as which parts of the image are processed similarly or which information is kept in deeper layers. Experimentally, we leverage NAVE to show that the training dataset and the level of supervision affect which concepts are captured. In addition, our method reveals the impact of registers on vision transformers (ViT) and the information saturation caused by the watermark Clever Hans effect in the training set.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Qwen2.5-VL Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13923v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Qwen2.5-VL, the latest flagship model of Qwen vision-language series, which demonstrates significant advancements in both foundational capabilities and innovative functionalities. Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs, Qwen2.5-VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding, enabling it to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations (up to hours) with second-level event localization. This allows the model to natively perceive spatial scales and temporal dynamics without relying on traditional normalization techniques. By training a native dynamic-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorporating Window Attention, we reduce computational overhead while maintaining native resolution. As a result, Qwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image and document understanding but also as an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning, tool usage, and task execution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and mobile devices. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse use cases from edge AI to high-performance computing. The flagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B model matches state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly excelling in document and diagram understanding. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL maintains robust linguistic performance, preserving the core language competencies of the Qwen2.5 LLM.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Medical Image Classification with KAN-Integrated Transformers and Dilated Neighborhood Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13693v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MobileViM: A Light-weight and Dimension-independent Vision Mamba for 3D Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13524v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in healthcare. Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible through: https://github.com/anthonyweidai/MobileViM_3D/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/anthonyweidai/MobileViM_3D) |
| **[Towards Hard and Soft Shadow Removal via Dual-Branch Separation Network and Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01864v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image shadow removal is a crucial task in computer vision. In real-world scenes, shadows alter image color and brightness, posing challenges for perception and texture recognition. Traditional and deep learning methods often overlook the distinct needs for handling hard and soft shadows, thereby lacking detailed processing to specifically address each type of shadow in images.We propose a dual-path model that processes these shadows separately using specially designed loss functions to accomplish the hard and soft shadow removal. The model classifies shadow types and processes them through appropriate paths to produce shadow-free outputs, integrating a Vision Transformer with UNet++ for enhanced edge detail and feature fusion. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves 2.905 RMSE value on the ISTD dataset, which demonstrates greater effectiveness than typical single-path approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC) 2024; Currently under review at IEEE</p></details> | None |
| **[Myna: Masking-Based Contrastive Learning of Musical Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12511v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Myna, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised musical representation learning. Built on a contrastive learning framework, Myna introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) on mel-spectrograms as the backbone and (2) a novel data augmentation strategy, token masking, that masks 90 percent of spectrogram tokens. These innovations deliver both effectiveness and efficiency: (i) Token masking enables a significant increase in per-GPU batch size, from 48 or 120 in prior methods (CLMR, MULE) to 4096. (ii) By avoiding traditional augmentations, Myna retains pitch sensitivity, enhancing performance in tasks like key detection. (iii) The use of vertical patches allows the model to better capture critical features for key detection. Our hybrid model, Myna-22M-Hybrid, processes both 16x16 and 128x2 patches, achieving state-of-the-art results. Trained on a single GPU, it outperforms MULE (62M) on average and rivals MERT-95M, which was trained on 16 and 64 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, it surpasses MERT-95M-public, establishing itself as the best-performing model trained on publicly available data. We release our code and models to promote reproducibility and facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Keyboards Using Transformers and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09782v3)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of microphones in everyday devices and the growing reliance on online services have amplified the risk of acoustic side-channel attacks (ASCAs) targeting keyboards. This study explores deep learning techniques, specifically vision transformers (VTs) and large language models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of such attacks. We present substantial improvements over prior research, with the CoAtNet model achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our CoAtNet shows a 5.0% improvement for keystrokes recorded via smartphone (Phone) and 5.9% for those recorded via Zoom compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate transformer architectures and language models, with the best VT model matching CoAtNet's performance. A key advancement is the introduction of a noise mitigation method for real-world scenarios. By using LLMs for contextual understanding, we detect and correct erroneous keystrokes in noisy environments, enhancing ASCA performance. Additionally, fine-tuned lightweight language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) deliver comparable performance to heavyweight models with 67X more parameters. This integration of VTs and LLMs improves the practical applicability of ASCA mitigation, marking the first use of these technologies to address ASCAs and error correction in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to withdraw our paper due to a significant error in the experimental methodology, which impacts the validity of our results.

| **[Spiking Vision Transformer with Saccadic Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12677v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) holds potential for achieving both energy efficiency and high performance, particularly suitable for edge vision applications. However, a significant performance gap still exists between SNN-based ViTs and their ANN counterparts. Here, we first analyze why SNN-based ViTs suffer from limited performance and identify a mismatch between the vanilla self-attention mechanism and spatio-temporal spike trains. This mismatch results in degraded spatial relevance and limited temporal interactions. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from biological saccadic attention mechanisms and introduce an innovative Saccadic Spike Self-Attention (SSSA) method. Specifically, in the spatial domain, SSSA employs a novel spike distribution-based method to effectively assess the relevance between Query and Key pairs in SNN-based ViTs. Temporally, SSSA employs a saccadic interaction module that dynamically focuses on selected visual areas at each timestep and significantly enhances whole scene understanding through temporal interactions. Building on the SSSA mechanism, we develop a SNN-based Vision Transformer (SNN-ViT). Extensive experiments across various visual tasks demonstrate that SNN-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear computational complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of the SNN-ViT highlight its potential for power-critical edge vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[DAMamba: Vision State Space Model with Dynamic Adaptive Scan](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12627v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have recently garnered significant attention in computer vision. However, due to the unique characteristics of image data, adapting SSMs from natural language processing to computer vision has not outperformed the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

| **[GVTNet: Graph Vision Transformer For Face Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12570v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in face super-resolution research have utilized the Transformer architecture. This method processes the input image into a series of small patches. However, because of the strong correlation between different facial components in facial images. When it comes to super-resolution of low-resolution images, existing algorithms cannot handle the relationships between patches well, resulting in distorted facial components in the super-resolution results. To solve the problem, we propose a transformer architecture based on graph neural networks called graph vision transformer network. We treat each patch as a graph node and establish an adjacency matrix based on the information between patches. In this way, the patch only interacts between neighboring patches, further processing the relationship of facial components. Quantitative and visualization experiments have underscored the superiority of our algorithm over state-of-the-art techniques. Through detailed comparisons, we have demonstrated that our algorithm possesses more advanced super-resolution capabilities, particularly in enhancing facial components.

| **[Multi Image Super Resolution Modeling for Earth System Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12427v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution (SR) techniques are essential for improving Earth System Model (ESM) data's spatial resolution, which helps better understand complex environmental processes. This paper presents a new algorithm, ViFOR, which combines Vision Transformers (ViT) and Implicit Neural Representation Networks (INRs) to generate High-Resolution (HR) images from Low-Resolution (LR) inputs. ViFOR introduces a novel integration of Fourier-based activation functions within the Vision Transformer architecture, enabling it to effectively capture global context and high-frequency details critical for accurate SR reconstruction. The results show that ViFOR outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as ViT, Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIREN), and SR Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) based on metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) both for global as well as the local imagery. ViFOR improves PSNR of up to 4.18 dB, 1.56 dB, and 1.73 dB over ViT for full images in the Source Temperature, Shortwave, and Longwave Flux.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OCT Data is All You Need: How Vision Transformers with and without Pre-training Benefit Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12379v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution cross-sectional images useful for diagnosing various diseases, but their distinct characteristics from natural images raise questions about whether large-scale pre-training on datasets like ImageNet is always beneficial. In this paper, we investigate the impact of ImageNet-based pre-training on Vision Transformer (ViT) performance for OCT image classification across different dataset sizes. Our experiments cover four-category retinal pathologies (CNV, DME, Drusen, Normal). Results suggest that while pre-training can accelerate convergence and potentially offer better performance in smaller datasets, training from scratch may achieve comparable or even superior accuracy when sufficient OCT data is available. Our findings highlight the importance of matching domain characteristics in pre-training and call for further study on large-scale OCT-specific pre-training.</p></details> |  | None |

With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space. The experimental results on the Janelia dataset of the BigNeuron project demonstrate that our method achieves a segmentation performance improvement of 4.53% in mean Dice and 3.56% in mean 95% Hausdorff distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, and 2 tables.

| **[Compress image to patches for Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10120v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has made significant strides in the field of computer vision. However, as the depth of the model and the resolution of the input images increase, the computational cost associated with training and running ViT models has surged dramatically. This paper proposes a hybrid model based on CNN and Vision Transformer, named CI2P-ViT. The model incorporates a module called CI2P, which utilizes the CompressAI encoder to compress images and subsequently generates a sequence of patches through a series of convolutions. CI2P can replace the Patch Embedding component in the ViT model, enabling seamless integration into existing ViT models. Compared to ViT-B/16, CI2P-ViT has the number of patches input to the self-attention layer reduced to a quarter of the original. This design not only significantly reduces the computational cost of the ViT model but also effectively enhances the model's accuracy by introducing the inductive bias properties of CNN. The ViT model's precision is markedly enhanced. When trained from the ground up on the Animals-10 dataset, CI2P-ViT achieved an accuracy rate of 92.37%, representing a 3.3% improvement over the ViT-B/16 baseline. Additionally, the model's computational operations, measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPs), were diminished by 63.35%, and it exhibited a 2-fold increase in training velocity on identical hardware configurations.</p></details> | 15 pages,5 figures | None |

Given the high performance and reconfigurability, FPGA-based accelerators for MoE-ViT emerge, delivering substantial gains over general-purpose processors. However, existing accelerators often fall short of fully exploring the design space, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between resource utilization and performance. To overcome this problem, we introduce UbiMoE, a novel end-to-end FPGA accelerator tailored for MoE-ViT. Leveraging the unique computational and memory access patterns of MoE-ViTs, we develop a latency-optimized streaming attention kernel and a resource-efficient reusable linear kernel, effectively balancing performance and resource consumption. To further enhance design efficiency, we propose a two-stage heuristic search algorithm that optimally tunes hardware parameters for various FPGA resource constraints. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) FPGA designs, UbiMoE achieves 1.34x and 3.35x throughput improvements for MoE-ViT on Xilinx ZCU102 and Alveo U280 platforms, respectively, while enhancing energy efficiency by 1.75x and 1.54x.

| **[Neural Slot Interpreters: Grounding Object Semantics in Emergent Slot Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07887v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several accounts of human cognition posit that our intelligence is rooted in our ability to form abstract composable concepts, ground them in our environment, and reason over these grounded entities. This trifecta of human thought has remained elusive in modern intelligent machines. In this work, we investigate whether slot representations extracted from visual scenes serve as appropriate compositional abstractions for grounding and reasoning. We present the Neural Slot Interpreter (NSI), which learns to ground object semantics in slots. At the core of NSI is an XML-like schema that uses simple syntax rules to organize the object semantics of a scene into object-centric schema primitives. Then, the NSI metric learns to ground primitives into slots through a structured contrastive learning objective that reasons over the intermodal alignment. Experiments with a bi-modal object-property and scene retrieval task demonstrate the grounding efficacy and interpretability of correspondences learned by NSI. From a scene representation standpoint, we find that emergent NSI slots that move beyond the image grid by binding to spatial objects facilitate improved visual grounding compared to conventional bounding-box-based approaches. From a data efficiency standpoint, we empirically validate that NSI learns more generalizable representations from a fixed amount of annotation data than the traditional approach. We also show that the grounded slots surpass unsupervised slots in real-world object discovery and scale with scene complexity. Finally, we investigate the reasoning abilities of the grounded slots. Vision Transformers trained on grounding-aware NSI tokenizers using as few as ten tokens outperform patch-based tokens on challenging few-shot classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

An under-explored question of PEFT is in extending the pre-training phase without supervised labels; that is, can we adapt a pre-trained foundation model to a new domain via efficient self-supervised pre-training on this new domain? In this work, we introduce ExPLoRA, a highly effective technique to improve transfer learning of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) under domain shifts. Initializing a ViT with pre-trained weights on large, natural-image datasets such as from DinoV2 or MAE, ExPLoRA continues the unsupervised pre-training objective on a new domain, unfreezing 1-2 pre-trained ViT blocks and tuning all other layers with LoRA. We then fine-tune the resulting model only with LoRA on this new domain for supervised learning. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on satellite imagery, even outperforming fully pre-training and fine-tuning ViTs. Using the DinoV2 training objective, we demonstrate up to 8% improvement in linear probing top-1 accuracy on downstream tasks while using <10% of the number of parameters that are used in prior fully-tuned state-of-the art approaches. Our ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our approach over other baselines, including PEFT and unfreezing more ViT blocks.

Prevailing face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches generally concentrate on the single-frame scenario, however, purely photometric-driven methods overlook the dynamic spoofing clues that may be exposed over time. This may lead FAS systems to conclude incorrect judgments, especially in cases where it is easily distinguishable in terms of dynamics but challenging to discern in terms of photometrics. To this end, we propose the Graph Guided Video Vision Transformer (G$^2$V$^2$former), which combines faces with facial landmarks for photometric and dynamic feature fusion. We factorize the attention into space and time, and fuse them via a spatiotemporal block. Specifically, we design a novel temporal attention called Kronecker temporal attention, which has a wider receptive field, and is beneficial for capturing dynamic information. Moreover, we leverage the low-semantic motion of facial landmarks to guide the high-semantic change of facial expressions based on the motivation that regions containing landmarks may reveal more dynamic clues. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance under various scenarios. The codes will be released soon.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

Various architectures, from vision transformers (ViTs) to convolutional networks (ResNets) have been trained with CLIP to serve as general solutions to diverse vision tasks. This paper explores the differences across various CLIP-trained vision backbones. Despite using the same data and training objective, we find that these architectures have notably different representations, different classification performance across datasets, and different robustness properties to certain types of image perturbations. Our findings indicate a remarkable possible synergy across backbones by leveraging their respective strengths. In principle, classification accuracy could be improved by over 40 percentage with an informed selection of the optimal backbone per test example.Using this insight, we develop a straightforward yet powerful approach to adaptively ensemble multiple backbones. The approach uses as few as one labeled example per class to tune the adaptive combination of backbones. On a large collection of datasets, the method achieves a remarkable increase in accuracy of up to 39.1% over the best single backbone, well beyond traditional ensembles</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.14400</p></details> | None |

We propose a Recurrent Vision Transformer (Recurrent ViT) that integrates self-attention with recurrent memory, allowing both current inputs and stored information to guide attention allocation. Trained solely via sparse reward feedback on a spatially cued orientation change detection task, a paradigm used in primate studies, our model exhibits primate like signatures of attention, including improved accuracy and faster responses for cued stimuli that scale with cue validity. Analysis of self-attention maps reveals dynamic spatial prioritization with reactivation prior to expected changes, and targeted perturbations produce performance shifts similar to those observed in primate frontal eye fields and superior colliculus. These findings demonstrate that incorporating recurrent feedback into self attention can capture key aspects of primate visual attention.</p></details> |  | None |

This is usually performed by measuring the crown-rump-length (CRL) on an ultrasound image in the Dating scan which is then correlated with fetal age and growth trajectory. A major issue when performing the CRL measurement is ensuring that the image is acquired at the correct view, otherwise it could be misleading. Although clinical guidelines specify the criteria for the correct CRL view, sonographers may not regularly adhere to such rules. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based solution that is able to verify the adherence of a CRL image to clinical guidelines in order to assess image quality and facilitate accurate estimation of GA. We first segment out important fetal structures then use the localized structures to perform a clinically-guided mapping that verifies the adherence of criteria. The segmentation method combines the benefits of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Vision Transformer (ViT) to segment fetal structures in ultrasound images and localize important fetal landmarks. For segmentation purposes, we compare our proposed work with UNet and show that our CNN/ViT-based method outperforms an optimized version of UNet. Furthermore, we compare the output of the mapping with classification CNNs when assessing the clinical criteria and the overall acceptability of CRL images. We show that the proposed mapping is not only explainable but also more accurate than the best performing classification CNNs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures | None |

Addressing these challenges, this study presents a refined, comprehensive strategy leveraging advanced deep-learning techniques for the classification of leukemia subtypes. We commence by developing a hierarchical label taxonomy, paving the way for differentiating between various subtypes of leukemia. The research further introduces a novel hierarchical approach inspired by clinical procedures capable of accurately classifying diverse types of leukemia alongside reactive and healthy cells. An integral part of this study involves a meticulous examination of the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) as classifiers. The proposed method exhibits an impressive success rate, achieving approximately 90\% accuracy across all leukemia subtypes, as substantiated by our experimental results. A visual representation of the experimental findings is provided to enhance the model's explainability and aid in understanding the classification process.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures | None |

While existing methods treat parameters as vectors, they overlook the intrinsic structure of linear transformation matrices - the core components that comprise the majority of model parameters. These matrices are fundamental to neural networks, mapping input representations to output features through linear combinations. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we introduce task matrix and propose to Superpose Features from Task Matrix (SFTM), a novel approach that superposes features from individual task models into a merged model. SFTM employs singular value decomposition to identify feature bases of linear transformation matrices and solves a linear system to optimally combine them while preserving input-output mappings from individual task models. Extensive experiments on vision transformers and language models demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance and enhanced out-of-distribution generalization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures | None |

Here we introduce the Continuous Vision Transformer (CViT), a novel neural operator architecture that leverages advances in computer vision to address challenges in learning complex physical systems. CViT combines a vision transformer encoder, a novel grid-based coordinate embedding, and a query-wise cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. This design allows for flexible output representations and consistent evaluation at arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate CViT's effectiveness across a diverse range of partial differential equation (PDE) systems, including fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and reaction-diffusion processes. Our comprehensive experiments show that CViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, often surpassing larger foundation models, even without extensive pretraining and roll-out fine-tuning. Taken together, CViT exhibits robust handling of discontinuous solutions, multi-scale features, and intricate spatio-temporal dynamics. Our contributions can be viewed as a significant step towards adapting advanced computer vision architectures for building more flexible and accurate machine learning models in the physical sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 tables, 19figures</p></details> | None |

Weakly-supervised learning, which allows less precise labels, has become a promising solution to this challenge. Building on this approach, we propose QMaxViT-Unet+, a novel framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation. This framework is built on the U-Net architecture, with the encoder and decoder replaced by Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) blocks. These blocks enhance the model's ability to learn local and global features efficiently. Additionally, our approach integrates a query-based Transformer decoder to refine features and an edge enhancement module to compensate for the limited boundary information in the scribble label. We evaluate the proposed QMaxViT-Unet+ on four public datasets focused on cardiac structures, colorectal polyps, and breast cancer: ACDC, MS-CMRSeg, SUN-SEG, and BUSI. Evaluation metrics include the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95). Experimental results show that QMaxViT-Unet+ achieves 89.1\% DSC and 1.316mm HD95 on ACDC, 88.4\% DSC and 2.226mm HD95 on MS-CMRSeg, 71.4\% DSC and 4.996mm HD95 on SUN-SEG, and 69.4\% DSC and 50.122mm HD95 on BUSI. These results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency while remaining competitive with fully-supervised learning approaches. This makes it ideal for medical image analysis, where high-quality annotations are often scarce and require significant effort and expense.

Since ViTs are computationally expensive, the models either have to be pruned to run on resource-limited edge devices only or have to be executed on remote cloud servers after receiving the raw data transmitted over fluctuating networks. The resulting degraded performance or high latency all hinder their widespread applications. In this paper, we present Janus, the first framework for low-latency cloud-device collaborative Vision Transformer inference over dynamic networks. Janus overcomes the intrinsic model limitations of ViTs and realizes collaboratively executing ViT models on both cloud and edge devices, achieving low latency, high accuracy, and low communication overhead. Specifically, Janus judiciously combines token pruning techniques with a carefully designed fine-to-coarse model splitting policy and non-static mixed pruning policy. It attains a balance between accuracy and latency by dynamically selecting the optimal pruning level and split point. Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate that Janus enhances throughput by up to 5.15 times and reduces latency violation ratios by up to 98.7% when compared with baseline approaches under various network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE INFOCOM 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[One Leaf Reveals the Season: Occlusion-Based Contrastive Learning with Semantic-Aware Views for Efficient Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09858v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a scalable and straightforward pre-training paradigm for efficient visual conceptual representation called occluded image contrastive learning (OCL). Our OCL approach is simple: we randomly mask patches to generate different views within an image and contrast them among a mini-batch of images. The core idea behind OCL consists of two designs. First, masked tokens have the potential to significantly diminish the conceptual redundancy inherent in images, and create distinct views with substantial fine-grained differences on the semantic concept level instead of the instance level. Second, contrastive learning is adept at extracting high-level semantic conceptual features during the pre-training, circumventing the high-frequency interference and additional costs associated with image reconstruction. Importantly, OCL learns highly semantic conceptual representations efficiently without relying on hand-crafted data augmentations or additional auxiliary modules. Empirically, OCL demonstrates high scalability with Vision Transformers, as the ViT-L/16 can complete pre-training in 133 hours using only 4 A100 GPUs, achieving 85.8\% accuracy in downstream fine-tuning tasks.

MedMimic is introduced as a multimodal framework inspired by real-world diagnostic processes. It uses pretrained models such as DINOv2, Vision Transformer, and ResNet-18 to convert high-dimensional 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging into low-dimensional, semantically meaningful features. A learnable self-attention-based fusion network then integrates these imaging features with clinical data for classification. Using 416 FUO patient cases from Sichuan University West China Hospital from 2017 to 2023, the multimodal fusion classification network MFCN achieved macro-AUROC scores ranging from 0.8654 to 0.9291 across seven tasks, outperforming conventional machine learning and single-modality deep learning methods. Ablation studies and five-fold cross-validation further validated its effectiveness. By combining the strengths of pretrained large models and deep learning, MedMimic offers a promising solution for disease classification.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Heuristical Comparison of Vision Transformers Against Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09101v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently brought a new wave of research in the field of computer vision. These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT.

This phenomenon is prevalent across various machine learning applications, including vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where models may find unintended cues that minimize training loss but fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Vision classifiers such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are positionally correlated with class labels, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features. We perform both quantitative evaluation by training on the shortcut-modified dataset and testing them on two different test sets -- one containing the same shortcuts and another without them -- to determine the extent of reliance on shortcuts. Additionally, qualitative evaluation is performed by using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques to analyze what the models internalize in their weights, aiming to reconstruct the training data as perceived by the classifiers. We evaluate shortcut learning behavior across multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10, to compare the susceptibility of different vision classifier architectures to shortcut reliance and assess their varying degrees of sensitivity to spurious correlations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, T2V generation still faces two important challenges: 1) Lacking a precise open sourced high-quality dataset. The previous popular video datasets, e.g. WebVid-10M and Panda-70M, are either with low quality or too large for most research institutions. Therefore, it is challenging but crucial to collect a precise high-quality text-video pairs for T2V generation. 2) Ignoring to fully utilize textual information. Recent T2V methods have focused on vision transformers, using a simple cross attention module for video generation, which falls short of thoroughly extracting semantic information from text prompt. To address these issues, we introduce OpenVid-1M, a precise high-quality dataset with expressive captions. This open-scenario dataset contains over 1 million text-video pairs, facilitating research on T2V generation. Furthermore, we curate 433K 1080p videos from OpenVid-1M to create OpenVidHD-0.4M, advancing high-definition video generation. Additionally, we propose a novel Multi-modal Video Diffusion Transformer (MVDiT) capable of mining both structure information from visual tokens and semantic information from text tokens. Extensive experiments and ablation studies verify the superiority of OpenVid-1M over previous datasets and the effectiveness of our MVDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures, Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Residual Transformer Fusion Network for Salt and Pepper Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09000v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used in unstructured datasets, one of which is image denoising. Image denoising is a noisy image reconstruction process that aims to reduce additional noise that occurs from the noisy image with various strategies. Image denoising has a problem, namely that some image denoising methods require some prior knowledge of information about noise. To overcome this problem, a combined architecture of Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) and Residual Networks (ResNet) is used which is called the Residual Transformer Fusion Network (RTF-Net). In general, the process in this architecture can be divided into two parts, Noise Suppression Network (NSN) and Structure Enhancement Network (SEN). Residual Block is used in the Noise Suppression Network and is used to learn the noise map in the image, while the CvT is used in the Structure Enhancement Network and is used to learn the details that need to be added to the image processed by the Noise Suppression Network. The model was trained using the DIV2K Training Set dataset, and validation using the DIV2K Validation Set. After doing the training, the model was tested using Lena, Bridge, Pepper, and BSD300 images with noise levels ranging from 30%, 50%, and 70% and the PSNR results were compared with the DBA, NASNLM, PARIGI, NLSF, NLSF-MLP and NLSF-CNN methods. The test results show that the proposed method is superior in all cases except for Pepper's image with a noise level of 30%, where NLSF-CNN is superior with a PSNR value of 32.99 dB, while the proposed method gets a PSNR value of 31.70 dB.</p></details> | 8 pages, 17 figures | None |

Vision Transformers have mainly been limited to attention extraction to provide insight into the model's reasoning. Our approach combines the high performance of Vision Transformers with the introduction of new explainability capabilities. We present HierViT, a Vision Transformer that is inherently interpretable and adapts its reasoning to that of humans. A hierarchical structure is used to process domain-specific features for prediction. It is interpretable by design, as it derives the target output with human-defined features that are visualized by exemplary images (prototypes). By incorporating domain knowledge about these decisive features, the reasoning is semantically similar to human reasoning and therefore intuitive. Moreover, attention heatmaps visualize the crucial regions for identifying each feature, thereby providing HierViT with a versatile tool for validating predictions. Evaluated on two medical benchmark datasets, LIDC-IDRI for lung nodule assessment and derm7pt for skin lesion classification, HierViT achieves superior and comparable prediction accuracy, respectively, while offering explanations that align with human reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the method of choice in vision applications and have shown excellent potential in automatic classification of US images. Despite their success, their restricted local receptive field limits their ability to learn global context information. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) designs that are based on self-attention between image patches have shown great potential to be an alternative to CNNs. In this study, for the first time, we utilize ViT to classify breast US images using different augmentation strategies. The results are provided as classification accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics, and the performance is compared with the state-of-the-art CNNs.

Transformers originated from machine translation and are particularly good at modelling long-range dependencies within a long sequence. Although the global interaction between the token embeddings could be well modelled by the self-attention mechanism of transformers, what is lacking is a locality mechanism for information exchange within a local region. In this paper, locality mechanism is systematically investigated by carefully designed controlled experiments. We add locality to vision transformers into the feed-forward network. This seemingly simple solution is inspired by the comparison between feed-forward networks and inverted residual blocks. The importance of locality mechanisms is validated in two ways: 1) A wide range of design choices (activation function, layer placement, expansion ratio) are available for incorporating locality mechanisms and proper choices can lead to a performance gain over the baseline, and 2) The same locality mechanism is successfully applied to vision transformers with different architecture designs, which shows the generalization of the locality concept. For ImageNet2012 classification, the locality-enhanced transformers outperform the baselines Swin-T, DeiT-T, and PVT-T by 1.0%, 2.6% and 3.1% with a negligible increase in the number of parameters and computational effort.

Pre-training Vision Transformer (ViT) through masked image modeling (MIM) on large-scale unlabeled medical datasets presents a promising solution, providing both computational efficiency and model generalization for various downstream tasks. However, current ViT-based MIM pre-training frameworks predominantly emphasize local aggregation representations in output layers and fail to exploit the rich representations across different ViT layers that better capture fine-grained semantic information needed for more precise medical downstream tasks. To fill the above gap, we hereby present Hierarchical Encoder-driven MAE (Hi-End-MAE), a simple yet effective ViT-based pre-training solution, which centers on two key innovations: (1) Encoder-driven reconstruction, which encourages the encoder to learn more informative features to guide the reconstruction of masked patches; and (2) Hierarchical dense decoding, which implements a hierarchical decoding structure to capture rich representations across different layers. We pre-train Hi-End-MAE on a large-scale dataset of 10K CT scans and evaluated its performance across seven public medical image segmentation benchmarks.

However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents a critical challenge for deployment in robust applications. This paper addresses the critical question of how to incorporate robustness into MoEs while maintaining high natural accuracy. We begin by analyzing the vulnerability of MoE components, finding that expert networks are notably more susceptible to adversarial attacks than the router. Based on this insight, we propose a targeted robust training technique that integrates a novel loss function to enhance the adversarial robustness of MoE, requiring only the robustification of one additional expert without compromising training or inference efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a dual-model strategy that linearly combines a standard MoE model with our robustified MoE model using a smoothing parameter. This approach allows for flexible control over the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We further provide theoretical foundations by deriving certified robustness bounds for both the single MoE and the dual-model. To push the boundaries of robustness and accuracy, we propose a novel joint training strategy JTDMoE for the dual-model. This joint training enhances both robustness and accuracy beyond what is achievable with separate models. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ICML 2025 (under review)</p></details> | None |

The ESMs are highly complex, and thus, deep neural network architectures are used to model the complexity and store the down-sampled data. In this paper, we propose the Vision Transformer Sinusoidal Representation Networks (ViSIR) to improve the single image SR (SR) reconstruction task for the ESM data. Methods: ViSIR combines the SR capability of Vision Transformers (ViT) with the high-frequency detail preservation of the Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to address the spectral bias observed in SR tasks.

A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade plasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma scenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental machines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically is extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge, making it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies. In this work, we propose a method for training neural surrogates for 5D gyrokinetic simulations. Our method extends a hierarchical vision transformer to five dimensions and is trained on the 5D distribution function for the adiabatic electron approximation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately infer downstream physical quantities such as heat flux time trace and electrostatic potentials for single-step predictions two orders of magnitude faster than numerical codes. Our work paves the way towards neural surrogates for plasma turbulence simulations to accelerate deployment of commercial energy production via nuclear fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (+ references and appendix)</p></details> | None |

The driving scene perception system fundamentally represents an object detection task that requires achieving a balance between accuracy and processing speed. Many contemporary methods focus on improving detection accuracy but often overlook the importance of real-time detection capabilities when computational resources are limited.

This paper introduces Fast-COS, a novel single-stage object detection framework crafted specifically for driving scene applications. The research initiates with an analysis of the backbone, considering both macro and micro architectural designs, yielding the Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer (RAViT). RAViT utilizes Reparameterized Multi-Scale Depth-Wise Convolution (RepMSDW) and Reparameterized Self-Attention (RepSA) to enhance computational efficiency and feature extraction. In extensive tests across GPU, edge, and mobile platforms, RAViT achieves 81.4% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset, demonstrating significant throughput improvements over comparable backbone models such as ResNet, FastViT, RepViT, and EfficientFormer. Additionally, integrating RepMSDW into a feature pyramid network forms RepFPN, enabling fast and multi-scale feature fusion. Fast-COS enhances object detection in driving scenes, attaining an AP50 score of 57.2% on the BDD100K dataset and 80.0% on the TJU-DHD Traffic dataset. It surpasses leading models in efficiency, delivering up to 75.9% faster GPU inference and 1.38 higher throughput on edge devices compared to FCOS, YOLOF, and RetinaNet. These findings establish Fast-COS as a highly scalable and reliable solution suitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-limited environments like autonomous driving systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review on IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> | None |
| **[SparseFormer: Detecting Objects in HRW Shots via Sparse Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07216v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen an increase in the use of gigapixel-level image and video capture systems and benchmarks with high-resolution wide (HRW) shots. However, unlike close-up shots in the MS COCO dataset, the higher resolution and wider field of view raise unique challenges, such as extreme sparsity and huge scale changes, causing existing close-up detectors inaccuracy and inefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic sparse vision transformer, dubbed SparseFormer, to bridge the gap of object detection between close-up and HRW shots. The proposed SparseFormer selectively uses attentive tokens to scrutinize the sparsely distributed windows that may contain objects. In this way, it can jointly explore global and local attention by fusing coarse- and fine-grained features to handle huge scale changes. SparseFormer also benefits from a novel Cross-slice non-maximum suppression (C-NMS) algorithm to precisely localize objects from noisy windows and a simple yet effective multi-scale strategy to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments on two HRW benchmarks, PANDA and DOTA-v1.0, demonstrate that the proposed SparseFormer significantly improves detection accuracy (up to 5.8%) and speed (up to 3x) over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ACM MM 2024</p></details> | None |

However, internal defects such as porosity and cracks can compromise mechanical properties and overall performance. This study focuses on in-situ monitoring and characterization of melt pools associated with porosity, aiming to improve defect detection and quality control in DED-printed parts. Traditional machine learning approaches for defect identification rely on extensive labeled datasets, often scarce and expensive to generate in real-world manufacturing. To address this, our framework employs self-supervised learning on unlabeled melt pool data using a Vision Transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to produce highly representative embeddings. These fine-tuned embeddings are leveraged via transfer learning to train classifiers on a limited labeled dataset, enabling the effective identification of melt pool anomalies. We evaluate two classifiers: (1) a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier utilizing the fine-tuned MAE Encoder's parameters and (2) the fine-tuned MAE Encoder combined with an MLP classifier head. Our framework achieves overall accuracy ranging from 95.44% to 99.17% and an average F1 score exceeding 80%, with the ViT Classifier slightly outperforming the MAE Encoder Classifier. This demonstrates the scalability and cost-effectiveness of our approach for automated quality control in DED, effectively detecting defects with minimal labeled data.</p></details> |  | None |

For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

Unlike short-term re-identification systems that rely on temporary features (e.g., clothing), we focus on learning persistent body shape characteristics that remain stable over time. We introduce a body identification model based on a Vision Transformer (ViT) (Body Identification from Diverse Datasets, BIDDS) and on a Swin-ViT model (Swin-BIDDS). We also expand on previous approaches based on the Linguistic and Non-linguistic Core ResNet Identity Models (LCRIM and NLCRIM), but with improved training. All models are trained on a large and diverse dataset of over 1.9 million images of approximately 5k identities across 9 databases. Performance was evaluated on standard re-identification benchmark datasets (MARS, MSMT17, Outdoor Gait, DeepChange) and on an unconstrained dataset that includes images at a distance (from close-range to 1000m), at altitude (from an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV), and with clothing change. A comparative analysis across these models provides insights into how different backbone architectures and input image sizes impact long-term body identification performance across real-world conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Demystifying Singular Defects in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07004v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large transformer models are known to produce high-norm tokens. In vision transformers (ViTs), such tokens have been mathematically modeled through the singular vectors of the linear approximations of layers. However, in large language models (LLMs), the underlying causes of high-norm tokens remain largely unexplored, and their different properties from those of ViTs require a new analysis framework. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical validation across a range of recent models, leading to the following observations: i) The layer-wise singular direction predicts the abrupt explosion of token norms in LLMs. ii) The negative eigenvalues of a layer explain its sudden decay. iii) The computational pathways leading to high-norm tokens differ between initial and noninitial tokens. iv) High-norm tokens are triggered by the right leading singular vector of the matrix approximating the corresponding modules. We showcase two practical applications of these findings: the improvement of quantization schemes and the design of LLM signatures. Our findings not only advance the understanding of singular defects in LLMs but also open new avenues for their application. We expect that this work will stimulate further research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and will therefore publicly release our code.</p></details> |  | None |

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides the highest expressivity in ischemic stroke but poses substantial challenges for automated lesion segmentation: susceptibility artefacts, morphological heterogeneity, age-related comorbidities, time-dependent signal dynamics, instrumental variability, and limited labelled data. Current U-Net-based models therefore underperform, a problem accentuated by inadequate evaluation metrics that focus on mean performance, neglecting anatomical, subpopulation, and acquisition-dependent variability. Here, we present a high-performance DWI lesion segmentation tool addressing these challenges through optimized vision transformer-based architectures, integration of 3563 annotated lesions from multi-site data, and algorithmic enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art results. We further propose a novel evaluative framework assessing model fidelity, equity (across demographics and lesion subtypes), anatomical precision, and robustness to instrumental variability, promoting clinical and research utility. This work advances stroke imaging by reconciling model expressivity with domain-specific challenges and redefining performance benchmarks to prioritize equity and generalizability, critical for personalized medicine and mechanistic research.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, 1 supplementary table, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> | None |

As models are continually scaled up to improve performance, a rigorous understanding of SAM's scaling behaviour is paramount. To this end, we study the infinite-width limit of neural networks trained with SAM, using the Tensor Programs framework. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of standard SAM effectively reduce to applying SAM solely in the last layer in wide neural networks, even with optimal hyperparameters. In contrast, we identify a stable parameterization with layerwise perturbation scaling, which we call $\textit{Maximal Update and Perturbation Parameterization}$ ($\mu$P$^2$), that ensures all layers are both feature learning and effectively perturbed in the limit. Through experiments with MLPs, ResNets and Vision Transformers, we empirically demonstrate that $\mu$P$^2$ achieves hyperparameter transfer of the joint optimum of learning rate and perturbation radius across model scales. Moreover, we provide an intuitive condition to derive $\mu$P$^2$ for other perturbation rules like Adaptive SAM and SAM-ON, also ensuring balanced perturbation effects across all layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready version.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue by updating only a small subset of model parameters using adapter modules. In this work, we propose \emph{Quantum-Inspired Adapters}, a PEFT approach inspired by Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits from quantum machine learning literature. These models can be both expressive and parameter-efficient by operating in a combinatorially large space while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in weight parameters. We test our proposed adapters by adapting large language models and large vision transformers on benchmark datasets. Our method can achieve 99.2\% of the performance of existing fine-tuning methods such LoRA with a 44x parameter compression on language understanding datasets like GLUE and VTAB. Compared to existing orthogonal fine-tuning methods such as OFT or BOFT, we achieve 98\% relative performance with 25x fewer parameters. This demonstrates competitive performance paired with a significant reduction in trainable parameters. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that Quantum-Inspired Adapters offer a promising direction for efficient adaptation of language and vision models in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Despite their success in tasks focused solely on RGB images, the potential of VFMs in RGB-depth driving scene parsing remains largely under-explored. In this article, we take one step toward this emerging research area by investigating a feasible technique to fully exploit VFMs for generalizable RGB-depth driving scene parsing. Specifically, we explore the inherent characteristics of RGB and depth data, thereby presenting a Heterogeneous Feature Integration Transformer (HFIT). This network enables the efficient extraction and integration of comprehensive heterogeneous features without re-training ViTs. Relative depth prediction results from VFMs, used as inputs to the HFIT side adapter, overcome the limitations of the dependence on depth maps. Our proposed HFIT demonstrates superior performance compared to all other traditional single-modal and data-fusion scene parsing networks, pre-trained VFMs, and ViT adapters on the Cityscapes and KITTI Semantics datasets. We believe this novel strategy paves the way for future innovations in VFM-based data-fusion techniques for driving scene parsing.

Yet, efficiently adapting them for multiple tasks remains a challenge that arises from the need to modify the rich hidden representations encoded by the learned weight matrices, without inducing interference between tasks. Current parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, which apply low-rank updates, force tasks to compete within constrained subspaces, ultimately degrading performance. We introduce DiTASK a novel Diffeomorphic Multi-Task Fine-Tuning approach that maintains pre-trained representations by preserving weight matrix singular vectors, while enabling task-specific adaptations through neural diffeomorphic transformations of the singular values. By following this approach, DiTASK enables both shared and task-specific feature modulations with minimal added parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that DITASK achieves full-rank updates during optimization, preserving the geometric structure of pre-trained features, and establishing a new paradigm for efficient multi-task learning (MTL). Our experiments on PASCAL MTL and NYUD show that DiTASK achieves state-of-the-art performance across four dense prediction tasks, using 75% fewer parameters than existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, cvpr template</p></details> | None |

However, many hydrologic models are computationally expensive and, depending on the resolution and scale, simulations can take on the order of hours to days to complete. While techniques such as uncertainty quantification and optimization have become valuable tools for supporting management decisions, these analyses typically require hundreds of model simulations, which are too computationally expensive to perform with a process-based hydrologic model. To address this gap, we assess a hybrid modeling workflow in which a process-based model is used to generate an initial set of simulations and a machine learning (ML) surrogate model is then trained to perform the remaining simulations required for downstream analysis. As a case study, we apply this workflow to simulations of variably saturated groundwater flow at a prospective managed aquifer recharge site. We compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of several ML architectures, including deep convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, vision transformers, and networks with Fourier transforms. Our results demonstrate that ML surrogate models can achieve under 10% mean absolute percentage error and yield order-of-magnitude runtime savings over process-based models. Building on these findings, we examine the impacts of key modeling choices on surrogate model accuracy and efficiency. Results show that a normalized loss function improves training stability, while min-max data normalization can significantly reduce error up to a factor of 10 when compared to other treatments such as Z-score and no normalization.

This paper presents MicroViT, a lightweight Vision Transformer architecture optimized for edge devices by significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. The core of MicroViT is the Efficient Single Head Attention (ESHA) mechanism, which utilizes group convolution to reduce feature redundancy and processes only a fraction of the channels, thus lowering the burden of the self-attention mechanism. MicroViT is designed using a multi-stage MetaFormer architecture, stacking multiple MicroViT encoders to enhance efficiency and performance. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet-1K and COCO datasets demonstrate that MicroViT achieves competitive accuracy while significantly improving 3.6 faster inference speed and reducing energy consumption with 40% higher efficiency than the MobileViT series, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile and edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Beyond 2:4: exploring V:N:M sparsity for efficient transformer inference on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16135v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, 2:4 sparsity has stood as the only sparse pattern that can be accelerated using sparse tensor cores on GPUs. In practice, 2:4 sparsity often possesses low actual speedups ($\leq 1.3$) and requires fixed sparse ratios, meaning that other ratios, such as 4:8, 8:16, or those exceeding 50% sparsity, do not incur any speedups on GPUs. Recent studies suggest that V:N:M sparsity is promising in addressing these limitations of 2:4 sparsity. However, regarding accuracy, the effects of V:N:M sparsity on broader Transformer models, such as vision Transformers and large language models (LLMs), are largely unexamined. Moreover, Some specific issues related to V:N:M sparsity, such as how to select appropriate V and M values, remain unresolved. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the application of V:N:M sparsity in vision models and LLMs across multiple tasks, from pertaining to downstream tasks. We propose three key approaches to enhance the applicability and accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers, including heuristic V and M selection, V:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training techniques. Experimental results show that, with our methods, the DeiT-small achieves lossless accuracy at 64:2:5 sparsity, while the DeiT-base maintains accuracy even at 64:2:8 sparsity. In addition, the fine-tuned LLama2-7B at 64:2:5 sparsity performs comparably or better than training-free 2:4 sparse alternatives on downstream tasks. More importantly, V:N:M-sparse Transformers offer a wider range of speedup-accuracy trade-offs compared to 2:4 sparsity. Overall, our exploration largely facilitates the V:N:M sparsity to act as a truly effective acceleration solution for Transformers in cost-sensitive inference scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Representative posts nearest to each cluster centroid provide insights into the composition and characteristics of the clusters. While the results highlight the strengths of ViT in isolating visual patterns, challenges such as overlapping clusters and outliers underscore the limitations of single-modal approaches in this domain.

In particular, we attempt to address the following questions in a mathematically principled way: i) Where to add a new capacity (layer) during the training process? ii) How to initialize the new capacity? At the heart of our approach are two key ingredients: i) the introduction of a ``shape functional" to be minimized, which depends on neural network topology, and ii) the introduction of a topological derivative of the shape functional with respect to the neural network topology. Using an optimal control viewpoint, we show that the network topological derivative exists under certain conditions, and its closed-form expression is derived. In particular, we explore, for the first time, the connection between the topological derivative from a topology optimization framework with the Hamiltonian from optimal control theory. Further, we show that the optimality condition for the shape functional leads to an eigenvalue problem for deep neural architecture adaptation. Our approach thus determines the most sensitive location along the depth where a new layer needs to be inserted during the training phase and the associated parametric initialization for the newly added layer. We also demonstrate that our layer insertion strategy can be derived from an optimal transport viewpoint as a solution to maximizing a topological derivative in $p$-Wasserstein space, where $p>= 1$. Numerical investigations with fully connected network, convolutional neural network, and vision transformer on various regression and classification problems demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform an ad-hoc baseline network and other architecture adaptation strategies. Further, we also demonstrate other applications of topological derivative in fields such as transfer learning.</p></details> |  | None |

This work evaluates the performance of Vision Transformers architectures, including Swin Transformer and MaxViT, in several datasets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. We used three training sets of images with brain, lung, and kidney tumors. Each dataset includes different classification labels, from brain gliomas and meningiomas to benign and malignant lung conditions and kidney anomalies such as cysts and cancers. This work aims to analyze the behavior of the neural networks in each dataset and the benefits of combining different image modalities and tumor classes. We designed several experiments by fine-tuning the models on combined and individual image modalities. The results revealed that the Swin Transformer provided high accuracy, achieving up to 99.9\% for kidney tumor classification and 99.3\% accuracy in a combined dataset. MaxViT also provided excellent results in individual datasets but performed poorly when data is combined. This research highlights the adaptability of Transformer-based models to various image modalities and features. However, challenges persist, including limited annotated data and interpretability issues.

However, existing works on BaB for NN verification have mostly focused on NNs with piecewise linear activations, especially ReLU networks. In this paper, we develop a general framework, named GenBaB, to conduct BaB on general nonlinearities to verify NNs with general architectures, based on linear bound propagation for NN verification. To decide which neuron to branch, we design a new branching heuristic which leverages linear bounds as shortcuts to efficiently estimate the potential improvement after branching. To decide nontrivial branching points for general nonlinear functions, we propose to pre-optimize branching points, which can be efficiently leveraged during verification with a lookup table. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GenBaB on verifying a wide range of NNs, including NNs with activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, Sine and GeLU, as well as NNs involving multi-dimensional nonlinear operations such as multiplications in LSTMs and Vision Transformers. Our framework also allows the verification of general nonlinear computation graphs and enables verification applications beyond simple NNs, particularly for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF).

Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures, in particular, have demonstrated strong feature extraction capabilities when pre-trained on large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce the Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer (MR-IPT), a ViT-based framework designed to enhance the generalizability and robustness of accelerated MRI reconstruction. Unlike conventional deep learning models that require separate training for different acceleration factors, MR-IPT is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset encompassing multiple undersampling patterns and acceleration settings, enabling a unified reconstruction framework. By leveraging a shared transformer backbone, MR-IPT effectively learns universal feature representations, allowing it to generalize across diverse reconstruction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR-IPT outperforms both CNN-based and existing transformer-based methods, achieving superior reconstruction quality across varying acceleration factors and sampling masks. Moreover, MR-IPT exhibits strong robustness, maintaining high performance even under unseen acquisition setups, highlighting its potential as a scalable and efficient solution for accelerated MRI.

Many existing defenses against these attacks, such as adversarial training, rely on full-model fine-tuning to induce robustness in the models. These defenses require storing a copy of the entire model, that can have billions of parameters, for each task. At the same time, parameter-efficient prompt tuning is used to adapt large transformer-based models to downstream tasks without the need to save large copies. In this paper, we examine parameter-efficient prompt tuning of Vision Transformers for downstream tasks under the lens of robustness. We show that previous adversarial defense methods, when applied to the prompt tuning paradigm, suffer from gradient obfuscation and are vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We introduce ADAPT, a novel framework for performing adaptive adversarial training in the prompt tuning paradigm. Our method achieves competitive robust accuracy of ~40% w.r.t.

However, extending VLMs to 3D medical imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to self-attention's quadratic complexity, or 3D convolutions, which demand excessive parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D medical image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along depth, height, and width. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports, for zero-shot multi-abnormality detection across 18 pathologies. Compared to ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet, DCFormer achieves superior efficiency and accuracy, with DCFormer-Tiny reaching 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score while using significantly fewer parameters. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

This study focuses on fine-tuning the Vision Transformer (ViT) model specifically for HAR using radar-based Time-Doppler signatures. Unlike traditional image datasets, these signals present unique challenges due to their non-visual nature and the high degree of similarity among various activities. Directly fine-tuning the ViT with all parameters proves suboptimal for this application. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning in the weight space to facilitate knowledge transfer from pre-trained ViT models. Additionally, to extract fine-grained features, we enhance feature representation through the integration of a serial-parallel adapter in the feature space. Our innovative joint fine-tuning method, tailored for radar-based Time-Doppler signatures, significantly improves HAR accuracy, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methodologies in this domain.

| **[Mechanistic Understandings of Representation Vulnerabilities and Engineering Robust Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04679v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While transformer-based models dominate NLP and vision applications, their underlying mechanisms to map the input space to the label space semantically are not well understood. In this paper, we study the sources of known representation vulnerabilities of vision transformers (ViT), where perceptually identical images can have very different representations and semantically unrelated images can have the same representation. Our analysis indicates that imperceptible changes to the input can result in significant representation changes, particularly in later layers, suggesting potential instabilities in the performance of ViTs. Our comprehensive study reveals that adversarial effects, while subtle in early layers, propagate and amplify through the network, becoming most pronounced in middle to late layers. This insight motivates the development of NeuroShield-ViT, a novel defense mechanism that strategically neutralizes vulnerable neurons in earlier layers to prevent the cascade of adversarial effects. We demonstrate NeuroShield-ViT's effectiveness across various attacks, particularly excelling against strong iterative attacks, and showcase its remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. Without fine-tuning, our method achieves a competitive accuracy of 77.8% on adversarial examples, surpassing conventional robustness methods. Our results shed new light on how adversarial effects propagate through ViT layers, while providing a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks. Additionally, they provide a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification and object detection problems, demonstrating the potential of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone.

| **[AIQViT: Architecture-Informed Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04628v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising solution for reducing the storage and computational cost of vision transformers (ViTs). Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In response, this study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Autonomous Driving (AD) assistance system that integrates a vision adapter and an LLM reasoning module to enhance visual understanding and decision-making. The vision adapter, combining YOLOv4 and Vision Transformer (ViT), extracts comprehensive visual features, while GPT-4 enables human-like spatial reasoning and response generation.

However, this task remains challenging due to the overlapping imaging characteristics of PsP and TP. This study therefore proposes a multimodal deep-learning approach utilizing complementary information from routine anatomical MR images, clinical parameters, and RT treatment planning information for improved predictive accuracy. The approach utilizes a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) to encode multi-sequence MR brain volumes to effectively capture both global and local context from the high dimensional input. The encoder is trained in a self-supervised upstream task on unlabeled glioma MRI datasets from the open BraTS2021, UPenn-GBM, and UCSF-PDGM datasets to generate compact, clinically relevant representations from FLAIR and T1 post-contrast sequences. These encoded MR inputs are then integrated with clinical data and RT treatment planning information through guided cross-modal attention, improving progression classification accuracy. This work was developed using two datasets from different centers: the Burdenko Glioblastoma Progression Dataset (n = 59) for training and validation, and the GlioCMV progression dataset from the University Hospital Erlangen (UKER) (n = 20) for testing. The proposed method achieved an AUC of 75.3%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art data-driven approaches. Importantly, the proposed approach relies on readily available anatomical MRI sequences, clinical data, and RT treatment planning information, enhancing its clinical feasibility. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of limited data availability for PsP and TP differentiation and could allow for improved clinical decision-making and optimized treatment plans for GBM patients.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Retrospective Systematic Study on Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer-assisted Ultrasound Screening for Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03772v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with early detection being crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, early screening for HCC using ultrasound suffers from insufficient sensitivity and is highly dependent on the expertise of radiologists for interpretation. Leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, this study proposes an innovative Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer (HSQformer) model that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance the accuracy of HCC diagnosis in ultrasound screening. The HSQformer leverages sparse latent space representations to capture hierarchical details at various granularities without the need for complex adjustments, and adopts a modular, plug-and-play design philosophy, ensuring the model's versatility and ease of use. The HSQformer's performance was rigorously tested across three distinct clinical scenarios: single-center, multi-center, and high-risk patient testing. In each of these settings, it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art models, such as ConvNext and SwinTransformer. Notably, the HSQformer even matched the diagnostic capabilities of senior radiologists and comprehensively surpassed those of junior radiologists. The experimental results from this study strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical potential of AI-assisted tools in HCC screening.

| **[Brain Tumor Identification using Improved YOLOv8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03746v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the extent of brain tumors is a significant challenge in brain cancer treatment. The main difficulty is in the approximate detection of tumor size. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a critical diagnostic tool. However, manually detecting the boundaries of brain tumors from MRI scans is a labor-intensive task that requires extensive expertise. Deep learning and computer-aided detection techniques have led to notable advances in machine learning for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a modified You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model to accurately detect the tumors within the MRI images. The proposed model replaced the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm with a Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT- DETR) in the detection head. NMS filters out redundant or overlapping bounding boxes in the detected tumors, but they are hand-designed and pre-set. RT-DETR removes hand-designed components. The second improvement was made by replacing the normal convolution block with ghost convolution. Ghost Convolution reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining high accuracy and enabling faster inference, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. The third improvement was made by introducing a vision transformer block in the backbone of YOLOv8 to extract context-aware features. We used a publicly available dataset of brain tumors in the proposed model. The proposed model performed better than the original YOLOv8 model and also performed better than other object detectors (Faster R- CNN, Mask R-CNN, YOLO, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, SSD, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, and DETR). The proposed model achieved 0.91 mAP (mean Average Precision)@0.5.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Laws in Patchification: An Image Is Worth 50,176 Tokens And More](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03738v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT), patchification has long been regarded as a de facto image tokenization approach for plain visual architectures. By compressing the spatial size of images, this approach can effectively shorten the token sequence and reduce the computational cost of ViT-like plain architectures. In this work, we aim to thoroughly examine the information loss caused by this patchification-based compressive encoding paradigm and how it affects visual understanding. We conduct extensive patch size scaling experiments and excitedly observe an intriguing scaling law in patchification: the models can consistently benefit from decreased patch sizes and attain improved predictive performance, until it reaches the minimum patch size of 1x1, i.e., pixel tokenization. This conclusion is broadly applicable across different vision tasks, various input scales, and diverse architectures such as ViT and the recent Mamba models. Moreover, as a by-product, we discover that with smaller patches, task-specific decoder heads become less critical for dense prediction. In the experiments, we successfully scale up the visual sequence to an exceptional length of 50,176 tokens, achieving a competitive test accuracy of 84.6% with a base-sized model on the ImageNet-1k benchmark. We hope this study can provide insights and theoretical foundations for future works of building non-compressive vision models.

Although they show successful generalization to various PDEs, existing methods treat each data point as a single token, and suffer from computational inefficiency when processing dense data, limiting their application in higher spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose \textit{Vision In-Context Operator Networks} (VICON), incorporating a vision transformer architecture that efficiently processes 2D functions through patch-wise operations. We evaluated our method on three fluid dynamics datasets, demonstrating both superior performance (reducing the rescaled $L^2$ error by $40\%$ and $61.6\%$ for two benchmark datasets for compressible flows, respectively) and computational efficiency (requiring only one-third of the inference time per frame) in long-term rollout predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model with fixed timestep prediction: Multiple Physics Pretraining (MPP). Compared to MPP, our method preserves the benefits of in-context operator learning, enabling flexible context formation when dealing with insufficient frame counts or varying timestep values.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update 2 more experiments compared to original submission; minor writing adjustments</p></details> | None |

The predominant models use the so-called transformer network and have a large field of applicability, including predicting text and images, classification, and even predicting solutions to the dynamics of physical systems. Here we present a variational quantum circuit architecture named Self-Attention Sequential Quantum Transformer Channel (SASQuaTCh), which builds networks of qubits that perform analogous operations of the transformer network, namely the keystone self-attention operation, and leads to an exponential improvement in parameter complexity and run-time complexity over its classical counterpart. Our approach leverages recent insights from kernel-based operator learning in the context of predicting spatiotemporal systems to represent deep layers of a vision transformer network using simple gate operations and a set of multi-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms. To validate our approach, we consider image classification tasks in simulation and with hardware, where with only 9 qubits and a handful of parameters we are able to simultaneously embed and classify a grayscale image of handwritten digits with high accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[ZISVFM: Zero-Shot Object Instance Segmentation in Indoor Robotic Environments with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03266v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service robots operating in unstructured environments must effectively recognize and segment unknown objects to enhance their functionality. Traditional supervised learningbased segmentation techniques require extensive annotated datasets, which are impractical for the diversity of objects encountered in real-world scenarios. Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS) methods aim to address this by training models on synthetic data to generalize to novel objects, but they often suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap. This paper proposes a novel approach (ZISVFM) for solving UOIS by leveraging the powerful zero-shot capability of the segment anything model (SAM) and explicit visual representations from a selfsupervised vision transformer (ViT). The proposed framework operates in three stages: (1) generating object-agnostic mask proposals from colorized depth images using SAM, (2) refining these proposals using attention-based features from the selfsupervised ViT to filter non-object masks, and (3) applying K-Medoids clustering to generate point prompts that guide SAM towards precise object segmentation. Experimental validation on two benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrates the superior performance of ZISVFM in complex environments, including hierarchical settings such as cabinets, drawers, and handheld objects.

| **[A Theoretical Analysis of Self-Supervised Learning for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02233v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has become a cornerstone in computer vision, primarily divided into reconstruction-based methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) and discriminative methods such as contrastive learning (CL). Recent empirical observations reveal that MAE and CL capture different types of representations: CL tends to focus on global patterns, while MAE adeptly captures both global and subtle local information simultaneously. Despite a flurry of recent empirical investigations to shed light on this difference, theoretical understanding remains limited, especially on the dominant architecture vision transformers (ViTs). In this paper, to provide rigorous insights, we model the visual data distribution by considering two types of spatial features: dominant global features and comparatively minuscule local features, and study the impact of imbalance among these features. We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer softmax-based ViTs on both MAE and CL objectives using gradient descent. Our analysis shows that as the degree of feature imbalance varies, ViTs trained with the MAE objective effectively learn both global and local features to achieve near-optimal reconstruction, while the CL-trained ViTs favor predominantly global features, even under mild imbalance. These results provide a theoretical explanation for distinct behaviors of MAE and CL observed in empirical studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

With the advent of advanced computing technology, CNN models have achieved to remarkable success, particularly in computer vision applications. Nevertheless, the efficacy of the conventional CNN is often hindered due to class imbalance and inter-class similarity problems, which are particularly prominent in the computer vision field. In this research, we introduce for the first time an ``Edge Attention Module (EAM)'' consisting of a Max-Min pooling layer, followed by convolutional layers. This Max-Min pooling is entirely a novel pooling technique, specifically designed to capture only the edge information that is crucial for any object classification task. Therefore, by integrating this novel pooling technique into the attention module, the CNN network inherently prioritizes on essential edge features, thereby boosting the accuracy and F1-score of the model significantly. We have implemented our proposed EAM or 2EAMs on several standard pre-trained CNN models for Caltech-101, Caltech-256, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet-200 datasets. The extensive experiments reveal that our proposed framework (that is, EAM with CNN and 2EAMs with CNN), outperforms all pre-trained CNN models as well as recent trend models ``Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT)'', ``Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)'', and ConvNext, by substantial margins. We have achieved the accuracy of 95.5% and 86% by the proposed framework on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets, respectively. So far, this is the best results on these datasets, to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

However, traditional manual labeling involves high cost to annotate the vast amount of required data for training robust model. To mitigate this cost of manual labeling, we propose a Label Anything Model (denoted as LAM), serving as an interpretable, high-fidelity, and prompt-free data annotator. Specifically, we firstly incorporate a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract the latent features. On top of ViT, we propose a semantic class adapter (SCA) and an optimization-oriented unrolling algorithm (OptOU), both with a quite small number of trainable parameters. SCA is proposed to fuse ViT-extracted features to consolidate the basis of the subsequent automatic annotation. OptOU consists of multiple cascading layers and each layer contains an optimization formulation to align its output with the ground truth as closely as possible, though which OptOU acts as being interpretable rather than learning-based blackbox nature. In addition, training SCA and OptOU requires only a single pre-annotated RGB seed image, owing to their small volume of learnable parameters. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed LAM can generate high-fidelity annotations (almost 100% in mIoU) for multiple real-world datasets (i.e., Camvid, Cityscapes, and Apolloscapes) and CARLA simulation dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Maximizing the Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Global Average Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02919v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision transformers, position embedding (PE) plays a crucial role in capturing the order of tokens. However, in vision transformer structures, there is a limitation in the expressiveness of PE due to the structure where position embedding is simply added to the token embedding. A layer-wise method that delivers PE to each layer and applies independent Layer Normalizations for token embedding and PE has been adopted to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we identify the conflicting result that occurs in a layer-wise structure when using the global average pooling (GAP) method instead of the class token. To overcome this problem, we propose MPVG, which maximizes the effectiveness of PE in a layer-wise structure with GAP. Specifically, we identify that PE counterbalances token embedding values at each layer in a layer-wise structure. Furthermore, we recognize that the counterbalancing role of PE is insufficient in the layer-wise structure, and we address this by maximizing the effectiveness of PE through MPVG. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PE performs a counterbalancing role and that maintaining this counterbalancing directionality significantly impacts vision transformers. As a result, the experimental results show that MPVG outperforms existing methods across vision transformers on various tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

We present an off-grid Fovea-Like Input Patching (FLIP) approach, which selects image input and encodes it from the beginning in an object-focused manner. While doing so, it separates locational encoding from an object-centric perceptual code. FLIP is more data-efficient and yields improved segmentation performance when masking relatively small objects in high-resolution visual scenes. On standard benchmarks such as Hypersim, KITTI-360, and OpenImages, FLIP achieves Intersection over Union (IoU) scores that approach the performance of SAM with much less compute effort. It surpasses FastSAM in all IoU measurements. We also introduce an additional semi-natural but highly intuitive dataset where FLIP outperforms SAM and FastSAM overall and particularly on relatively small objects. Seeing that FLIP is an end-to-end object-centric segmentation approach, it has high potential particularly for applications that benefit from computationally efficient, spatially highly selective object tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a dual contribution: first, a systematic analysis of current methodological practices in skin disease classification research, revealing substantial inconsistencies in data preparation, augmentation strategies, and performance reporting; second, a comprehensive training and evaluation framework demonstrated through experiments with the DINOv2-Large vision transformer across three benchmark datasets (HAM10000, DermNet, ISIC Atlas). The analysis identifies concerning patterns, including pre-split data augmentation and validation-based reporting, potentially leading to overestimated metrics, while highlighting the lack of unified methodology standards. The experimental results demonstrate DINOv2's performance in skin disease classification, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.85 (HAM10000), 0.71 (DermNet), and 0.84 (ISIC Atlas). Attention map analysis reveals critical patterns in the model's decision-making, showing sophisticated feature recognition in typical presentations but significant vulnerabilities with atypical cases and composite images. Our findings highlight the need for standardized evaluation protocols and careful implementation strategies in clinical settings. We propose comprehensive methodological recommendations for model development, evaluation, and clinical deployment, emphasizing rigorous data preparation, systematic error analysis, and specialized protocols for different image types.

However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose UniGaze, which leverages large-scale, in-the-wild facial datasets through self-supervised pre-training for gaze estimation. We carefully curate multiple facial datasets that capture diverse variations in identity, lighting, background, and head poses. By directly applying Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training on normalized face images with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, our UniGaze learns appropriate feature representations within the specific input space required by downstream gaze estimation models. Through comprehensive experiments using challenging cross-dataset evaluation and novel protocols, including leave-one-dataset-out and joint-dataset settings, we demonstrate that UniGaze significantly improves generalization across multiple data domains while minimizing reliance on costly labeled data. The source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Faster Vision Mamba is Rebuilt in Minutes via Merged Token Re-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12496v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Mamba (e.g., Vim) has successfully been integrated into computer vision, and token reduction has yielded promising outcomes in Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, token reduction performs less effectively on Vision Mamba compared to ViTs. Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and bad performance. This makes it not a good solution for enhancing efficiency in Mamba. Token merging, which preserves more token information than pruning, has demonstrated commendable performance in ViTs. Nevertheless, vanilla merging performance decreases as the reduction ratio increases either, failing to maintain the key knowledge in Mamba. Re-training the token-reduced model enhances the performance of Mamba, by effectively rebuilding the key knowledge. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drop 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Accurate Post-Training Quantization of Vision Transformers via Error Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06794v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) for vision transformers (ViTs) has received increasing attention from both academic and industrial communities due to its minimal data needs and high time efficiency. However, many current methods fail to account for the complex interactions between quantized weights and activations, resulting in significant quantization errors and suboptimal performance. This paper presents ERQ, an innovative two-step PTQ method specifically crafted to reduce quantization errors arising from activation and weight quantization sequentially. The first step, Activation quantization error reduction (Aqer), first applies Reparameterization Initialization aimed at mitigating initial quantization errors in high-variance activations. Then, it further mitigates the errors by formulating a Ridge Regression problem, which updates the weights maintained at full-precision using a closed-form solution. The second step, Weight quantization error reduction (Wqer), first applies Dual Uniform Quantization to handle weights with numerous outliers, which arise from adjustments made during Reparameterization Initialization, thereby reducing initial weight quantization errors. Then, it employs an iterative approach to further tackle the errors. In each iteration, it adopts Rounding Refinement that uses an empirically derived, efficient proxy to refine the rounding directions of quantized weights, complemented by a Ridge Regression solver to reduce the errors. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate ERQ's superior performance across various ViTs variants and tasks. For example, ERQ surpasses the state-of-the-art GPTQ by a notable 36.81% in accuracy for W3A4 ViT-S.

| **[Memory Efficient Transformer Adapter for Dense Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01962v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While current Vision Transformer (ViT) adapter methods have shown promising accuracy, their inference speed is implicitly hindered by inefficient memory access operations, e.g., standard normalization and frequent reshaping. In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate that META exhibits superior generalization capability and stronger adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Texture Image Synthesis Using Spatial GAN Based on Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01842v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering (AI-SOFT), Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[ASCENT-ViT: Attention-based Scale-aware Concept Learning Framework for Enhanced Alignment in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09221v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Vision Transformers (ViTs) are increasingly adopted in sensitive vision applications, there is a growing demand for improved interpretability. This has led to efforts to forward-align these models with carefully annotated abstract, human-understandable semantic entities - concepts. Concepts provide global rationales to the model predictions and can be quickly understood/intervened on by domain experts. Most current research focuses on designing model-agnostic, plug-and-play generic concept-based explainability modules that do not incorporate the inner workings of foundation models (e.g., inductive biases, scale invariance, etc.) during training. To alleviate this issue for ViTs, in this paper, we propose ASCENT-ViT, an attention-based, concept learning framework that effectively composes scale and position-aware representations from multiscale feature pyramids and ViT patch representations, respectively. Further, these representations are aligned with concept annotations through attention matrices - which incorporate spatial and global (semantic) concepts. ASCENT-ViT can be utilized as a classification head on top of standard ViT backbones for improved predictive performance and accurate and robust concept explanations as demonstrated on five datasets, including three widely used benchmarks (CUB, Pascal APY, Concept-MNIST) and 2 real-world datasets (AWA2, KITS).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[How Do the Architecture and Optimizer Affect Representation Learning? On the Training Dynamics of Representations in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17377v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we elucidate how representations in deep neural networks (DNNs) evolve during training. Our focus is on overparameterized learning settings where the training continues much after the trained DNN starts to perfectly fit its training data. We examine the evolution of learned representations along the entire training process. We explore the representational similarity of DNN layers, each layer with respect to its own representations throughout the training process. For this, we use two similarity metrics: (1) The centered kernel alignment (CKA) similarity; (2) Similarity of decision regions of linear classifier probes that we train for the DNN layers. We visualize and analyze the decision regions of the DNN output and the layer probes during the DNN training to show how they geometrically evolve. Our extensive experiments discover training dynamics patterns that can emerge in layers depending on the relative layer-depth, architecture and optimizer. Among our findings: (i) The training phases, including those related to memorization, are more distinguishable in SGD training than in Adam training, and for Vision Transformer (ViT) than for ResNet; (ii) Unlike ResNet, the ViT layers have synchronized dynamics of representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Knowledge from geoinformatics derived through Spatial Masks (SM) in GIS is infused into an architecture of CNN and ViT, in this proposed KGML approach. It is found to provide much better performance compared to the baseline of CNN and ViT only in the classification of multiple types of power plants from real satellite imagery, hence emphasizing the vital role of the geoinformatics-guided approach. This work makes a contribution to the main theme of KGML that can be beneficial in many AI systems today. It makes broader impacts on AI in Smart Cities, and Environmental Computing.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[How to set AdamW's weight decay as you scale model and dataset size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13698v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling of the optimal AdamW weight decay hyperparameter with model and dataset size is critical as we seek to build larger models, but is poorly understood. We show that weights learned by AdamW can be understood as an exponential moving average (EMA) of recent updates. This gives critical insights for how to set the weight decay in AdamW, and how the weight decay should scale with model and dataset size. In particular, the key hyperparameter for an exponential moving average is the EMA timescale. Intuitively, the EMA timescale can be understood as the number of recent iterations the EMA averages over. We find that the optimal timescale, measured in epochs, is roughly constant as we change model and dataset size. Moreover, given a learning rate, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EMA timescale to the weight decay hyperparameter. Thus, if the optimal EMA timescale is constant, that implies that as the dataset size increases, the optimal weight decay should fall and as the model size increases, the optimal weight decay should increase (if we follow the muP recommendation for scaling the learning rate). We validate these scaling rules on ResNet-18 and Vision Transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and on NanoGPT pre-training on OpenWebText. Finally, we found that as training progresses, muP's learning rate scaling breaks down for AdamW unless weight decay is scaled appropriately.</p></details> |  | None |
