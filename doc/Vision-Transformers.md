| **[BHViT: Binarized Hybrid Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02394v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model binarization has made significant progress in enabling real-time and energy-efficient computation for convolutional neural networks (CNN), offering a potential solution to the deployment challenges faced by Vision Transformers (ViTs) on edge devices. However, due to the structural differences between CNN and Transformer architectures, simply applying binary CNN strategies to the ViT models will lead to a significant performance drop. To tackle this challenge, we propose BHViT, a binarization-friendly hybrid ViT architecture and its full binarization model with the guidance of three important observations. Initially, BHViT utilizes the local information interaction and hierarchical feature aggregation technique from coarse to fine levels to address redundant computations stemming from excessive tokens. Then, a novel module based on shift operations is proposed to enhance the performance of the binary Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) module without significantly increasing computational overhead. In addition, an innovative attention matrix binarization method based on quantization decomposition is proposed to evaluate the token's importance in the binarized attention matrix. Finally, we propose a regularization loss to address the inadequate optimization caused by the incompatibility between the weight oscillation in the binary layers and the Adam Optimizer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves SOTA performance among binary ViT methods.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | None |

While classical methods rely on hand-crafted features and thus are universally applicable without task-specific training, they often struggle with occlusions and environmental variations, whereas learning-based approaches improve robustness but typically require extensive training. We present a visual servoing approach that leverages pretrained vision transformers for semantic feature extraction, combining the advantages of both paradigms while also being able to generalize beyond the provided sample. Our approach achieves full convergence in unperturbed scenarios and surpasses classical image-based visual servoing by up to 31.2\% relative improvement in perturbed scenarios. Even the convergence rates of learning-based methods are matched despite requiring no task- or object-specific training. Real-world evaluations confirm robust performance in end-effector positioning, industrial box manipulation, and grasping of unseen objects using only a reference from the same category.

| **[MobileViM: A Light-weight and Dimension-independent Vision Mamba for 3D Medical Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13524v4)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in healthcare. Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The corresponding author disagrees with the manuscript submitted to arXiv</p></details> | None |
| **[Pathfinder for Low-altitude Aircraft with Binary Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08824v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prior global topological map (e.g., the OpenStreetMap, OSM) can boost the performance of autonomous mapping by a ground mobile robot. However, the prior map is usually incomplete due to lacking labeling in partial paths. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an OSM maker using airborne sensors carried by low-altitude aircraft, where the core of the OSM maker is a novel efficient pathfinder approach based on LiDAR and camera data, i.e., a binary dual-stream road segmentation model. Specifically, a multi-scale feature extraction based on the UNet architecture is implemented for images and point clouds. To reduce the effect caused by the sparsity of point cloud, an attention-guided gated block is designed to integrate image and point-cloud features. To optimize the model for edge deployment that significantly reduces storage footprint and computational demands, we propose a binarization streamline to each model component, including a variant of vision transformer (ViT) architecture as the encoder of the image branch, and new focal and perception losses to optimize the model training. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our pathfinder method achieves SOTA accuracy with high efficiency in finding paths from the low-level airborne sensors, and we can create complete OSM prior maps based on the segmented road skeletons.

| **[GBT-SAM: A Parameter-Efficient Depth-Aware Model for Generalizable Brain tumour Segmentation on mp-MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04325v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gliomas are brain tumours that stand out for their highly lethal and aggressive nature, which demands a precise approach in their diagnosis. Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in the evaluation and follow-up of these tumours, allowing specialists to analyse their morphology. However, existing methods for automatic glioma segmentation often lack generalization capability across other brain tumour domains, require extensive computational resources, or fail to fully utilize the multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) data used to delineate them. In this work, we introduce GBT-SAM, a novel Generalizable Brain Tumour (GBT) framework that extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to brain tumour segmentation tasks. Our method employs a two-step training protocol: first, fine-tuning the patch embedding layer to process the entire mp-MRI modalities, and second, incorporating parameter-efficient LoRA blocks and a Depth-Condition block into the Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture inter-slice correlations. GBT-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Adult Glioma dataset (Dice Score of $93.54$) while demonstrating robust generalization across Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets. Furthermore, GBT-SAM uses less than 6.5M trainable parameters, thus offering an efficient solution for brain tumour segmentation. \\ Our code and models are available at https://github.com/vpulab/med-sam-brain .</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/vpulab/med-sam-brain) |
| **[Simple Self Organizing Map with Visual Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04121v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various vision tasks. However, they tend to underperform on smaller datasets due to their inherent lack of inductive biases. Current approaches address this limitation implicitly-often by pairing ViTs with pretext tasks or by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to strengthen the prior. In contrast, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), a widely adopted self-supervised framework, are inherently structured to preserve topology and spatial organization, making them a promising candidate to directly address the limitations of ViTs in limited or small training datasets. Despite this potential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other, aiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that these architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to significantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks. Code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures. Submitted to IEEE.

| **[Comparing Deep Neural Network for Multi-Label ECG Diagnosis From Scanned ECG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14909v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated ECG diagnosis has seen significant advancements with deep learning techniques, but real-world applications still face challenges when dealing with scanned paper ECGs. In this study, we explore multi-label classification of ECGs extracted from scanned images, moving beyond traditional binary classification (normal/abnormal). We evaluate the performance of multiple deep neural network architectures, including AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, and Vision Transformer, on scanned ECG datasets. Our comparative analysis examines model accuracy, robustness to image artifacts, and generalizability across different ECG conditions. Additionally, we investigate whether ECG signals extracted from scanned images retain sufficient diagnostic information for reliable automated classification. The findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each architecture, providing insights into the feasibility of image-based ECG diagnosis and its potential integration into clinical workflows.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DTU-Net: A Multi-Scale Dilated Transformer Network for Nonlinear Hyperspectral Unmixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03465v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have shown significant success in hyperspectral unmixing (HU). However, challenges remain. While multi-scale and long-range spatial correlations are essential in unmixing tasks, current Transformer-based unmixing networks, built on Vision Transformer (ViT) or Swin-Transformer, struggle to capture them effectively. Additionally, current Transformer-based unmixing networks rely on the linear mixing model, which lacks the flexibility to accommodate scenarios where nonlinear effects are significant. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-scale Dilated Transformer-based unmixing network for nonlinear HU (DTU-Net). The encoder employs two branches. The first one performs multi-scale spatial feature extraction using Multi-Scale Dilated Attention (MSDA) in the Dilated Transformer, which varies dilation rates across attention heads to capture long-range and multi-scale spatial correlations. The second one performs spectral feature extraction utilizing 3D-CNNs with channel attention. The outputs from both branches are then fused to integrate multi-scale spatial and spectral information, which is subsequently transformed to estimate the abundances. The decoder is designed to accommodate both linear and nonlinear mixing scenarios. Its interpretability is enhanced by explicitly modeling the relationships between endmembers, abundances, and nonlinear coefficients in accordance with the polynomial post-nonlinear mixing model (PPNMM). Experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed DTU-Net compared to PPNMM-derived methods and several advanced unmixing networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[COARSE: Collaborative Pseudo-Labeling with Coarse Real Labels for Off-Road Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03947v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous off-road navigation faces challenges due to diverse, unstructured environments, requiring robust perception with both geometric and semantic understanding. However, scarce densely labeled semantic data limits generalization across domains. Simulated data helps, but introduces domain adaptation issues. We propose COARSE, a semi-supervised domain adaptation framework for off-road semantic segmentation, leveraging sparse, coarse in-domain labels and densely labeled out-of-domain data. Using pretrained vision transformers, we bridge domain gaps with complementary pixel-level and patch-level decoders, enhanced by a collaborative pseudo-labeling strategy on unlabeled data. Evaluations on RUGD and Rellis-3D datasets show significant improvements of 9.7\% and 8.4\% respectively, versus only using coarse data. Tests on real-world off-road vehicle data in a multi-biome setting further demonstrate COARSE's applicability.</p></details> | preprint, 8 pages | None |
| **[Pruning Deep Neural Networks via a Combination of the Marchenko-Pastur Distribution and Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01922v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have brought significant advancements in various applications in recent years, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. In particular, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful class of models in the field of deep learning for image classification. In this work, we propose a novel Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based method for pruning pre-trained DNNs, based on the sparsification of weights and singular vectors, and apply it to ViTs. RMT provides a robust framework to analyze the statistical properties of large matrices, which has been shown to be crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of DNNs. We demonstrate that our RMT-based pruning can be used to reduce the number of parameters of ViT models (trained on ImageNet) by 30-50\% with less than 1\% loss in accuracy. To our knowledge, this represents the state-of-the-art in pruning for these ViT models. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous mathematical underpinning of the above numerical studies, namely we proved a theorem for fully connected DNNs, and other more general DNN structures, describing how the randomness in the weight matrices of a DNN decreases as the weights approach a local or global minimum (during training). We verify this theorem through numerical experiments on fully connected DNNs, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. Moreover, we prove a theorem that describes how DNN loss decreases as we remove randomness in the weight layers, and show a monotone dependence of the decrease in loss with the amount of randomness that we remove. Our results also provide significant RMT-based insights into the role of regularization during training and pruning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Label-Efficient LiDAR Semantic Segmentation with 2D-3D Vision Transformer Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03299v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR semantic segmentation models are typically trained from random initialization as universal pre-training is hindered by the lack of large, diverse datasets. Moreover, most point cloud segmentation architectures incorporate custom network layers, limiting the transferability of advances from vision-based architectures. Inspired by recent advances in universal foundation models, we propose BALViT, a novel approach that leverages frozen vision models as amodal feature encoders for learning strong LiDAR encoders. Specifically, BALViT incorporates both range-view and bird's-eye-view LiDAR encoding mechanisms, which we combine through a novel 2D-3D adapter. While the range-view features are processed through a frozen image backbone, our bird's-eye-view branch enhances them through multiple cross-attention interactions. Thereby, we continuously improve the vision network with domain-dependent knowledge, resulting in a strong label-efficient LiDAR encoding mechanism. Extensive evaluations of BALViT on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on small data regimes. We make the code and models publicly available at: http://balvit.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transformer Block Coupling and its Correlation with Generalization in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07810v5)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing, and a precise understanding of the internal mechanisms driving their success is essential. In this work, we analyze the trajectories of token embeddings as they pass through transformer blocks, linearizing the system along these trajectories through their Jacobian matrices. By examining the relationships between these block Jacobians, we uncover the phenomenon of \textbf{transformer block coupling} in a multitude of LLMs, characterized by the coupling of their top singular vectors across tokens and depth. Our findings reveal that coupling \textit{positively correlates} with model performance, and that this relationship is stronger than with other hyperparameters such as parameter count, model depth, and embedding dimension. We further investigate how these properties emerge during training, observing a progressive development of coupling, increased linearity, and layer-wise exponential growth in token trajectories. Additionally, experiments with Vision Transformers (ViTs) corroborate the emergence of coupling and its relationship with generalization, reinforcing our findings in LLMs. Collectively, these insights offer a novel perspective on token interactions in transformers, opening new directions for studying their mechanisms as well as improving training and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Amortized Probabilistic Conditioning for Optimization, Simulation and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15320v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amortized meta-learning methods based on pre-training have propelled fields like natural language processing and vision. Transformer-based neural processes and their variants are leading models for probabilistic meta-learning with a tractable objective. Often trained on synthetic data, these models implicitly capture essential latent information in the data-generation process. However, existing methods do not allow users to flexibly inject (condition on) and extract (predict) this probabilistic latent information at runtime, which is key to many tasks. We introduce the Amortized Conditioning Engine (ACE), a new transformer-based meta-learning model that explicitly represents latent variables of interest. ACE affords conditioning on both observed data and interpretable latent variables, the inclusion of priors at runtime, and outputs predictive distributions for discrete and continuous data and latents. We show ACE's modeling flexibility and performance in diverse tasks such as image completion and classification, Bayesian optimization, and simulation-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 24 figures.

| **[Privacy and Accuracy-Aware AI/ML Model Deduplication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02862v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms, such as Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), training or fine-tuning models on private datasets has become increasingly prevalent. This shift has led to the need for models offering varying privacy guarantees and utility levels to satisfy diverse user requirements. However, managing numerous versions of large models introduces significant operational challenges, including increased inference latency, higher resource consumption, and elevated costs. Model deduplication is a technique widely used by many model serving and database systems to support high-performance and low-cost inference queries and model diagnosis queries. However, none of the existing model deduplication works has considered privacy, leading to unbounded aggregation of privacy costs for certain deduplicated models and inefficiencies when applied to deduplicate DP-trained models. We formalize the problems of deduplicating DP-trained models for the first time and propose a novel privacy- and accuracy-aware deduplication mechanism to address the problems. We developed a greedy strategy to select and assign base models to target models to minimize storage and privacy costs. When deduplicating a target model, we dynamically schedule accuracy validations and apply the Sparse Vector Technique to reduce the privacy costs associated with private validation data. Compared to baselines that do not provide privacy guarantees, our approach improved the compression ratio by up to $35\times$ for individual models (including large language models and vision transformers). We also observed up to $43\times$ inference speedup due to the reduction of I/O operations.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> | None |
| **[Developing a PET/CT Foundation Model for Cross-Modal Anatomical and Functional Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02824v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In oncology, Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET/CT) is widely used in cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring, as it combines anatomical details from CT with functional metabolic activity and molecular marker expression information from PET. However, existing artificial intelligence-driven PET/CT analyses rely predominantly on task-specific models trained from scratch or on limited datasets, limiting their generalizability and robustness. To address this, we propose a foundation model approach specifically designed for multimodal PET/CT imaging. We introduce the Cross-Fraternal Twin Masked Autoencoder (FratMAE), a novel framework that effectively integrates whole-body anatomical and functional or molecular information. FratMAE employs separate Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders for PET and CT scans, along with cross-attention decoders that enable synergistic interactions between modalities during masked autoencoder training. Additionally, it incorporates textual metadata to enhance PET representation learning. By pre-training on PET/CT datasets, FratMAE captures intricate cross-modal relationships and global uptake patterns, achieving superior performance on downstream tasks and demonstrating its potential as a generalizable foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[TeTRA-VPR: A Ternary Transformer Approach for Compact Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02511v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Place Recognition (VPR) localizes a query image by matching it against a database of geo-tagged reference images, making it essential for navigation and mapping in robotics. Although Vision Transformer (ViT) solutions deliver high accuracy, their large models often exceed the memory and compute budgets of resource-constrained platforms such as drones and mobile robots. To address this issue, we propose TeTRA, a ternary transformer approach that progressively quantizes the ViT backbone to 2-bit precision and binarizes its final embedding layer, offering substantial reductions in model size and latency. A carefully designed progressive distillation strategy preserves the representational power of a full-precision teacher, allowing TeTRA to retain or even surpass the accuracy of uncompressed convolutional counterparts, despite using fewer resources. Experiments on standard VPR benchmarks demonstrate that TeTRA reduces memory consumption by up to 69% compared to efficient baselines, while lowering inference latency by 35%, with either no loss or a slight improvement in recall@1. These gains enable high-accuracy VPR on power-constrained, memory-limited robotic platforms, making TeTRA an appealing solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Current deepfake detection models often struggle to generalize across a diverse range of deepfake generation techniques and video content. In this work, we propose a Generative Convolutional Vision Transformer (GenConViT) for deepfake video detection. Our model combines ConvNeXt and Swin Transformer models for feature extraction, and it utilizes Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder to learn from the latent data distribution. By learning from the visual artifacts and latent data distribution, GenConViT achieves improved performance in detecting a wide range of deepfake videos. The model is trained and evaluated on DFDC, FF++, TM, DeepfakeTIMIT, and Celeb-DF (v$2$) datasets. The proposed GenConViT model demonstrates strong performance in deepfake video detection, achieving high accuracy across the tested datasets. While our model shows promising results in deepfake video detection by leveraging visual and latent features, we demonstrate that further work is needed to improve its generalizability, i.e., when encountering out-of-distribution data. Our model provides an effective solution for identifying a wide range of fake videos while preserving media integrity.

However, existing algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks and directly applying them to Vision Transformers poses certain limitations due to conceptual disparities. To this end, we propose TokenMix, a data augmentation technique specifically designed for semi-supervised semantic segmentation with Vision Transformers. TokenMix aligns well with the global attention mechanism by mixing images at the token level, enhancing learning capability for contexutual information among image patches. We further incorporate image augmentation and feature augmentation to promote the diversity of augmentation. Moreover, to enhance consistency regularization, we propose a dual-branch framework where each branch applies both image augmentation and feature augmentation to the input image. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets, including Pascal VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO. Results suggest that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms with notably observed accuracy improvement, especially under the circumstance of limited fine annotations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SelaFD:Seamless Adaptation of Vision Transformer Fine-tuning for Radar-based Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04740v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) such as fall detection has become increasingly critical due to the aging population, necessitating effective monitoring systems to prevent serious injuries and fatalities associated with falls. This study focuses on fine-tuning the Vision Transformer (ViT) model specifically for HAR using radar-based Time-Doppler signatures. Unlike traditional image datasets, these signals present unique challenges due to their non-visual nature and the high degree of similarity among various activities. Directly fine-tuning the ViT with all parameters proves suboptimal for this application. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning in the weight space to facilitate knowledge transfer from pre-trained ViT models. Additionally, to extract fine-grained features, we enhance feature representation through the integration of a serial-parallel adapter in the feature space. Our innovative joint fine-tuning method, tailored for radar-based Time-Doppler signatures, significantly improves HAR accuracy, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methodologies in this domain.

However, the non-negative constraint on feature maps and the relaxed exponential function used in approximation lead to significant information loss compared to the original query-key dot products, resulting in less discriminative attention maps with higher entropy. To address the missing interactions driven by negative values in query-key pairs, we propose a polarity-aware linear attention mechanism that explicitly models both same-signed and opposite-signed query-key interactions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relational information. Furthermore, to restore the spiky properties of attention maps, we provide a theoretical analysis proving the existence of a class of element-wise functions (with positive first and second derivatives) that can reduce entropy in the attention distribution. For simplicity, and recognizing the distinct contributions of each dimension, we employ a learnable power function for rescaling, allowing strong and weak attention signals to be effectively separated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PolaFormer improves performance on various vision tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.6%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Locality Alignment Improves Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11087v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption in recent years, but many still struggle with basic spatial reasoning errors. We hypothesize that this is due to VLMs adopting pre-trained vision backbones, specifically vision transformers (ViTs) trained with image-level supervision and minimal inductive biases. Such models may fail to encode the class contents at each position in the image, and our goal is to resolve this with a vision backbone that effectively captures both local and global image semantics. Our main insight is that we do not require new supervision to learn this capability - pre-trained models contain significant knowledge of local semantics that we can extract and use for scalable self-supervision. We propose a new efficient post-training stage for ViTs called locality alignment and a novel fine-tuning procedure called MaskEmbed that uses a masked reconstruction loss to learn semantic contributions for each image patch. We first evaluate locality alignment with a vision-only benchmark, finding that it improves a model's performance at patch-level semantic segmentation, especially for strong backbones trained with image-caption pairs (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP). We then train a series of VLMs with and without locality alignment, and show that locality-aligned backbones improve performance across a range of benchmarks, particularly ones that involve spatial understanding (e.g., RefCOCO, OCID-Ref, TallyQA, VSR, AI2D). Overall, we demonstrate that we can efficiently learn local semantic extraction via a locality alignment stage, and that this procedure benefits VLM training recipes that use off-the-shelf vision backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-Ready</p></details> | None |
| **[Low-Level Matters: An Efficient Hybrid Architecture for Robust Multi-frame Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02220v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-frame infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in low-altitude and maritime surveillance. The hybrid architecture combining CNNs and Transformers shows great promise for enhancing multi-frame IRSTD performance. In this paper, we propose LVNet, a simple yet powerful hybrid architecture that redefines low-level feature learning in hybrid frameworks for multi-frame IRSTD. Our key insight is that the standard linear patch embeddings in Vision Transformers are insufficient for capturing the scale-sensitive local features critical to infrared small targets. To address this limitation, we introduce a multi-scale CNN frontend that explicitly models local features by leveraging the local spatial bias of convolution. Additionally, we design a U-shaped video Transformer for multi-frame spatiotemporal context modeling, effectively capturing the motion characteristics of targets. Experiments on the publicly available datasets IRDST and NUDT-MIRSDT demonstrate that LVNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, compared to the current best-performing method, LMAFormer, LVNet achieves an improvement of 5.63\% / 18.36\% in nIoU, while using only 1/221 of the parameters and 1/92 / 1/21 of the computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the importance of low-level representation learning in hybrid architectures.

| **[ViTCoD: Vision Transformer Acceleration via Dedicated Algorithm and Accelerator Co-Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09573v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks. However, ViTs' self-attention module is still arguably a major bottleneck, limiting their achievable hardware efficiency. Meanwhile, existing accelerators dedicated to NLP Transformers are not optimal for ViTs. This is because there is a large difference between ViTs and NLP Transformers: ViTs have a relatively fixed number of input tokens, whose attention maps can be pruned by up to 90% even with fixed sparse patterns; while NLP Transformers need to handle input sequences of varying numbers of tokens and rely on on-the-fly predictions of dynamic sparse attention patterns for each input to achieve a decent sparsity (e.g., >=50%). To this end, we propose a dedicated algorithm and accelerator co-design framework dubbed ViTCoD for accelerating ViTs. Specifically, on the algorithm level, ViTCoD prunes and polarizes the attention maps to have either denser or sparser fixed patterns for regularizing two levels of workloads without hurting the accuracy, largely reducing the attention computations while leaving room for alleviating the remaining dominant data movements; on top of that, we further integrate a lightweight and learnable auto-encoder module to enable trading the dominant high-cost data movements for lower-cost computations. On the hardware level, we develop a dedicated accelerator to simultaneously coordinate the enforced denser/sparser workloads and encoder/decoder engines for boosted hardware utilization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that ViTCoD largely reduces the dominant data movement costs, achieving speedups of up to 235.3x, 142.9x, 86.0x, 10.1x, and 6.8x over general computing platforms CPUs, EdgeGPUs, GPUs, and prior-art Transformer accelerators SpAtten and Sanger under an attention sparsity of 90%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to HPCA 2023</p></details> | None |

Lung nodules are common indicators of lung cancer, making their detection crucial. Various lung nodule detection models exist, but many lack efficiency. Hence, we propose a more efficient approach by leveraging 2D CT slices, reducing computational load and complexity in training and inference. We employ the tiny version of Swin Transformer to benefit from Vision Transformers (ViT) while maintaining low computational cost. A Feature Pyramid Network is added to enhance detection, particularly for small nodules. Additionally, Transfer Learning is used to accelerate training. Our experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher mAP and mAR for small nodules by 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Overall, our model achieves the highest mAP of 94.7% and mAR of 94.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th Iranian Conference on Intelligent Systems (ICIS), IEEE, 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[MRI super-resolution reconstruction using efficient diffusion probabilistic model with residual shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01576v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective:This study introduces a residual error-shifting mechanism that drastically reduces sampling steps while preserving critical anatomical details, thus accelerating MRI reconstruction. Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

This paper proposes a novel lightweight cross-spectral vision transformer (CS-ViT) for biometric authentication using forehead subcutaneous vein patterns and periocular patterns, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods, capable of performing well even with the face masks and without any physical touch. The proposed framework comprises a cross-spectral dual-channel architecture designed to handle two distinct biometric traits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative spectral patterns. Each channel consists of a Phase-Only Correlation Cross-Spectral Attention (POC-CSA) that captures their individual as well as correlated patterns. The computation of cross-spectral attention using POC extracts the phase correlation in the spatial features. Therefore, it is robust against the resolution/intensity variations and illumination of the input images, assuming both biometric traits are from the same person. The lightweight model is suitable for edge device deployment. The performance of the proposed algorithm was rigorously evaluated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database. The results demonstrated the superiority of the algorithm over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 98.8% with the combined vein and periocular patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TPAMI</p></details> | None |

While vision Transformers have exhibited impressive results in diverse dehazing tasks, their quadratic complexity and lack of dehazing priors pose significant drawbacks for real-world applications. In this paper, guided by triple priors, Bright Channel Prior (BCP), Dark Channel Prior (DCP), and Histogram Equalization (HE), we propose a \textit{P}rior-\textit{g}uided Hierarchical \textit{H}armonization Network (PGH$^2$Net) for image dehazing. PGH$^2$Net is built upon the UNet-like architecture with an efficient encoder and decoder, consisting of two module types: (1) Prior aggregation module that injects B/DCP and selects diverse contexts with gating attention. (2) Feature harmonization modules that subtract low-frequency components from spatial and channel aspects and learn more informative feature distributions to equalize the feature maps.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current tools including genomic assays lack the accuracy required for optimal clinical decision-making. We developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach that integrates digital pathology images with clinical data, providing a more robust and effective method for predicting the risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients. Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer pan-cancer foundation model trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized H&E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form a multi-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test was developed and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 female breast cancer patients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502 patients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remaining patients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our primary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five evaluation cohorts (C-index: 0.71 [0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p<0.001]). In a direct comparison (n=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay, achieving a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus 0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively. Additionally, the AI test added independent prognostic information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p<0.001)]). The test demonstrated robust accuracy across major molecular breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggest that our AI test improves upon the accuracy of existing prognostic tests, while being applicable to a wider range of patients.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the standard MLP blocks in each Transformer layer may not capture complex nonlinear dependencies optimally. In this paper, we propose ViKANformer, a Vision Transformer where we replace the MLP sub-layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) expansions, including Vanilla KAN, Efficient-KAN, Fast-KAN, SineKAN, and FourierKAN, while also examining a Flash Attention variant. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, which guarantees that multivariate continuous functions can be expressed via sums of univariate continuous functions, we aim to boost representational power. Experimental results on MNIST demonstrate that SineKAN, Fast-KAN, and a well-tuned Vanilla KAN can achieve over 97% accuracy, albeit with increased training overhead. This trade-off highlights that KAN expansions may be beneficial if computational cost is acceptable. We detail the expansions, present training/test accuracy and F1/ROC metrics, and provide pseudocode and hyperparameters for reproducibility. Finally, we compare ViKANformer to a simple MLP and a small CNN baseline on MNIST, illustrating the efficiency of Transformer-based methods even on a small-scale dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper represents ongoing research and may be subject to revisions, refinements, and additional experiments in future updates</p></details> | None |
| **[Evaluating and Predicting Distorted Human Body Parts for Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00811v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image synthesis, yet generating anatomically accurate human figures remains challenging. AI-generated images frequently exhibit distortions such as proliferated limbs, missing fingers, deformed extremities, or fused body parts. Existing evaluation metrics like Inception Score (IS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) lack the granularity to detect these distortions, while human preference-based metrics focus on abstract quality assessments rather than anatomical fidelity. To address this gap, we establish the first standards for identifying human body distortions in AI-generated images and introduce Distortion-5K, a comprehensive dataset comprising 4,700 annotated images of normal and malformed human figures across diverse styles and distortion types. Based on this dataset, we propose ViT-HD, a Vision Transformer-based model tailored for detecting human body distortions in AI-generated images, which outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models and visual language models, achieving an F1 score of 0.899 and IoU of 0.831 on distortion localization. Additionally, we construct the Human Distortion Benchmark with 500 human-centric prompts to evaluate four popular T2I models using trained ViT-HD, revealing that nearly 50\% of generated images contain distortions. This work pioneers a systematic approach to evaluating anatomical accuracy in AI-generated humans, offering tools to advance the fidelity of T2I models and their real-world applicability. The Distortion-5K dataset, trained ViT-HD will soon be released in our GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/TheRoadQaQ/Predicting-Distortion}{https://github.com/TheRoadQaQ/Predicting-Distortion}.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/TheRoadQaQ/Predicting-Distortion) |

The pair classifier can predict whether a given pair of images are from the same place or not. The network only comprises Vision Transformer components for both the encoder and the pair classifier, and both components are trained using their respective class tokens. In existing VPR methods, typically the network is initialized using pre-trained weights from a generic image dataset such as ImageNet. In this work we propose an alternative pre-training strategy, by using Siamese Masked Image Modelling as a pre-training task. We propose a Place-aware image sampling procedure from a collection of large VPR datasets for pre-training our model, to learn visual features tuned specifically for VPR. By re-using the Mask Image Modelling encoder and decoder weights in the second stage of training, Pair-VPR can achieve state-of-the-art VPR performance across five benchmark datasets with a ViT-B encoder, along with further improvements in localization recall with larger encoders.

We investigate three self-supervised learning methods (SimCLR, BYOL, MAE) with ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer architectures, assessing model generalization through leave-one-dataset-out experiments and data scaling analysis. Results show that pre-training on diverse datasets significantly improves generalization, with BYOL and MAE outperforming SimCLR, highlighting the efficacy of feature-consistency and generative learning over contrastive approaches. Data scaling experiments reveal that performance saturates at 60-70% of total data for BYOL and MAE, while SimCLR requires more data. These findings demonstrate that publicly available ECG data can match or surpass proprietary datasets in training robust ECG-FMs, paving the way for scalable, clinically meaningful AI-driven ECG analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HDKD: Hybrid Data-Efficient Knowledge Distillation Network for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07516v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved significant advancement in computer vision tasks due to their powerful modeling capacity. However, their performance notably degrades when trained with insufficient data due to lack of inherent inductive biases. Distilling knowledge and inductive biases from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) teacher has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the generalization of ViTs on limited datasets. Previous approaches to Knowledge Distillation (KD) have pursued two primary paths: some focused solely on distilling the logit distribution from CNN teacher to ViT student, neglecting the rich semantic information present in intermediate features due to the structural differences between them. Others integrated feature distillation along with logit distillation, yet this introduced alignment operations that limits the amount of knowledge transferred due to mismatched architectures and increased the computational overhead. To this end, this paper presents Hybrid Data-efficient Knowledge Distillation (HDKD) paradigm which employs a CNN teacher and a hybrid student. The choice of hybrid student serves two main aspects. First, it leverages the strengths of both convolutions and transformers while sharing the convolutional structure with the teacher model. Second, this shared structure enables the direct application of feature distillation without any information loss or additional computational overhead. Additionally, we propose an efficient light-weight convolutional block named Mobile Channel-Spatial Attention (MBCSA), which serves as the primary convolutional block in both teacher and student models. Extensive experiments on two medical public datasets showcase the superiority of HDKD over other state-of-the-art models and its computational efficiency.

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning.

| **[Split Adaptation for Pre-trained Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00441v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs), extensively pre-trained on large-scale datasets, have become essential to foundation models, allowing excellent performance on diverse downstream tasks with minimal adaptation. Consequently, there is growing interest in adapting pre-trained ViTs across various fields, including privacy-sensitive domains where clients are often reluctant to share their data. Existing adaptation methods typically require direct data access, rendering them infeasible under these constraints. A straightforward solution may be sending the pre-trained ViT to clients for local adaptation, which poses issues of model intellectual property protection and incurs heavy client computation overhead. To address these issues, we propose a novel split adaptation (SA) method that enables effective downstream adaptation while protecting data and models. SA, inspired by split learning (SL), segments the pre-trained ViT into a frontend and a backend, with only the frontend shared with the client for data representation extraction. But unlike regular SL, SA replaces frontend parameters with low-bit quantized values, preventing direct exposure of the model. SA allows the client to add bi-level noise to the frontend and the extracted data representations, ensuring data protection. Accordingly, SA incorporates data-level and model-level out-of-distribution enhancements to mitigate noise injection's impact on adaptation performance. Our SA focuses on the challenging few-shot adaptation and adopts patch retrieval augmentation for overfitting alleviation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate SA's superiority over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its defense against advanced data reconstruction attacks while preventing model leakage with minimal computation cost on the client side.

To mitigate these issues, there has been a concerted effort in post-hoc neural network pruning techniques that do not require costly retraining. Despite the considerable progress being made, existing methods often exhibit a steady drop in model performance as the compression increases. In this paper, we present a novel approach to compressing large transformers, coined OATS, that utilizes the second moment information in the input embeddings to decompose the model weights into a sum of sparse and low-rank matrices. Without any retraining, OATS achieves state-of-the-art performance when compressing models by up to $60\%$ on large language models such as Llama-3 and Phi-3 and vision transformers such as ViT and DINOv2 while delivering up to $1.37\times$ the CPU acceleration versus a model that was comparably pruned.</p></details> |  | None |

However, achieving a good balance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness remains a challenge. For instance, CNNs are computationally efficient but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs excel in capturing such dependencies but suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper proposes two ViT-based models for accurate, efficient, and robust 2D pose estimation. The first one, EViTPose, operates in a computationally efficient manner without sacrificing accuracy by utilizing learnable joint tokens to select and process a subset of the most important body patches, enabling us to control the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency by changing the number of patches to be processed. The second one, UniTransPose, while not allowing for the same level of direct control over the trade-off, efficiently handles multiple scales by combining (1) an efficient multi-scale transformer encoder that uses both local and global attention with (2) an efficient sub-pixel CNN decoder for better speed and accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating all joints from different benchmarks into a unified skeletal representation, we train robust methods that learn from multiple datasets simultaneously and perform well across a range of scenarios -- including pose variations, lighting conditions, and occlusions. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods while improving computational efficiency. EViTPose exhibits a significant decrease in computational complexity (30% to 44% less in GFLOPs) with a minimal drop of accuracy (0% to 3.5% less), and UniTransPose achieves accuracy improvements ranging from 0.9% to 43.8% across these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Albeit automated solutions are desirable, the limited availability of training data makes it difficult to develop such solutions using typical supervised learning frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy using more widely available unannotated head CT scan data to pre-train a 3D Vision Transformer model prior to fine-tuning for the aneurysm detection task. Specifically, we modify masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training in the following ways: we use a factorized self-attention mechanism to make 3D attention computationally viable, we restrict the masked patches to areas near arteries to focus on areas where aneurysms are likely to occur, and we reconstruct not only CT scan intensity values but also artery distance maps, which describe the distance between each voxel and the closest artery, thereby enhancing the backbone's learned representations. Compared with SOTA aneurysm detection models, our approach gains +4-8% absolute Sensitivity at a false positive rate of 0.5.

Our approach generates 1D identifiers based on the point descriptors, enabling direct retrieval in constant time. To adapt DSI to 3D data, we integrate Vision Transformers to map descriptors to these identifiers while incorporating positional and semantic encoding.

To mitigate these severe impacts, early fire detection and warning systems are crucial. Current systems rely primarily on fixed CCTV cameras with a limited field of view, restricting their effectiveness in large outdoor environments. The fusion of intelligent fire detection with remote sensing improves coverage and mobility, enabling monitoring in remote and challenging areas. Existing approaches predominantly utilize convolutional neural networks and vision transformer models. While these architectures provide high accuracy in fire detection, their computational complexity limits real-time performance on edge devices such as UAVs. In our work, we present a lightweight fire detection model based on MobileViT-S, compressed through the distillation of knowledge from a stronger teacher model. The ablation study highlights the impact of a teacher model and the chosen distillation technique on the model's performance improvement. We generate activation map visualizations using Grad-CAM to confirm the model's ability to focus on relevant fire regions. The high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model make it well-suited for deployment on satellites, UAVs, and IoT devices for effective fire detection. Experiments on common fire benchmarks demonstrate that our model suppresses the state-of-the-art model by 0.44%, 2.00% while maintaining a compact model size. Our model delivers the highest processing speed among existing works, achieving real-time performance on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  | None |

Four models contribute to downscaling the top-ranked GCMs to 0.1$^{\circ}$ resolution: Vision Transformer (ViT), Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoSTANet), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Effectively capturing temperature extremes (TXx, TNn), GeoSTANet achieves the highest accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.57$^{\circ}$C, Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.85, Correlation ($r$) = 0.92), so reducing RMSE by 20% over ConvLSTM. CNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM do well in Continental and Temperate zones; ViT finds fine-scale temperature fluctuations difficult. These results confirm that multi-criteria ranking improves GCM selection for regional climate studies and transformer-based downscaling exceeds conventional deep-learning methods. This framework offers a scalable method to enhance high-resolution climate projections, benefiting impact assessments and adaptation plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Environmental Science and Pollution Research (ESPR) for review</p></details> | None |
| **[If At First You Don't Succeed: Test Time Re-ranking for Zero-shot, Cross-domain Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17703v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel method for zero-shot, cross-domain image retrieval. Our key contribution is a test-time Iterative Cluster-free Re-ranking process that leverages gallery-gallery feature information to establish semantic links between query and gallery images. This enables the retrieval of relevant images even when they do not exhibit similar visual features but share underlying semantic concepts. This can be combined with any pre-existing cross-domain feature extraction backbone to improve retrieval performance. However, when combined with a carefully chosen Vision Transformer backbone and combination of zero-shot retrieval losses, our approach yields state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy, TU-Berlin and QuickDraw sketch-based retrieval benchmarks. We show that our re-ranking also improves performance with other backbones and outperforms other re-ranking methods applied with our backbone. Importantly, unlike many previous methods, none of the components in our approach are engineered specifically towards the sketch-based image retrieval task - it can be generally applied to any cross-domain, zero-shot retrieval task. We therefore also present new results on zero-shot cartoon-to-photo and art-to-product retrieval using the Office-Home dataset.

| **[Oscillation-Reduced MXFP4 Training for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20853v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training Transformers in FP4 precision is becoming a promising approach to gain substantial speedup, but it comes with a considerable loss of accuracy. Microscaling (MX) data format provides a fine-grained per-group quantization method to improve the representation ability of the FP4 format and is supported by the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture. However, training with MXFP4 data format still results in significant degradation and there is a lack of systematic research on the reason. In this work, we propose a novel training method TetraJet for a more accurate FP4 training. We comprehensively evaluate all of the quantizers involved in the training, and identify the weight oscillation problem in the forward pass as the main source of the degradation in MXFP4 training. Therefore, we introduce two novel methods, EMA Quantizer (Q-EMA) and Adaptive Ramping Optimizer (Q-Ramping), to resolve the oscillation problem. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers demonstrate that TetraJet consistently outperforms the existing 4-bit training methods, and Q-EMA & Q-Ramping can provide additional enhancement by effectively reducing oscillation. We decreased the accuracy degradation by more than $50\%$ compared to the baseline, and can even achieve competitive performance compared to full precision training.

Yet, efficiently adapting them for multiple tasks remains a challenge that arises from the need to modify the rich hidden representations encoded by the learned weight matrices, without inducing interference between tasks. Current parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, which apply low-rank updates, force tasks to compete within constrained subspaces, ultimately degrading performance. We introduce DiTASK a novel Diffeomorphic Multi-Task Fine-Tuning approach that maintains pre-trained representations by preserving weight matrix singular vectors, while enabling task-specific adaptations through neural diffeomorphic transformations of the singular values. By following this approach, DiTASK enables both shared and task-specific feature modulations with minimal added parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that DITASK achieves full-rank updates during optimization, preserving the geometric structure of pre-trained features, and establishing a new paradigm for efficient multi-task learning (MTL). Our experiments on PASCAL MTL and NYUD show that DiTASK achieves state-of-the-art performance across four dense prediction tasks, using 75% fewer parameters than existing methods.

| **[An Integrated Deep Learning Framework Leveraging NASNet and Vision Transformer with MixProcessing for Accurate and Precise Diagnosis of Lung Diseases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20570v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lungs are the essential organs of respiration, and this system is significant in the carbon dioxide and exchange between oxygen that occurs in human life. However, several lung diseases, which include pneumonia, tuberculosis, COVID-19, and lung cancer, are serious healthiness challenges and demand early and precise diagnostics. The methodological study has proposed a new deep learning framework called NASNet-ViT, which effectively incorporates the convolution capability of NASNet with the global attention mechanism capability of Vision Transformer ViT. The proposed model will classify the lung conditions into five classes: Lung cancer, COVID-19, pneumonia, TB, and normal. A sophisticated multi-faceted preprocessing strategy called MixProcessing has been used to improve diagnostic accuracy. This preprocessing combines wavelet transform, adaptive histogram equalization, and morphological filtering techniques. The NASNet-ViT model performs at state of the art, achieving an accuracy of 98.9%, sensitivity of 0.99, an F1-score of 0.989, and specificity of 0.987, outperforming other state of the art architectures such as MixNet-LD, D-ResNet, MobileNet, and ResNet50. The model's efficiency is further emphasized by its compact size, 25.6 MB, and a low computational time of 12.4 seconds, hence suitable for real-time, clinically constrained environments. These results reflect the high-quality capability of NASNet-ViT in extracting meaningful features and recognizing various types of lung diseases with very high accuracy. This work contributes to medical image analysis by providing a robust and scalable solution for diagnostics in lung diseases.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we revisit the stability of the vanilla FedAvg algorithm under diverse conditions. Despite its conceptual simplicity, FedAvg exhibits remarkably stable performance compared to more advanced FL techniques. Our experiments assess the performance of various FL methods on blood cell and skin lesion classification tasks using Vision Transformer (ViT). Additionally, we evaluate the impact of different representative classification models and analyze sensitivity to hyperparameter variations. The results consistently demonstrate that, regardless of dataset, classification model employed, or hyperparameter settings, FedAvg maintains robust performance. Given its stability, robust performance without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, FedAvg is a safe and efficient choice for FL deployments in resource-constrained hospitals handling medical data. These findings underscore the enduring value of the vanilla FedAvg approach as a trusted baseline for clinical practice.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |
| **[Lightweight Vision Transformer with Bidirectional Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00396v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision backbones have significantly improved their performance by simultaneously modeling images' local and global contexts. However, the bidirectional interaction between these two contexts has not been well explored and exploited, which is important in the human visual system. This paper proposes a Fully Adaptive Self-Attention (FASA) mechanism for vision transformer to model the local and global information as well as the bidirectional interaction between them in context-aware ways. Specifically, FASA employs self-modulated convolutions to adaptively extract local representation while utilizing self-attention in down-sampled space to extract global representation. Subsequently, it conducts a bidirectional adaptation process between local and global representation to model their interaction. In addition, we introduce a fine-grained downsampling strategy to enhance the down-sampled self-attention mechanism for finer-grained global perception capability. Based on FASA, we develop a family of lightweight vision backbones, Fully Adaptive Transformer (FAT) family. Extensive experiments on multiple vision tasks demonstrate that FAT achieves impressive performance. Notably, FAT accomplishes a 77.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K using only 4.5M parameters and 0.7G FLOPs, which surpasses the most advanced ConvNets and Transformers with similar model size and computational costs. Moreover, our model exhibits faster speed on modern GPU compared to other models.

| **[RMT: Retentive Networks Meet Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11523v6)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained increasing attention in the computer vision community in recent years. However, the core component of ViT, Self-Attention, lacks explicit spatial priors and bears a quadratic computational complexity, thereby constraining the applicability of ViT. To alleviate these issues, we draw inspiration from the recent Retentive Network (RetNet) in the field of NLP, and propose RMT, a strong vision backbone with explicit spatial prior for general purposes. Specifically, we extend the RetNet's temporal decay mechanism to the spatial domain, and propose a spatial decay matrix based on the Manhattan distance to introduce the explicit spatial prior to Self-Attention. Additionally, an attention decomposition form that adeptly adapts to explicit spatial prior is proposed, aiming to reduce the computational burden of modeling global information without disrupting the spatial decay matrix. Based on the spatial decay matrix and the attention decomposition form, we can flexibly integrate explicit spatial prior into the vision backbone with linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMT exhibits exceptional performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without extra training data, RMT achieves **84.8%** and **86.1%** top-1 acc on ImageNet-1k with **27M/4.5GFLOPs** and **96M/18.2GFLOPs**. For downstream tasks, RMT achieves **54.5** box AP and **47.2** mask AP on the COCO detection task, and **52.8** mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task.

| **[SAC-ViT: Semantic-Aware Clustering Vision Transformer with Early Exit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00060v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) excels in global modeling but faces deployment challenges on resource-constrained devices due to the quadratic computational complexity of its attention mechanism. To address this, we propose the Semantic-Aware Clustering Vision Transformer (SAC-ViT), a non-iterative approach to enhance ViT's computational efficiency. SAC-ViT operates in two stages: Early Exit (EE) and Semantic-Aware Clustering (SAC). In the EE stage, downsampled input images are processed to extract global semantic information and generate initial inference results. If these results do not meet the EE termination criteria, the information is clustered into target and non-target tokens. In the SAC stage, target tokens are mapped back to the original image, cropped, and embedded. These target tokens are then combined with reused non-target tokens from the EE stage, and the attention mechanism is applied within each cluster. This two-stage design, with end-to-end optimization, reduces spatial redundancy and enhances computational efficiency, significantly boosting overall ViT performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of SAC-ViT, reducing 62% of the FLOPs of DeiT and achieving 1.98 times throughput without compromising performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Vision Transformers on the Edge: A Comprehensive Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02891v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful and promising techniques for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire further research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient deployment on edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |

The traditional diagnostic approach for GON involves a set of ophthalmic examinations, which are time-consuming and require a visit to an ophthalmologist. Recent deep learning models for automating GON detection from digital fundus images (DFI) have shown promise but often suffer from limited generalizability across different ethnicities, disease groups and examination settings. To address these limitations, we introduce GONet, a robust deep learning model developed using seven independent datasets, including over 119,000 DFIs with gold-standard annotations and from patients of diverse geographic backgrounds. GONet consists of a DINOv2 pre-trained self-supervised vision transformers fine-tuned using a multisource domain strategy. GONet demonstrated high out-of-distribution generalizability, with an AUC of 0.85-0.99 in target domains. GONet performance was similar or superior to state-of-the-art works and was significantly superior to the cup-to-disc ratio, by up to 21.6%. GONet is available at [URL provided on publication]. We also contribute a new dataset consisting of 768 DFI with GON labels as open access.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering</p></details> | None |

Inspired by the brain's mechanisms for categorization and analogical learning, we propose a novel approach called Brain-inspired Analogical Mixture Prototypes (BAMP). BAMP has three components: mixed prototypical feature learning, statistical analogy, and soft voting. Starting from a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT), mixed prototypical feature learning represents each class using a mixture of prototypes and fine-tunes these representations during the base session. The statistical analogy calibrates the mean and covariance matrix of prototypes for new classes according to similarity to the base classes, and computes classification score with Mahalanobis distance. Soft voting combines both merits of statistical analogy and an off-shelf FSCIL method. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that BAMP outperforms state-of-the-art on both traditional big start FSCIL setting and challenging small start FSCIL setting. The study suggests that brain-inspired analogical mixture prototypes can alleviate catastrophic forgetting and over-fitting problems in FSCIL.</p></details> | under review | None |
| **[SGFormer: Spherical Geometry Transformer for 360 Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14979v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic distortion poses a significant challenge in 360 depth estimation, particularly pronounced at the north and south poles. Existing methods either adopt a bi-projection fusion strategy to remove distortions or model long-range dependencies to capture global structures, which can result in either unclear structure or insufficient local perception. In this paper, we propose a spherical geometry transformer, named SGFormer, to address the above issues, with an innovative step to integrate spherical geometric priors into vision transformers. To this end, we retarget the transformer decoder to a spherical prior decoder (termed SPDecoder), which endeavors to uphold the integrity of spherical structures during decoding. Concretely, we leverage bipolar re-projection, circular rotation, and curve local embedding to preserve the spherical characteristics of equidistortion, continuity, and surface distance, respectively. Furthermore, we present a query-based global conditional position embedding to compensate for spatial structure at varying resolutions. It not only boosts the global perception of spatial position but also sharpens the depth structure across different patches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, demonstrating our superiority over state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we posit that the very same strength can make applications based on FMs vulnerable to model stealing attacks. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that models fine-tuned from FMs harbor heightened susceptibility to model stealing, compared to conventional vision architectures like ResNets. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the comprehensive encoding of visual patterns and features learned by FMs during pre-training, which are accessible to both the attacker and the victim. We report that an attacker is able to obtain 94.28% agreement (matched predictions with victim) for a Vision Transformer based victim model (ViT-L/16) trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, compared to only 73.20% agreement for a ResNet-18 victim, when using ViT-L/16 as the thief model. We arguably show, for the first time, that utilizing FMs for downstream tasks may not be the best choice for deployment in commercial APIs due to their susceptibility to model theft. We thereby alert model owners towards the associated security risks, and highlight the need for robust security measures to safeguard such models against theft.

In this paper, we address the critical question: Can we escape the big data paradigm in self-supervised representation learning from images? We introduce SCOTT (Sparse Convolutional Tokenizer for Transformers), a shallow tokenization architecture that is compatible with Masked Image Modeling (MIM) tasks. SCOTT injects convolutional inductive biases into Vision Transformers (ViTs), enhancing their efficacy in small-scale data regimes. Alongside, we propose to train on a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture within a MIM framework (MIM-JEPA), operating in latent representation space to capture more semantic features. Our approach enables ViTs to be trained from scratch on datasets orders of magnitude smaller than traditionally required --without relying on massive external datasets for pretraining. We validate our method on three small-size, standard-resoultion, fine-grained datasets: Oxford Flowers-102, Oxford IIIT Pets-37, and ImageNet-100. Despite the challenges of limited data and high intra-class similarity, frozen SCOTT models pretrained with MIM-JEPA significantly outperform fully supervised methods and achieve competitive results with SOTA approaches that rely on large-scale pretraining, complex image augmentations and bigger model sizes. By demonstrating that robust off-the-shelf representations can be learned with limited data, compute, and model sizes, our work paves the way for computer applications in resource constrained environments such as medical imaging or robotics. Our findings challenge the prevailing notion that vast amounts of data are indispensable for effective representation learning in vision, offering a new pathway toward more accessible and inclusive advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and implementation available at: https://github.com/inescopresearch/scott</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/inescopresearch/scott) |

The severity of this situation calls for innovative diagnosis method for cardiovascular diseases. This article aims to explore efficient, light-weight and rapid methods for arrhythmia diagnosis, in resource-constrained healthcare settings. Due to the lack of Romanian public medical data, we trained our systems using international public datasets, having in mind that the ECG signals are the same regardless the patients' nationality. Within this purpose, we combined multiple datasets, usually used in the field of arrhythmias classification: PTB-XL electrocardiography dataset , PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, China 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database, Georgia 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database, and St. Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database. For the input data, we employed ECG signal processing methods, specifically a variant of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, useful in arrhythmia classification because it provides a robust and efficient method for detecting QRS complexes in ECG signals. Additionally, we used machine learning techniques, widely used for the task of classification, including convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs, 2D CNNs, ResNet) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The systems were evaluated in terms of accuracy and F1 score. We annalysed our dataset from two perspectives. First, we fed the systems with the ECG signals and the GRU-based 1D CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 93.4% among all the tested architectures. Secondly, we transformed ECG signals into images and the CNN2D model achieved an accuracy of 92.16%.</p></details> | 34 pages, 17 figures | None |

Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous paradigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on ViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the existing paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask Decoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT really need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we investigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the effectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context Replay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the ViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real pyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier mock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality in the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation studies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We conducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that VPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective design. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the long-established mIoU wall/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report, minor fix</p></details> | None |

Building on a geometric theory of neural representations, we show representational geometries that predict generalization. Layer-wise analysis reveals distinct relational reasoning strategies across models and suggests a trade-off where unseen rule representations compress into training-shaped subspaces. Guided by our geometric perspective, we propose and evaluate SNRloss, a novel objective balancing representation geometry. Our findings offer geometric insights into how neural networks generalize abstract relations, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 7 figures, 8 SI figures, 2 SI tables</p></details> | None |

Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Whole Slide Images (WSI) plays a crucial role by providing detailed tissue samples for the analysis and training of DL models. However, WSIs often contain regions with artifacts such as tissue folds, blurring, as well as non-tissue regions (background), which can negatively impact DL model performance. These artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant and can lead to inaccurate results. This paper proposes a fully automatic supervised DL pipeline for WSI Quality Assessment (WSI-QA) that uses a fused model combining CNNs and ViTs to detect and exclude WSI regions with artifacts, ensuring that only qualified WSI regions are used to build DL-based computational pathology applications. The proposed pipeline employs a pixel-based segmentation model to classify WSI regions as either qualified or non-qualified based on the presence of artifacts. The proposed model was trained on a large and diverse dataset and validated with internal and external data from various human organs, scanners, and H&E staining procedures. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WSI artifact detection. The proposed model consistently achieved over 95% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across all artifact types. Furthermore, the WSI-QA pipeline shows strong generalization across different tissue types and scanning conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis journal, February 2025</p></details> | None |

If not detected and treated early, it can cause permanent vision loss. Computer-assisted diagnosis systems play a crucial role in timely and efficient identification. This study introduces MaxGlaViT, a lightweight model based on the restructured Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) for early glaucoma detection. First, MaxViT was scaled to optimize block and channel numbers, resulting in a lighter architecture. Second, the stem was enhanced by adding attention mechanisms (CBAM, ECA, SE) after convolution layers to improve feature learning. Third, MBConv structures in MaxViT blocks were replaced by advanced DL blocks (ConvNeXt, ConvNeXtV2, InceptionNeXt). The model was evaluated using the HDV1 dataset, containing fundus images of different glaucoma stages. Additionally, 40 CNN and 40 ViT models were tested on HDV1 to validate MaxGlaViT's efficiency. Among CNN models, EfficientB6 achieved the highest accuracy (84.91%), while among ViT models, MaxViT-Tiny performed best (86.42%). The scaled MaxViT reached 87.93% accuracy. Adding ECA to the stem block increased accuracy to 89.01%. Replacing MBConv with ConvNeXtV2 further improved it to 89.87%. Finally, integrating ECA in the stem and ConvNeXtV2 in MaxViT blocks resulted in 92.03% accuracy.

However, it remains challenging due to the complex nature of scenes and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce Mask2Alpha, an iterative refinement framework designed to enhance semantic comprehension, instance awareness, and fine-detail recovery in image matting.

However, diverse experimental conditions, spanning multiple input domains, prevent a fair comparison based solely on reported results, posing challenges for model selection. To address this gap in comparability, we perform a large-scale benchmark of more than 45 models for image classification, evaluating key efficiency aspects, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage. Our benchmark provides a standardized baseline for efficiency-oriented transformers. We analyze the results based on the Pareto front -- the boundary of optimal models. Surprisingly, despite claims of other models being more efficient, ViT remains Pareto optimal across multiple metrics. We observe that hybrid attention-CNN models exhibit remarkable inference memory- and parameter-efficiency. Moreover, our benchmark shows that using a larger model in general is more efficient than using higher resolution images. Thanks to our holistic evaluation, we provide a centralized resource for practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting or developing efficient transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: n...</summary><p>v3: new models, analysis of scaling behaviors; v4: WACV 2025 camera ready version, appendix added</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a global-local progressive integration model that addresses this challenge through three key contributions: 1) We develop a dual-measurement framework that combines vision Transformer (ViT)-based global feature extractor and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature extractor to comprehensively capture and quantify image distortion characteristics at different granularities. 2) We propose a progressive feature integration scheme that utilizes multi-scale kernel configurations to align global and local features, and progressively aggregates them via an interactive stack of channel-wise self-attention and spatial interaction modules for multi-grained quality-aware representations. 3) We introduce a semantic-aligned quality transfer method that extends the training data by automatically labeling the quality scores of diverse image content with subjective opinion scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our model yields 5.04% and 5.40% improvements in Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) for cross-authentic and cross-synthetic dataset generalization tests, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed semantic-aligned quality transfer further yields 2.26% and 13.23% performance gains in evaluations on single-synthetic and cross-synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Natural images display intricate arrangements encompassing numerous extraneous elements. Vision transformers utilize localized patches to compute attention. However, exclusive dependence on patch segmentation proves inadequate in sufficiently encompassing the comprehensive nature of the image. To address this issue, we have proposed an inner-outer transformer-based architecture, which gives attention to the global and local aspects of the image. Moreover, The training of transformer models poses significant challenges due to their demanding resource, time, and data requirements. To tackle this, we integrate knowledge distillation into the architecture, enabling efficient learning. Leveraging insights from a larger teacher model, our approach enhances learning efficiency and effectiveness. Significantly, the transformer-in-transformer network acquires lightweight characteristics by means of distillation conducted within the feature extraction layer. Our featured network's robustness is established through substantial experimentation on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, demonstrating commendable top-1 and top-5 accuracy. The conducted ablative analysis comprehensively validates the effectiveness of the chosen parameters and settings, showcasing their superiority against contemporary methodologies. Remarkably, the proposed Transformer-in-Transformer Network (TITN) model achieves impressive performance milestones across various datasets: securing the highest top-1 accuracy of 74.71% and a top-5 accuracy of 92.28% for the CIFAR100 dataset, attaining an unparalleled top-1 accuracy of 92.03% and top-5 accuracy of 99.80% for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and registering an exceptional top-1 accuracy of 99.56% for the MNIST dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

While various model compression strategies have been well studied, parameter sharing remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Fine-grained Parameter Sharing (FiPS), a novel algorithm that leverages parameter sharing, tensor decomposition, and sparsity to effectively compress large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). FiPS employs a shared base and sparse factors to represent neurons across multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, where initialization is guided by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and subsequent optimization is conducted through block-wise reconstruction error minimization. Experimental results show that FiPS reduces the parameter budget of MLP modules by 50-75% for DeiT-B and Swin-L and by 40-50% for various Gemma-2 and Llama-3 models while maintaining ViT model accuracy within 1% pt. of the original and LLM perplexity with negligible degradation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on neural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to known biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification typically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we introduce Entropy-Lens, a scalable, model-agnostic framework that leverages information theory to interpret frozen, off-the-shelf large-scale transformers. By quantifying the evolution of Shannon entropy within intermediate residual streams, our approach extracts computational signatures that distinguish model families, categorize task-specific prompts, and correlate with output accuracy. We further demonstrate the generality of our method by extending the analysis to vision transformers.

However, our investigation reveals that most existing MLLMs are constrained by the absence of high-quality, large-scale, real-world datasets, resulting in inadequate performance in automated webpage code generation. To fill this gap, this paper introduces WebCode2M, a new dataset comprising 2.56 million instances, each containing a design image along with the corresponding webpage code and layout details. Sourced from real-world web resources, WebCode2M offers a rich and valuable dataset for webpage code generation across a variety of applications. The dataset quality is ensured by a scoring model that filters out instances with aesthetic deficiencies or other incomplete elements. To validate the effectiveness of WebCode2M, we introduce a baseline model based on the Vision Transformer (ViT), named WebCoder, and establish a benchmark for fair comparison. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, TreeBLEU, to measure the structural hierarchy recall. The benchmarking results demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the ability of MLLMs to generate code from webpage designs, confirming its effectiveness and usability for future applications in front-end design tools. Finally, we highlight several practical challenges introduced by our dataset, calling for further research.

| **[FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16025v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Model Transferability of Adversarial Patches in Real-time Segmentation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16012v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models, particularly in safety-critical applications like healthcare and autonomous driving. Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in real-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following this idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic for autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a 'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this attack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized on a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a comprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches trained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S, PIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the Segformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of our analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study reveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs. Transformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude that although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images of any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular model are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true for both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that for CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike ViTs. Per-class analysis reveals that simple-classes like 'sky' suffer less misclassification than others.

These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and achieving high generalization in segmentation tasks. However, adapting these large models to medical image analysis presents several challenges, including domain differences between medical and natural images, the need for efficient model adaptation strategies, and the limitations of small-scale medical datasets. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on the adaptation of VFMs to medical image segmentation, focusing on the challenges of domain adaptation, model compression, and federated learning. We discuss the latest developments in adapter-based improvements, knowledge distillation techniques, and multi-scale contextual feature modeling, and propose future directions to overcome these bottlenecks. Our analysis highlights the potential of VFMs, along with emerging methodologies such as federated learning and model compression, to revolutionize medical image analysis and enhance clinical applications.

Our approach, Jumbo, creates a wider CLS token, which is split to match the patch token width before attention, processed with self-attention, and reassembled. After attention, Jumbo applies a dedicated, wider FFN to this token. Jumbo significantly improves over ViT+Registers on ImageNet-1K at high speeds (by 3.2% for ViT-tiny and 13.5% for ViT-nano); these Jumbo models even outperform specialized compute-efficient models while preserving the architectural advantages of plain ViTs. Although Jumbo sees no gains for ViT-small on ImageNet-1K, it gains 3.4% on ImageNet-21K over ViT+Registers. Both findings indicate that Jumbo is most helpful when the ViT is otherwise too narrow for the task. Finally, we show that Jumbo can be easily adapted to excel on data beyond images, e.g., time series.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns.

The method does not aim to explain the model's prediction but to answer questions such as which parts of the image are processed similarly or which information is kept in deeper layers. Experimentally, we leverage NAVE to show that the training dataset and the level of supervision affect which concepts are captured.

Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately.

However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate sleep staging and disorder detection are crucial for assessing sleep quality. Studies in the literature have proposed PSG-based approaches and machine-learning methods utilizing single-modality signals. However, existing methods often lack multimodal, multilabel frameworks and address sleep stages and disorders classification separately. In this paper, we propose a 1D-Vision Transformer for simultaneous classification of sleep stages and sleep disorders. Our method exploits the sleep disorders' correlation with specific sleep stage patterns and performs a simultaneous identification of a sleep stage and sleep disorder. The model is trained and tested using multimodal-multilabel sensory data (including photoplethysmogram, respiratory flow, and respiratory effort signals). The proposed method shows an overall accuracy (cohen's Kappa) of 78% (0.66) for five-stage sleep classification and 74% (0.58) for sleep apnea classification. Moreover, we analyzed the encoder attention weights to clarify our models' predictions and investigate the influence different features have on the models' outputs. The result shows that identified patterns, such as respiratory troughs and peaks, make a higher contribution to the final classification process.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a significant performance gap still exists between SNN-based ViTs and their ANN counterparts. Here, we first analyze why SNN-based ViTs suffer from limited performance and identify a mismatch between the vanilla self-attention mechanism and spatio-temporal spike trains. This mismatch results in degraded spatial relevance and limited temporal interactions. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from biological saccadic attention mechanisms and introduce an innovative Saccadic Spike Self-Attention (SSSA) method. Specifically, in the spatial domain, SSSA employs a novel spike distribution-based method to effectively assess the relevance between Query and Key pairs in SNN-based ViTs. Temporally, SSSA employs a saccadic interaction module that dynamically focuses on selected visual areas at each timestep and significantly enhances whole scene understanding through temporal interactions. Building on the SSSA mechanism, we develop a SNN-based Vision Transformer (SNN-ViT). Extensive experiments across various visual tasks demonstrate that SNN-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear computational complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of the SNN-ViT highlight its potential for power-critical edge vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

| **[GVTNet: Graph Vision Transformer For Face Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12570v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in face super-resolution research have utilized the Transformer architecture. This method processes the input image into a series of small patches. However, because of the strong correlation between different facial components in facial images. When it comes to super-resolution of low-resolution images, existing algorithms cannot handle the relationships between patches well, resulting in distorted facial components in the super-resolution results. To solve the problem, we propose a transformer architecture based on graph neural networks called graph vision transformer network. We treat each patch as a graph node and establish an adjacency matrix based on the information between patches. In this way, the patch only interacts between neighboring patches, further processing the relationship of facial components. Quantitative and visualization experiments have underscored the superiority of our algorithm over state-of-the-art techniques. Through detailed comparisons, we have demonstrated that our algorithm possesses more advanced super-resolution capabilities, particularly in enhancing facial components.

| **[Multi Image Super Resolution Modeling for Earth System Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12427v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-resolution (SR) techniques are essential for improving Earth System Model (ESM) data's spatial resolution, which helps better understand complex environmental processes. This paper presents a new algorithm, ViFOR, which combines Vision Transformers (ViT) and Implicit Neural Representation Networks (INRs) to generate High-Resolution (HR) images from Low-Resolution (LR) inputs. ViFOR introduces a novel integration of Fourier-based activation functions within the Vision Transformer architecture, enabling it to effectively capture global context and high-frequency details critical for accurate SR reconstruction. The results show that ViFOR outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as ViT, Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIREN), and SR Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) based on metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) both for global as well as the local imagery. ViFOR improves PSNR of up to 4.18 dB, 1.56 dB, and 1.73 dB over ViT for full images in the Source Temperature, Shortwave, and Longwave Flux.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[OCT Data is All You Need: How Vision Transformers with and without Pre-training Benefit Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12379v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides high-resolution cross-sectional images useful for diagnosing various diseases, but their distinct characteristics from natural images raise questions about whether large-scale pre-training on datasets like ImageNet is always beneficial. In this paper, we investigate the impact of ImageNet-based pre-training on Vision Transformer (ViT) performance for OCT image classification across different dataset sizes. Our experiments cover four-category retinal pathologies (CNV, DME, Drusen, Normal). Results suggest that while pre-training can accelerate convergence and potentially offer better performance in smaller datasets, training from scratch may achieve comparable or even superior accuracy when sufficient OCT data is available. Our findings highlight the importance of matching domain characteristics in pre-training and call for further study on large-scale OCT-specific pre-training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DINeuro: Distilling Knowledge from 2D Natural Images via Deformable Tubular Transferring Strategy for 3D Neuron Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22078v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing neuron morphology from 3D light microscope imaging data is critical to aid neuroscientists in analyzing brain networks and neuroanatomy. With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space. The experimental results on the Janelia dataset of the BigNeuron project demonstrate that our method achieves a segmentation performance improvement of 4.53% in mean Dice and 3.56% in mean 95% Hausdorff distance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, and 2 tables.

| **[Compress image to patches for Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10120v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision Transformer (ViT) has made significant strides in the field of computer vision. However, as the depth of the model and the resolution of the input images increase, the computational cost associated with training and running ViT models has surged dramatically. This paper proposes a hybrid model based on CNN and Vision Transformer, named CI2P-ViT. The model incorporates a module called CI2P, which utilizes the CompressAI encoder to compress images and subsequently generates a sequence of patches through a series of convolutions. CI2P can replace the Patch Embedding component in the ViT model, enabling seamless integration into existing ViT models. Compared to ViT-B/16, CI2P-ViT has the number of patches input to the self-attention layer reduced to a quarter of the original. This design not only significantly reduces the computational cost of the ViT model but also effectively enhances the model's accuracy by introducing the inductive bias properties of CNN. The ViT model's precision is markedly enhanced. When trained from the ground up on the Animals-10 dataset, CI2P-ViT achieved an accuracy rate of 92.37%, representing a 3.3% improvement over the ViT-B/16 baseline. Additionally, the model's computational operations, measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPs), were diminished by 63.35%, and it exhibited a 2-fold increase in training velocity on identical hardware configurations.</p></details> | 15 pages,5 figures | None |
| **[UbiMoE: A Ubiquitous Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformer Accelerator With Hybrid Computation Pattern on FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05602v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to traditional Vision Transformers (ViT), Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformers (MoE-ViT) are introduced to scale model size without a proportional increase in computational complexity, making them a new research focus. Given the high performance and reconfigurability, FPGA-based accelerators for MoE-ViT emerge, delivering substantial gains over general-purpose processors. However, existing accelerators often fall short of fully exploring the design space, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between resource utilization and performance. To overcome this problem, we introduce UbiMoE, a novel end-to-end FPGA accelerator tailored for MoE-ViT. Leveraging the unique computational and memory access patterns of MoE-ViTs, we develop a latency-optimized streaming attention kernel and a resource-efficient reusable linear kernel, effectively balancing performance and resource consumption. To further enhance design efficiency, we propose a two-stage heuristic search algorithm that optimally tunes hardware parameters for various FPGA resource constraints. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) FPGA designs, UbiMoE achieves 1.34x and 3.35x throughput improvements for MoE-ViT on Xilinx ZCU102 and Alveo U280 platforms, respectively, while enhancing energy efficiency by 1.75x and 1.54x.

| **[Neural Slot Interpreters: Grounding Object Semantics in Emergent Slot Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07887v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several accounts of human cognition posit that our intelligence is rooted in our ability to form abstract composable concepts, ground them in our environment, and reason over these grounded entities. This trifecta of human thought has remained elusive in modern intelligent machines. In this work, we investigate whether slot representations extracted from visual scenes serve as appropriate compositional abstractions for grounding and reasoning. We present the Neural Slot Interpreter (NSI), which learns to ground object semantics in slots. At the core of NSI is an XML-like schema that uses simple syntax rules to organize the object semantics of a scene into object-centric schema primitives. Then, the NSI metric learns to ground primitives into slots through a structured contrastive learning objective that reasons over the intermodal alignment. Experiments with a bi-modal object-property and scene retrieval task demonstrate the grounding efficacy and interpretability of correspondences learned by NSI. From a scene representation standpoint, we find that emergent NSI slots that move beyond the image grid by binding to spatial objects facilitate improved visual grounding compared to conventional bounding-box-based approaches. From a data efficiency standpoint, we empirically validate that NSI learns more generalizable representations from a fixed amount of annotation data than the traditional approach. We also show that the grounded slots surpass unsupervised slots in real-world object discovery and scale with scene complexity. Finally, we investigate the reasoning abilities of the grounded slots. Vision Transformers trained on grounding-aware NSI tokenizers using as few as ten tokens outperform patch-based tokens on challenging few-shot classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ExPLoRA: Parameter-Efficient Extended Pre-Training to Adapt Vision Transformers under Domain Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10973v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can effectively adapt large pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks using only a small fraction (0.1%-10%) of the original trainable weights. An under-explored question of PEFT is in extending the pre-training phase without supervised labels; that is, can we adapt a pre-trained foundation model to a new domain via efficient self-supervised pre-training on this new domain? In this work, we introduce ExPLoRA, a highly effective technique to improve transfer learning of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) under domain shifts. Initializing a ViT with pre-trained weights on large, natural-image datasets such as from DinoV2 or MAE, ExPLoRA continues the unsupervised pre-training objective on a new domain, unfreezing 1-2 pre-trained ViT blocks and tuning all other layers with LoRA. We then fine-tune the resulting model only with LoRA on this new domain for supervised learning. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on satellite imagery, even outperforming fully pre-training and fine-tuning ViTs. Using the DinoV2 training objective, we demonstrate up to 8% improvement in linear probing top-1 accuracy on downstream tasks while using <10% of the number of parameters that are used in prior fully-tuned state-of-the art approaches. Our ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our approach over other baselines, including PEFT and unfreezing more ViT blocks.
