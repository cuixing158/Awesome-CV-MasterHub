| **[SGFormer: Spherical Geometry Transformer for 360 Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14979v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic distortion poses a significant challenge in 360 depth estimation, particularly pronounced at the north and south poles. Existing methods either adopt a bi-projection fusion strategy to remove distortions or model long-range dependencies to capture global structures, which can result in either unclear structure or insufficient local perception. In this paper, we propose a spherical geometry transformer, named SGFormer, to address the above issues, with an innovative step to integrate spherical geometric priors into vision transformers. To this end, we retarget the transformer decoder to a spherical prior decoder (termed SPDecoder), which endeavors to uphold the integrity of spherical structures during decoding. Concretely, we leverage bipolar re-projection, circular rotation, and curve local embedding to preserve the spherical characteristics of equidistortion, continuity, and surface distance, respectively. Furthermore, we present a query-based global conditional position embedding to compensate for spatial structure at varying resolutions. It not only boosts the global perception of spatial position but also sharpens the depth structure across different patches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, demonstrating our superiority over state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Examining the Threat Landscape: Foundation Models and Model Stealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18077v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) for computer vision learn rich and robust representations, enabling their adaptation to task/domain-specific deployments with little to no fine-tuning. However, we posit that the very same strength can make applications based on FMs vulnerable to model stealing attacks. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that models fine-tuned from FMs harbor heightened susceptibility to model stealing, compared to conventional vision architectures like ResNets. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the comprehensive encoding of visual patterns and features learned by FMs during pre-training, which are accessible to both the attacker and the victim. We report that an attacker is able to obtain 94.28% agreement (matched predictions with victim) for a Vision Transformer based victim model (ViT-L/16) trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, compared to only 73.20% agreement for a ResNet-18 victim, when using ViT-L/16 as the thief model. We arguably show, for the first time, that utilizing FMs for downstream tasks may not be the best choice for deployment in commercial APIs due to their susceptibility to model theft. We thereby alert model owners towards the associated security risks, and highlight the need for robust security measures to safeguard such models against theft.

| **[Escaping The Big Data Paradigm in Self-Supervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18056v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliance on large-scale datasets and extensive computational resources has become a major barrier to advancing representation learning in vision, especially in data-scarce domains. In this paper, we address the critical question: Can we escape the big data paradigm in self-supervised representation learning from images? We introduce SCOTT (Sparse Convolutional Tokenizer for Transformers), a shallow tokenization architecture that is compatible with Masked Image Modeling (MIM) tasks. SCOTT injects convolutional inductive biases into Vision Transformers (ViTs), enhancing their efficacy in small-scale data regimes. Alongside, we propose to train on a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture within a MIM framework (MIM-JEPA), operating in latent representation space to capture more semantic features. Our approach enables ViTs to be trained from scratch on datasets orders of magnitude smaller than traditionally required --without relying on massive external datasets for pretraining. We validate our method on three small-size, standard-resoultion, fine-grained datasets: Oxford Flowers-102, Oxford IIIT Pets-37, and ImageNet-100. Despite the challenges of limited data and high intra-class similarity, frozen SCOTT models pretrained with MIM-JEPA significantly outperform fully supervised methods and achieve competitive results with SOTA approaches that rely on large-scale pretraining, complex image augmentations and bigger model sizes. By demonstrating that robust off-the-shelf representations can be learned with limited data, compute, and model sizes, our work paves the way for computer applications in resource constrained environments such as medical imaging or robotics. Our findings challenge the prevailing notion that vast amounts of data are indispensable for effective representation learning in vision, offering a new pathway toward more accessible and inclusive advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and implementation available at: https://github.com/inescopresearch/scott</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/inescopresearch/scott) |
| **[Arrhythmia Classification from 12-Lead ECG Signals Using Convolutional and Transformer-Based Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17887v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Romania, cardiovascular problems are the leading cause of death, accounting for nearly one-third of annual fatalities. The severity of this situation calls for innovative diagnosis method for cardiovascular diseases. This article aims to explore efficient, light-weight and rapid methods for arrhythmia diagnosis, in resource-constrained healthcare settings. Due to the lack of Romanian public medical data, we trained our systems using international public datasets, having in mind that the ECG signals are the same regardless the patients' nationality. Within this purpose, we combined multiple datasets, usually used in the field of arrhythmias classification: PTB-XL electrocardiography dataset , PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, China 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database, Georgia 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database, and St. Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database. For the input data, we employed ECG signal processing methods, specifically a variant of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, useful in arrhythmia classification because it provides a robust and efficient method for detecting QRS complexes in ECG signals. Additionally, we used machine learning techniques, widely used for the task of classification, including convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs, 2D CNNs, ResNet) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). The systems were evaluated in terms of accuracy and F1 score. We annalysed our dataset from two perspectives. First, we fed the systems with the ECG signals and the GRU-based 1D CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 93.4% among all the tested architectures. Secondly, we transformed ECG signals into images and the CNN2D model achieved an accuracy of 92.16%.</p></details> | 34 pages, 17 figures | None |
| **[VPNeXt -- Rethinking Dense Decoding for Plain Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16654v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VPNeXt, a new and simple model for the Plain Vision Transformer (ViT). Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous paradigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on ViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the existing paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask Decoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT really need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we investigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the effectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context Replay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the ViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real pyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier mock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality in the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation studies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We conducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that VPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective design. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the long-established mIoU wall/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report, minor fix</p></details> | None |
| **[CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17648v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> | None |
| **[Unraveling the geometry of visual relational reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17382v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans and other animals readily generalize abstract relations, such as recognizing constant in shape or color, whereas neural networks struggle. To investigate how neural networks generalize abstract relations, we introduce SimplifiedRPM, a novel benchmark for systematic evaluation. In parallel, we conduct human experiments to benchmark relational difficulty, enabling direct model-human comparisons. Testing four architectures--ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Wild Relation Network, and Scattering Compositional Learner (SCL)--we find that SCL best aligns with human behavior and generalizes best. Building on a geometric theory of neural representations, we show representational geometries that predict generalization. Layer-wise analysis reveals distinct relational reasoning strategies across models and suggests a trade-off where unseen rule representations compress into training-shaped subspaces. Guided by our geometric perspective, we propose and evaluate SNRloss, a novel objective balancing representation geometry. Our findings offer geometric insights into how neural networks generalize abstract relations, paving the way for more human-like visual reasoning in AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 7 figures, 8 SI figures, 2 SI tables</p></details> | None |

We propose an equivariant attention mechanism that operates on features extracted by steerable convolutions. Operating in Fourier space, our network utilizes Fourier space non-linearities. Our experiments in both two and three dimensions show that adding steerable transformer layers to steerable convolutional networks enhances performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fully Automatic Content-Aware Tiling Pipeline for Pathology Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16885v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the use of deep learning (DL) methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced computational pathology, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) Whole Slide Images (WSI) plays a crucial role by providing detailed tissue samples for the analysis and training of DL models. However, WSIs often contain regions with artifacts such as tissue folds, blurring, as well as non-tissue regions (background), which can negatively impact DL model performance. These artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant and can lead to inaccurate results. This paper proposes a fully automatic supervised DL pipeline for WSI Quality Assessment (WSI-QA) that uses a fused model combining CNNs and ViTs to detect and exclude WSI regions with artifacts, ensuring that only qualified WSI regions are used to build DL-based computational pathology applications. The proposed pipeline employs a pixel-based segmentation model to classify WSI regions as either qualified or non-qualified based on the presence of artifacts. The proposed model was trained on a large and diverse dataset and validated with internal and external data from various human organs, scanners, and H&E staining procedures. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in WSI artifact detection. The proposed model consistently achieved over 95% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across all artifact types. Furthermore, the WSI-QA pipeline shows strong generalization across different tissue types and scanning conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Medical Image Analysis journal, February 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[MaxGlaViT: A novel lightweight vision transformer-based approach for early diagnosis of glaucoma stages from fundus images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17154v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glaucoma is a prevalent eye disease that progresses silently without symptoms. If not detected and treated early, it can cause permanent vision loss. Computer-assisted diagnosis systems play a crucial role in timely and efficient identification. This study introduces MaxGlaViT, a lightweight model based on the restructured Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) for early glaucoma detection. First, MaxViT was scaled to optimize block and channel numbers, resulting in a lighter architecture. Second, the stem was enhanced by adding attention mechanisms (CBAM, ECA, SE) after convolution layers to improve feature learning. Third, MBConv structures in MaxViT blocks were replaced by advanced DL blocks (ConvNeXt, ConvNeXtV2, InceptionNeXt). The model was evaluated using the HDV1 dataset, containing fundus images of different glaucoma stages. Additionally, 40 CNN and 40 ViT models were tested on HDV1 to validate MaxGlaViT's efficiency. Among CNN models, EfficientB6 achieved the highest accuracy (84.91%), while among ViT models, MaxViT-Tiny performed best (86.42%). The scaled MaxViT reached 87.93% accuracy. Adding ECA to the stem block increased accuracy to 89.01%. Replacing MBConv with ConvNeXtV2 further improved it to 89.87%. Finally, integrating ECA in the stem and ConvNeXtV2 in MaxViT blocks resulted in 92.03% accuracy. Testing 80 DL models for glaucoma stage classification, this study presents a comprehensive and comparative analysis. MaxGlaViT outperforms experimental and state-of-the-art models, achieving 92.03% accuracy, 92.33% precision, 92.03% recall, 92.13% f1-score, and 87.12% Cohen's kappa score.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Image Matting in Real-World Scenes with Mask-Guided Iterative Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17093v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world image matting is essential for applications in content creation and augmented reality. However, it remains challenging due to the complex nature of scenes and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce Mask2Alpha, an iterative refinement framework designed to enhance semantic comprehension, instance awareness, and fine-detail recovery in image matting. Our framework leverages self-supervised Vision Transformer features as semantic priors, strengthening contextual understanding in complex scenarios. To further improve instance differentiation, we implement a mask-guided feature selection module, enabling precise targeting of objects in multi-instance settings. Additionally, a sparse convolution-based optimization scheme allows Mask2Alpha to recover high-resolution details through progressive refinement,from low-resolution semantic passes to high-resolution sparse reconstructions. Benchmarking across various real-world datasets, Mask2Alpha consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its effectiveness in accurate and efficient image matting.</p></details> | 9pages | None |
| **[Which Transformer to Favor: A Comparative Analysis of Efficiency in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09372v4)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-attention in Transformers comes with a high computational cost because of their quadratic computational complexity, but their effectiveness in addressing problems in language and vision has sparked extensive research aimed at enhancing their efficiency. However, diverse experimental conditions, spanning multiple input domains, prevent a fair comparison based solely on reported results, posing challenges for model selection. To address this gap in comparability, we perform a large-scale benchmark of more than 45 models for image classification, evaluating key efficiency aspects, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage. Our benchmark provides a standardized baseline for efficiency-oriented transformers. We analyze the results based on the Pareto front -- the boundary of optimal models. Surprisingly, despite claims of other models being more efficient, ViT remains Pareto optimal across multiple metrics. We observe that hybrid attention-CNN models exhibit remarkable inference memory- and parameter-efficiency. Moreover, our benchmark shows that using a larger model in general is more efficient than using higher resolution images. Thanks to our holistic evaluation, we provide a centralized resource for practitioners and researchers, facilitating informed decisions when selecting or developing efficient transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: n...</summary><p>v3: new models, analysis of scaling behaviors; v4: WACV 2025 camera ready version, appendix added</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we propose a global-local progressive integration model that addresses this challenge through three key contributions: 1) We develop a dual-measurement framework that combines vision Transformer (ViT)-based global feature extractor and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature extractor to comprehensively capture and quantify image distortion characteristics at different granularities. 2) We propose a progressive feature integration scheme that utilizes multi-scale kernel configurations to align global and local features, and progressively aggregates them via an interactive stack of channel-wise self-attention and spatial interaction modules for multi-grained quality-aware representations. 3) We introduce a semantic-aligned quality transfer method that extends the training data by automatically labeling the quality scores of diverse image content with subjective opinion scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our model yields 5.04% and 5.40% improvements in Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) for cross-authentic and cross-synthetic dataset generalization tests, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed semantic-aligned quality transfer further yields 2.26% and 13.23% performance gains in evaluations on single-synthetic and cross-synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[A Transformer-in-Transformer Network Utilizing Knowledge Distillation for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16762v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel knowledge distillation neural architecture leveraging efficient transformer networks for effective image classification. Natural images display intricate arrangements encompassing numerous extraneous elements. Vision transformers utilize localized patches to compute attention. However, exclusive dependence on patch segmentation proves inadequate in sufficiently encompassing the comprehensive nature of the image. To address this issue, we have proposed an inner-outer transformer-based architecture, which gives attention to the global and local aspects of the image. Moreover, The training of transformer models poses significant challenges due to their demanding resource, time, and data requirements. To tackle this, we integrate knowledge distillation into the architecture, enabling efficient learning. Leveraging insights from a larger teacher model, our approach enhances learning efficiency and effectiveness. Significantly, the transformer-in-transformer network acquires lightweight characteristics by means of distillation conducted within the feature extraction layer. Our featured network's robustness is established through substantial experimentation on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, demonstrating commendable top-1 and top-5 accuracy. The conducted ablative analysis comprehensively validates the effectiveness of the chosen parameters and settings, showcasing their superiority against contemporary methodologies. Remarkably, the proposed Transformer-in-Transformer Network (TITN) model achieves impressive performance milestones across various datasets: securing the highest top-1 accuracy of 74.71% and a top-5 accuracy of 92.28% for the CIFAR100 dataset, attaining an unparalleled top-1 accuracy of 92.03% and top-5 accuracy of 99.80% for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and registering an exceptional top-1 accuracy of 99.56% for the MNIST dataset.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learning Parameter Sharing with Tensor Decompositions and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09816v3)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large neural networks exhibit exceptional performance across numerous tasks, yet their considerable size often hinders deployment on resource-constrained systems. While various model compression strategies have been well studied, parameter sharing remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Fine-grained Parameter Sharing (FiPS), a novel algorithm that leverages parameter sharing, tensor decomposition, and sparsity to effectively compress large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). FiPS employs a shared base and sparse factors to represent neurons across multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, where initialization is guided by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and subsequent optimization is conducted through block-wise reconstruction error minimization. Experimental results show that FiPS reduces the parameter budget of MLP modules by 50-75% for DeiT-B and Swin-L and by 40-50% for various Gemma-2 and Llama-3 models while maintaining ViT model accuracy within 1% pt. of the original and LLM perplexity with negligible degradation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interpretable Retinal Disease Prediction Using Biology-Informed Heterogeneous Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16697v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretability is crucial to enhance trust in machine learning models for medical diagnostics. However, most state-of-the-art image classifiers based on neural networks are not interpretable. As a result, clinicians often resort to known biomarkers for diagnosis, although biomarker-based classification typically performs worse than large neural networks. This work proposes a method that surpasses the performance of established machine learning models while simultaneously improving prediction interpretability for diabetic retinopathy staging from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Our method is based on a novel biology-informed heterogeneous graph representation that models retinal vessel segments, intercapillary areas, and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in a human-interpretable way. This graph representation allows us to frame diabetic retinopathy staging as a graph-level classification task, which we solve using an efficient graph neural network. We benchmark our method against well-established baselines, including classical biomarker-based classifiers, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and vision transformers. Our model outperforms all baselines on two datasets. Crucially, we use our biology-informed graph to provide explanations of unprecedented detail. Our approach surpasses existing methods in precisely localizing and identifying critical vessels or intercapillary areas. In addition, we give informative and human-interpretable attributions to critical characteristics. Our work contributes to the development of clinical decision-support tools in ophthalmology.</p></details> |  | None |

Chest x-rays (CXRs) are used for diagnosis of COVID-19, but few studies predict the severity of a patient's condition from CXRs. In this study, we produce a large COVID severity dataset by merging three sources and investigate the efficacy of transfer learning using ImageNet- and CXR-pretrained models and vision transformers (ViTs) in both severity regression and classification tasks. A pretrained DenseNet161 model performed the best on the three class severity prediction problem, reaching 80% accuracy overall and 77.3%, 83.9%, and 70% on mild, moderate and severe cases, respectively. The ViT had the best regression results, with a mean absolute error of 0.5676 compared to radiologist-predicted severity scores.

In this work, we introduce Entropy-Lens, a scalable, model-agnostic framework that leverages information theory to interpret frozen, off-the-shelf large-scale transformers. By quantifying the evolution of Shannon entropy within intermediate residual streams, our approach extracts computational signatures that distinguish model families, categorize task-specific prompts, and correlate with output accuracy. We further demonstrate the generality of our method by extending the analysis to vision transformers. Our results suggest that entropy-based metrics can serve as a principled tool for unveiling the inner workings of modern transformer architectures.</p></details> |  | None |

However, our investigation reveals that most existing MLLMs are constrained by the absence of high-quality, large-scale, real-world datasets, resulting in inadequate performance in automated webpage code generation. To fill this gap, this paper introduces WebCode2M, a new dataset comprising 2.56 million instances, each containing a design image along with the corresponding webpage code and layout details. Sourced from real-world web resources, WebCode2M offers a rich and valuable dataset for webpage code generation across a variety of applications. The dataset quality is ensured by a scoring model that filters out instances with aesthetic deficiencies or other incomplete elements. To validate the effectiveness of WebCode2M, we introduce a baseline model based on the Vision Transformer (ViT), named WebCoder, and establish a benchmark for fair comparison. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, TreeBLEU, to measure the structural hierarchy recall. The benchmarking results demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the ability of MLLMs to generate code from webpage designs, confirming its effectiveness and usability for future applications in front-end design tools. Finally, we highlight several practical challenges introduced by our dataset, calling for further research.

| **[FeatSharp: Your Vision Model Features, Sharper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16025v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The feature maps of vision encoders are fundamental to myriad modern AI tasks, ranging from core perception algorithms (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection, depth perception, etc.) to modern multimodal understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). Currently, in computer vision, the frontier of general purpose vision backbones are Vision Transformers (ViT), typically trained using contrastive loss (e.g. CLIP). A key problem with most off-the-shelf ViTs, particularly CLIP, is that these models are inflexibly low resolution. Most run at 224x224px, while the "high resolution" versions are around 378-448px, but still inflexible. We introduce a novel method to coherently and cheaply upsample the feature maps of low-res vision encoders while picking up on fine-grained details that would otherwise be lost due to resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on core perception tasks as well as within agglomerative model (RADIO) training as a way of providing richer targets for distillation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Model Transferability of Adversarial Patches in Real-time Segmentation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16012v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models, particularly in safety-critical applications like healthcare and autonomous driving. Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in real-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following this idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic for autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a 'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this attack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized on a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a comprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches trained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S, PIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the Segformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of our analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study reveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs. Transformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude that although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images of any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular model are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true for both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that for CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike ViTs. Per-class analysis reveals that simple-classes like 'sky' suffer less misclassification than others.

While numerous forecasting-oriented foundation models have been introduced, there is a notable scarcity of models tailored for time series classification. To address this gap, we present Mantis, a new open-source foundation model for time series classification based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained using a contrastive learning approach. Our experimental results show that Mantis outperforms existing foundation models both when the backbone is frozen and when fine-tuned, while achieving the lowest calibration error.

| **[Vision Foundation Models in Medical Image Analysis: Advances and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14584v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), particularly Vision Transformers (ViT) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), has sparked significant advances in the field of medical image analysis. These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and achieving high generalization in segmentation tasks. However, adapting these large models to medical image analysis presents several challenges, including domain differences between medical and natural images, the need for efficient model adaptation strategies, and the limitations of small-scale medical datasets. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on the adaptation of VFMs to medical image segmentation, focusing on the challenges of domain adaptation, model compression, and federated learning. We discuss the latest developments in adapter-based improvements, knowledge distillation techniques, and multi-scale contextual feature modeling, and propose future directions to overcome these bottlenecks. Our analysis highlights the potential of VFMs, along with emerging methodologies such as federated learning and model compression, to revolutionize medical image analysis and enhance clinical applications. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of current approaches and suggest key areas for future research that can drive the next wave of innovation in medical image segmentation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 1 figure | None |

Our approach, Jumbo, creates a wider CLS token, which is split to match the patch token width before attention, processed with self-attention, and reassembled. After attention, Jumbo applies a dedicated, wider FFN to this token. Jumbo significantly improves over ViT+Registers on ImageNet-1K at high speeds (by 3.2% for ViT-tiny and 13.5% for ViT-nano); these Jumbo models even outperform specialized compute-efficient models while preserving the architectural advantages of plain ViTs. Although Jumbo sees no gains for ViT-small on ImageNet-1K, it gains 3.4% on ImageNet-21K over ViT+Registers. Both findings indicate that Jumbo is most helpful when the ViT is otherwise too narrow for the task. Finally, we show that Jumbo can be easily adapted to excel on data beyond images, e.g., time series.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns.

Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts.

However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible through: https://github.com/anthonyweidai/MobileViM_3D/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/anthonyweidai/MobileViM_3D) |

Built on a contrastive learning framework, Myna introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) on mel-spectrograms as the backbone and (2) a novel data augmentation strategy, token masking, that masks 90 percent of spectrogram tokens. These innovations deliver both effectiveness and efficiency: (i) Token masking enables a significant increase in per-GPU batch size, from 48 or 120 in prior methods (CLMR, MULE) to 4096. (ii) By avoiding traditional augmentations, Myna retains pitch sensitivity, enhancing performance in tasks like key detection. (iii) The use of vertical patches allows the model to better capture critical features for key detection. Our hybrid model, Myna-22M-Hybrid, processes both 16x16 and 128x2 patches, achieving state-of-the-art results. Trained on a single GPU, it outperforms MULE (62M) on average and rivals MERT-95M, which was trained on 16 and 64 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, it surpasses MERT-95M-public, establishing itself as the best-performing model trained on publicly available data.

This study explores deep learning techniques, specifically vision transformers (VTs) and large language models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of such attacks. We present substantial improvements over prior research, with the CoAtNet model achieving state-of-the-art performance.

We also evaluate transformer architectures and language models, with the best VT model matching CoAtNet's performance. A key advancement is the introduction of a noise mitigation method for real-world scenarios. By using LLMs for contextual understanding, we detect and correct erroneous keystrokes in noisy environments, enhancing ASCA performance. Additionally, fine-tuned lightweight language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) deliver comparable performance to heavyweight models with 67X more parameters.

The recent progress in open science leverages the accessibility to data. However, a majority of information is encoded within scientific documents limiting the capability of finding suitable literature as well as material properties. This manuscript showcases an automated workflow, which unravels the encoded information from scientific literature to a machine readable data structure of texts, figures, tables, equations and meta-data, using natural language processing and language as well as vision transformer models to generate a machine-readable database. The machine-readable database can be enriched with local data, as e.g. unpublished or private material data, leading to knowledge synthesis. The study shows that such an automated workflow accelerates information retrieval, proximate context detection and material property extraction from multi-modal input data exemplarily shown for the research field of microstructural analyses of face-centered cubic single crystals.

Accurate sleep staging and disorder detection are crucial for assessing sleep quality. Studies in the literature have proposed PSG-based approaches and machine-learning methods utilizing single-modality signals. However, existing methods often lack multimodal, multilabel frameworks and address sleep stages and disorders classification separately. In this paper, we propose a 1D-Vision Transformer for simultaneous classification of sleep stages and sleep disorders. Our method exploits the sleep disorders' correlation with specific sleep stage patterns and performs a simultaneous identification of a sleep stage and sleep disorder. The model is trained and tested using multimodal-multilabel sensory data (including photoplethysmogram, respiratory flow, and respiratory effort signals). The proposed method shows an overall accuracy (cohen's Kappa) of 78% (0.66) for five-stage sleep classification and 74% (0.58) for sleep apnea classification. Moreover, we analyzed the encoder attention weights to clarify our models' predictions and investigate the influence different features have on the models' outputs. The result shows that identified patterns, such as respiratory troughs and peaks, make a higher contribution to the final classification process.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Spiking Vision Transformer with Saccadic Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12677v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The combination of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) holds potential for achieving both energy efficiency and high performance, particularly suitable for edge vision applications. However, a significant performance gap still exists between SNN-based ViTs and their ANN counterparts. Here, we first analyze why SNN-based ViTs suffer from limited performance and identify a mismatch between the vanilla self-attention mechanism and spatio-temporal spike trains. This mismatch results in degraded spatial relevance and limited temporal interactions. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from biological saccadic attention mechanisms and introduce an innovative Saccadic Spike Self-Attention (SSSA) method. Specifically, in the spatial domain, SSSA employs a novel spike distribution-based method to effectively assess the relevance between Query and Key pairs in SNN-based ViTs. Temporally, SSSA employs a saccadic interaction module that dynamically focuses on selected visual areas at each timestep and significantly enhances whole scene understanding through temporal interactions. Building on the SSSA mechanism, we develop a SNN-based Vision Transformer (SNN-ViT). Extensive experiments across various visual tasks demonstrate that SNN-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear computational complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of the SNN-ViT highlight its potential for power-critical edge vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, due to the unique characteristics of image data, adapting SSMs from natural language processing to computer vision has not outperformed the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing vision SSMs primarily leverage manually designed scans to flatten image patches into sequences locally or globally. This approach disrupts the original semantic spatial adjacency of the image and lacks flexibility, making it difficult to capture complex image structures. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Scan (DAS), a data-driven method that adaptively allocates scanning orders and regions. This enables more flexible modeling capabilities while maintaining linear computational complexity and global modeling capacity. Based on DAS, we further propose the vision backbone DAMamba, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art vision Mamba models in vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, it surpasses some of the latest state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs.

This method processes the input image into a series of small patches. However, because of the strong correlation between different facial components in facial images. When it comes to super-resolution of low-resolution images, existing algorithms cannot handle the relationships between patches well, resulting in distorted facial components in the super-resolution results. To solve the problem, we propose a transformer architecture based on graph neural networks called graph vision transformer network. We treat each patch as a graph node and establish an adjacency matrix based on the information between patches. In this way, the patch only interacts between neighboring patches, further processing the relationship of facial components. Quantitative and visualization experiments have underscored the superiority of our algorithm over state-of-the-art techniques. Through detailed comparisons, we have demonstrated that our algorithm possesses more advanced super-resolution capabilities, particularly in enhancing facial components.

This paper presents a new algorithm, ViFOR, which combines Vision Transformers (ViT) and Implicit Neural Representation Networks (INRs) to generate High-Resolution (HR) images from Low-Resolution (LR) inputs. ViFOR introduces a novel integration of Fourier-based activation functions within the Vision Transformer architecture, enabling it to effectively capture global context and high-frequency details critical for accurate SR reconstruction.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of ImageNet-based pre-training on Vision Transformer (ViT) performance for OCT image classification across different dataset sizes. Our experiments cover four-category retinal pathologies (CNV, DME, Drusen, Normal). Results suggest that while pre-training can accelerate convergence and potentially offer better performance in smaller datasets, training from scratch may achieve comparable or even superior accuracy when sufficient OCT data is available. Our findings highlight the importance of matching domain characteristics in pre-training and call for further study on large-scale OCT-specific pre-training.</p></details> |  | None |

With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space.

However, as the depth of the model and the resolution of the input images increase, the computational cost associated with training and running ViT models has surged dramatically. This paper proposes a hybrid model based on CNN and Vision Transformer, named CI2P-ViT. The model incorporates a module called CI2P, which utilizes the CompressAI encoder to compress images and subsequently generates a sequence of patches through a series of convolutions. CI2P can replace the Patch Embedding component in the ViT model, enabling seamless integration into existing ViT models. Compared to ViT-B/16, CI2P-ViT has the number of patches input to the self-attention layer reduced to a quarter of the original. This design not only significantly reduces the computational cost of the ViT model but also effectively enhances the model's accuracy by introducing the inductive bias properties of CNN. The ViT model's precision is markedly enhanced. When trained from the ground up on the Animals-10 dataset, CI2P-ViT achieved an accuracy rate of 92.37%, representing a 3.3% improvement over the ViT-B/16 baseline. Additionally, the model's computational operations, measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPs), were diminished by 63.35%, and it exhibited a 2-fold increase in training velocity on identical hardware configurations.</p></details> | 15 pages,5 figures | None |

Given the high performance and reconfigurability, FPGA-based accelerators for MoE-ViT emerge, delivering substantial gains over general-purpose processors. However, existing accelerators often fall short of fully exploring the design space, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between resource utilization and performance. To overcome this problem, we introduce UbiMoE, a novel end-to-end FPGA accelerator tailored for MoE-ViT. Leveraging the unique computational and memory access patterns of MoE-ViTs, we develop a latency-optimized streaming attention kernel and a resource-efficient reusable linear kernel, effectively balancing performance and resource consumption. To further enhance design efficiency, we propose a two-stage heuristic search algorithm that optimally tunes hardware parameters for various FPGA resource constraints.

This trifecta of human thought has remained elusive in modern intelligent machines. In this work, we investigate whether slot representations extracted from visual scenes serve as appropriate compositional abstractions for grounding and reasoning. We present the Neural Slot Interpreter (NSI), which learns to ground object semantics in slots. At the core of NSI is an XML-like schema that uses simple syntax rules to organize the object semantics of a scene into object-centric schema primitives. Then, the NSI metric learns to ground primitives into slots through a structured contrastive learning objective that reasons over the intermodal alignment. Experiments with a bi-modal object-property and scene retrieval task demonstrate the grounding efficacy and interpretability of correspondences learned by NSI. From a scene representation standpoint, we find that emergent NSI slots that move beyond the image grid by binding to spatial objects facilitate improved visual grounding compared to conventional bounding-box-based approaches. From a data efficiency standpoint, we empirically validate that NSI learns more generalizable representations from a fixed amount of annotation data than the traditional approach. We also show that the grounded slots surpass unsupervised slots in real-world object discovery and scale with scene complexity. Finally, we investigate the reasoning abilities of the grounded slots. Vision Transformers trained on grounding-aware NSI tokenizers using as few as ten tokens outperform patch-based tokens on challenging few-shot classification tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

An under-explored question of PEFT is in extending the pre-training phase without supervised labels; that is, can we adapt a pre-trained foundation model to a new domain via efficient self-supervised pre-training on this new domain? In this work, we introduce ExPLoRA, a highly effective technique to improve transfer learning of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) under domain shifts. Initializing a ViT with pre-trained weights on large, natural-image datasets such as from DinoV2 or MAE, ExPLoRA continues the unsupervised pre-training objective on a new domain, unfreezing 1-2 pre-trained ViT blocks and tuning all other layers with LoRA. We then fine-tune the resulting model only with LoRA on this new domain for supervised learning. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on satellite imagery, even outperforming fully pre-training and fine-tuning ViTs. Using the DinoV2 training objective, we demonstrate up to 8% improvement in linear probing top-1 accuracy on downstream tasks while using <10% of the number of parameters that are used in prior fully-tuned state-of-the art approaches.

We employed transfer learning with MobileViTV2_050 using ImageNet-1k weights, a lightweight model that integrates CNN's local feature extraction with Vision Transformers' global context learning through a separable self-attention mechanism. Our approach resulted in a significant 15.66% improvement in classification accuracy for MobileViTV2_050-A, our first enhanced model trained on the baseline dataset, achieving 93.14%. Furthermore, MobileViTV2_050-B, our second enhanced model trained on a broader rice leaf dataset, demonstrated a 22.12% improvement, reaching 99.6% test accuracy. Additionally, MobileViTV2-A attained an F1-score of 93% across four rice labels and a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve ranging from 87% to 97%. In terms of resource consumption, our enhanced models reduced the total parameters of the baseline CNN model by up to 92.50%, from 14 million to 1.1 million. These results indicate that MobileViTV2_050 not only improves computational efficiency through its separable self-attention mechanism but also enhances global context learning. Consequently, it offers a lightweight and robust solution suitable for mobile deployment, advancing the interpretability and practicality of models in precision agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 46th World Conference on Applied Science, Engineering & Technology (WCASET) from Institute for Educational Research and Publication (IFERP)</p></details> | None |

Prevailing face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches generally concentrate on the single-frame scenario, however, purely photometric-driven methods overlook the dynamic spoofing clues that may be exposed over time. This may lead FAS systems to conclude incorrect judgments, especially in cases where it is easily distinguishable in terms of dynamics but challenging to discern in terms of photometrics. To this end, we propose the Graph Guided Video Vision Transformer (G$^2$V$^2$former), which combines faces with facial landmarks for photometric and dynamic feature fusion. We factorize the attention into space and time, and fuse them via a spatiotemporal block. Specifically, we design a novel temporal attention called Kronecker temporal attention, which has a wider receptive field, and is beneficial for capturing dynamic information. Moreover, we leverage the low-semantic motion of facial landmarks to guide the high-semantic change of facial expressions based on the motivation that regions containing landmarks may reveal more dynamic clues. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance under various scenarios. The codes will be released soon.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures | None |

Various architectures, from vision transformers (ViTs) to convolutional networks (ResNets) have been trained with CLIP to serve as general solutions to diverse vision tasks. This paper explores the differences across various CLIP-trained vision backbones. Despite using the same data and training objective, we find that these architectures have notably different representations, different classification performance across datasets, and different robustness properties to certain types of image perturbations. Our findings indicate a remarkable possible synergy across backbones by leveraging their respective strengths. In principle, classification accuracy could be improved by over 40 percentage with an informed selection of the optimal backbone per test example.Using this insight, we develop a straightforward yet powerful approach to adaptively ensemble multiple backbones. The approach uses as few as one labeled example per class to tune the adaptive combination of backbones. On a large collection of datasets, the method achieves a remarkable increase in accuracy of up to 39.1% over the best single backbone, well beyond traditional ensembles</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.14400</p></details> | None |

This paper surveys the integration of state-of-the-art ML and DL technologies, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and foundational models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), into surgical workflows. These technologies improve segmentation accuracy, instrument tracking, and phase recognition in surgical endoscopic video analysis. The paper explores the challenges these technologies face, such as data variability and computational demands, and discusses ethical considerations and integration hurdles in clinical settings. Highlighting the roles of FMs, we bridge the technological capabilities with clinical needs and outline future research directions to enhance the adaptability, efficiency, and ethical alignment of AI applications in surgery. Our findings suggest that substantial progress has been made; however, more focused efforts are required to achieve seamless integration of these technologies into clinical workflows, ensuring they complement surgical practice by enhancing precision, reducing risks, and optimizing patient outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a Recurrent Vision Transformer (Recurrent ViT) that integrates self-attention with recurrent memory, allowing both current inputs and stored information to guide attention allocation. Trained solely via sparse reward feedback on a spatially cued orientation change detection task, a paradigm used in primate studies, our model exhibits primate like signatures of attention, including improved accuracy and faster responses for cued stimuli that scale with cue validity. Analysis of self-attention maps reveals dynamic spatial prioritization with reactivation prior to expected changes, and targeted perturbations produce performance shifts similar to those observed in primate frontal eye fields and superior colliculus. These findings demonstrate that incorporating recurrent feedback into self attention can capture key aspects of primate visual attention.</p></details> |  | None |

This is usually performed by measuring the crown-rump-length (CRL) on an ultrasound image in the Dating scan which is then correlated with fetal age and growth trajectory. A major issue when performing the CRL measurement is ensuring that the image is acquired at the correct view, otherwise it could be misleading. Although clinical guidelines specify the criteria for the correct CRL view, sonographers may not regularly adhere to such rules. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based solution that is able to verify the adherence of a CRL image to clinical guidelines in order to assess image quality and facilitate accurate estimation of GA. We first segment out important fetal structures then use the localized structures to perform a clinically-guided mapping that verifies the adherence of criteria. The segmentation method combines the benefits of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Vision Transformer (ViT) to segment fetal structures in ultrasound images and localize important fetal landmarks. For segmentation purposes, we compare our proposed work with UNet and show that our CNN/ViT-based method outperforms an optimized version of UNet. Furthermore, we compare the output of the mapping with classification CNNs when assessing the clinical criteria and the overall acceptability of CRL images. We show that the proposed mapping is not only explainable but also more accurate than the best performing classification CNNs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures | None |

Addressing these challenges, this study presents a refined, comprehensive strategy leveraging advanced deep-learning techniques for the classification of leukemia subtypes. We commence by developing a hierarchical label taxonomy, paving the way for differentiating between various subtypes of leukemia. The research further introduces a novel hierarchical approach inspired by clinical procedures capable of accurately classifying diverse types of leukemia alongside reactive and healthy cells. An integral part of this study involves a meticulous examination of the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) as classifiers. The proposed method exhibits an impressive success rate, achieving approximately 90\% accuracy across all leukemia subtypes, as substantiated by our experimental results. A visual representation of the experimental findings is provided to enhance the model's explainability and aid in understanding the classification process.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures | None |

While existing methods treat parameters as vectors, they overlook the intrinsic structure of linear transformation matrices - the core components that comprise the majority of model parameters. These matrices are fundamental to neural networks, mapping input representations to output features through linear combinations. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we introduce task matrix and propose to Superpose Features from Task Matrix (SFTM), a novel approach that superposes features from individual task models into a merged model. SFTM employs singular value decomposition to identify feature bases of linear transformation matrices and solves a linear system to optimally combine them while preserving input-output mappings from individual task models. Extensive experiments on vision transformers and language models demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance and enhanced out-of-distribution generalization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures | None |

Here we introduce the Continuous Vision Transformer (CViT), a novel neural operator architecture that leverages advances in computer vision to address challenges in learning complex physical systems. CViT combines a vision transformer encoder, a novel grid-based coordinate embedding, and a query-wise cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. This design allows for flexible output representations and consistent evaluation at arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate CViT's effectiveness across a diverse range of partial differential equation (PDE) systems, including fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and reaction-diffusion processes. Our comprehensive experiments show that CViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, often surpassing larger foundation models, even without extensive pretraining and roll-out fine-tuning. Taken together, CViT exhibits robust handling of discontinuous solutions, multi-scale features, and intricate spatio-temporal dynamics. Our contributions can be viewed as a significant step towards adapting advanced computer vision architectures for building more flexible and accurate machine learning models in the physical sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 tables, 19figures</p></details> | None |

Weakly-supervised learning, which allows less precise labels, has become a promising solution to this challenge. Building on this approach, we propose QMaxViT-Unet+, a novel framework for scribble-supervised medical image segmentation. This framework is built on the U-Net architecture, with the encoder and decoder replaced by Multi-Axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT) blocks. These blocks enhance the model's ability to learn local and global features efficiently. Additionally, our approach integrates a query-based Transformer decoder to refine features and an edge enhancement module to compensate for the limited boundary information in the scribble label. We evaluate the proposed QMaxViT-Unet+ on four public datasets focused on cardiac structures, colorectal polyps, and breast cancer: ACDC, MS-CMRSeg, SUN-SEG, and BUSI. Evaluation metrics include the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95). Experimental results show that QMaxViT-Unet+ achieves 89.1\% DSC and 1.316mm HD95 on ACDC, 88.4\% DSC and 2.226mm HD95 on MS-CMRSeg, 71.4\% DSC and 4.996mm HD95 on SUN-SEG, and 69.4\% DSC and 50.122mm HD95 on BUSI. These results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency while remaining competitive with fully-supervised learning approaches. This makes it ideal for medical image analysis, where high-quality annotations are often scarce and require significant effort and expense.

Since ViTs are computationally expensive, the models either have to be pruned to run on resource-limited edge devices only or have to be executed on remote cloud servers after receiving the raw data transmitted over fluctuating networks. The resulting degraded performance or high latency all hinder their widespread applications. In this paper, we present Janus, the first framework for low-latency cloud-device collaborative Vision Transformer inference over dynamic networks. Janus overcomes the intrinsic model limitations of ViTs and realizes collaboratively executing ViT models on both cloud and edge devices, achieving low latency, high accuracy, and low communication overhead. Specifically, Janus judiciously combines token pruning techniques with a carefully designed fine-to-coarse model splitting policy and non-static mixed pruning policy. It attains a balance between accuracy and latency by dynamically selecting the optimal pruning level and split point. Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate that Janus enhances throughput by up to 5.15 times and reduces latency violation ratios by up to 98.7% when compared with baseline approaches under various network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE INFOCOM 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[One Leaf Reveals the Season: Occlusion-Based Contrastive Learning with Semantic-Aware Views for Efficient Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09858v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a scalable and straightforward pre-training paradigm for efficient visual conceptual representation called occluded image contrastive learning (OCL). Our OCL approach is simple: we randomly mask patches to generate different views within an image and contrast them among a mini-batch of images. The core idea behind OCL consists of two designs. First, masked tokens have the potential to significantly diminish the conceptual redundancy inherent in images, and create distinct views with substantial fine-grained differences on the semantic concept level instead of the instance level. Second, contrastive learning is adept at extracting high-level semantic conceptual features during the pre-training, circumventing the high-frequency interference and additional costs associated with image reconstruction. Importantly, OCL learns highly semantic conceptual representations efficiently without relying on hand-crafted data augmentations or additional auxiliary modules. Empirically, OCL demonstrates high scalability with Vision Transformers, as the ViT-L/16 can complete pre-training in 133 hours using only 4 A100 GPUs, achieving 85.8\% accuracy in downstream fine-tuning tasks.

MedMimic is introduced as a multimodal framework inspired by real-world diagnostic processes. It uses pretrained models such as DINOv2, Vision Transformer, and ResNet-18 to convert high-dimensional 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging into low-dimensional, semantically meaningful features. A learnable self-attention-based fusion network then integrates these imaging features with clinical data for classification. Using 416 FUO patient cases from Sichuan University West China Hospital from 2017 to 2023, the multimodal fusion classification network MFCN achieved macro-AUROC scores ranging from 0.8654 to 0.9291 across seven tasks, outperforming conventional machine learning and single-modality deep learning methods. Ablation studies and five-fold cross-validation further validated its effectiveness. By combining the strengths of pretrained large models and deep learning, MedMimic offers a promising solution for disease classification.</p></details> |  | None |

These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT.

This phenomenon is prevalent across various machine learning applications, including vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where models may find unintended cues that minimize training loss but fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Vision classifiers such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are positionally correlated with class labels, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features. We perform both quantitative evaluation by training on the shortcut-modified dataset and testing them on two different test sets -- one containing the same shortcuts and another without them -- to determine the extent of reliance on shortcuts. Additionally, qualitative evaluation is performed by using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques to analyze what the models internalize in their weights, aiming to reconstruct the training data as perceived by the classifiers. We evaluate shortcut learning behavior across multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10, to compare the susceptibility of different vision classifier architectures to shortcut reliance and assess their varying degrees of sensitivity to spurious correlations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, T2V generation still faces two important challenges: 1) Lacking a precise open sourced high-quality dataset. The previous popular video datasets, e.g. WebVid-10M and Panda-70M, are either with low quality or too large for most research institutions. Therefore, it is challenging but crucial to collect a precise high-quality text-video pairs for T2V generation. 2) Ignoring to fully utilize textual information. Recent T2V methods have focused on vision transformers, using a simple cross attention module for video generation, which falls short of thoroughly extracting semantic information from text prompt. To address these issues, we introduce OpenVid-1M, a precise high-quality dataset with expressive captions. This open-scenario dataset contains over 1 million text-video pairs, facilitating research on T2V generation. Furthermore, we curate 433K 1080p videos from OpenVid-1M to create OpenVidHD-0.4M, advancing high-definition video generation. Additionally, we propose a novel Multi-modal Video Diffusion Transformer (MVDiT) capable of mining both structure information from visual tokens and semantic information from text tokens. Extensive experiments and ablation studies verify the superiority of OpenVid-1M over previous datasets and the effectiveness of our MVDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures, Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

Image denoising is a noisy image reconstruction process that aims to reduce additional noise that occurs from the noisy image with various strategies. Image denoising has a problem, namely that some image denoising methods require some prior knowledge of information about noise. To overcome this problem, a combined architecture of Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) and Residual Networks (ResNet) is used which is called the Residual Transformer Fusion Network (RTF-Net). In general, the process in this architecture can be divided into two parts, Noise Suppression Network (NSN) and Structure Enhancement Network (SEN). Residual Block is used in the Noise Suppression Network and is used to learn the noise map in the image, while the CvT is used in the Structure Enhancement Network and is used to learn the details that need to be added to the image processed by the Noise Suppression Network. The model was trained using the DIV2K Training Set dataset, and validation using the DIV2K Validation Set. After doing the training, the model was tested using Lena, Bridge, Pepper, and BSD300 images with noise levels ranging from 30%, 50%, and 70% and the PSNR results were compared with the DBA, NASNLM, PARIGI, NLSF, NLSF-MLP and NLSF-CNN methods. The test results show that the proposed method is superior in all cases except for Pepper's image with a noise level of 30%, where NLSF-CNN is superior with a PSNR value of 32.99 dB, while the proposed method gets a PSNR value of 31.70 dB.</p></details> | 8 pages, 17 figures | None |

Vision Transformers have mainly been limited to attention extraction to provide insight into the model's reasoning. Our approach combines the high performance of Vision Transformers with the introduction of new explainability capabilities. We present HierViT, a Vision Transformer that is inherently interpretable and adapts its reasoning to that of humans. A hierarchical structure is used to process domain-specific features for prediction. It is interpretable by design, as it derives the target output with human-defined features that are visualized by exemplary images (prototypes). By incorporating domain knowledge about these decisive features, the reasoning is semantically similar to human reasoning and therefore intuitive. Moreover, attention heatmaps visualize the crucial regions for identifying each feature, thereby providing HierViT with a versatile tool for validating predictions. Evaluated on two medical benchmark datasets, LIDC-IDRI for lung nodule assessment and derm7pt for skin lesion classification, HierViT achieves superior and comparable prediction accuracy, respectively, while offering explanations that align with human reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the method of choice in vision applications and have shown excellent potential in automatic classification of US images. Despite their success, their restricted local receptive field limits their ability to learn global context information. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) designs that are based on self-attention between image patches have shown great potential to be an alternative to CNNs. In this study, for the first time, we utilize ViT to classify breast US images using different augmentation strategies. The results are provided as classification accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics, and the performance is compared with the state-of-the-art CNNs.

Transformers originated from machine translation and are particularly good at modelling long-range dependencies within a long sequence. Although the global interaction between the token embeddings could be well modelled by the self-attention mechanism of transformers, what is lacking is a locality mechanism for information exchange within a local region. In this paper, locality mechanism is systematically investigated by carefully designed controlled experiments. We add locality to vision transformers into the feed-forward network. This seemingly simple solution is inspired by the comparison between feed-forward networks and inverted residual blocks. The importance of locality mechanisms is validated in two ways: 1) A wide range of design choices (activation function, layer placement, expansion ratio) are available for incorporating locality mechanisms and proper choices can lead to a performance gain over the baseline, and 2) The same locality mechanism is successfully applied to vision transformers with different architecture designs, which shows the generalization of the locality concept. For ImageNet2012 classification, the locality-enhanced transformers outperform the baselines Swin-T, DeiT-T, and PVT-T by 1.0%, 2.6% and 3.1% with a negligible increase in the number of parameters and computational effort.

Pre-training Vision Transformer (ViT) through masked image modeling (MIM) on large-scale unlabeled medical datasets presents a promising solution, providing both computational efficiency and model generalization for various downstream tasks. However, current ViT-based MIM pre-training frameworks predominantly emphasize local aggregation representations in output layers and fail to exploit the rich representations across different ViT layers that better capture fine-grained semantic information needed for more precise medical downstream tasks. To fill the above gap, we hereby present Hierarchical Encoder-driven MAE (Hi-End-MAE), a simple yet effective ViT-based pre-training solution, which centers on two key innovations: (1) Encoder-driven reconstruction, which encourages the encoder to learn more informative features to guide the reconstruction of masked patches; and (2) Hierarchical dense decoding, which implements a hierarchical decoding structure to capture rich representations across different layers. We pre-train Hi-End-MAE on a large-scale dataset of 10K CT scans and evaluated its performance across seven public medical image segmentation benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-End-MAE achieves superior transfer learning capabilities across various downstream tasks, revealing the potential of ViT in medical imaging applications.

However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents a critical challenge for deployment in robust applications. This paper addresses the critical question of how to incorporate robustness into MoEs while maintaining high natural accuracy. We begin by analyzing the vulnerability of MoE components, finding that expert networks are notably more susceptible to adversarial attacks than the router. Based on this insight, we propose a targeted robust training technique that integrates a novel loss function to enhance the adversarial robustness of MoE, requiring only the robustification of one additional expert without compromising training or inference efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a dual-model strategy that linearly combines a standard MoE model with our robustified MoE model using a smoothing parameter. This approach allows for flexible control over the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We further provide theoretical foundations by deriving certified robustness bounds for both the single MoE and the dual-model. To push the boundaries of robustness and accuracy, we propose a novel joint training strategy JTDMoE for the dual-model.

These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

The ESMs are highly complex, and thus, deep neural network architectures are used to model the complexity and store the down-sampled data. In this paper, we propose the Vision Transformer Sinusoidal Representation Networks (ViSIR) to improve the single image SR (SR) reconstruction task for the ESM data. Methods: ViSIR combines the SR capability of Vision Transformers (ViT) with the high-frequency detail preservation of the Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to address the spectral bias observed in SR tasks. Results: The ViSIR outperforms ViT by 4.1 dB, SIREN by 7.5 dB, and SR-Generative Adversarial (SR-GANs) by 7.1dB PSNR on average for three different measurements. Conclusion: The proposed ViSIR is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm is outperforming other methods in terms of Mean Square Error(MSE), Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio(PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure(SSIM).</p></details> |  | None |

A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade plasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma scenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental machines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically is extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge, making it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies. In this work, we propose a method for training neural surrogates for 5D gyrokinetic simulations. Our method extends a hierarchical vision transformer to five dimensions and is trained on the 5D distribution function for the adiabatic electron approximation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately infer downstream physical quantities such as heat flux time trace and electrostatic potentials for single-step predictions two orders of magnitude faster than numerical codes. Our work paves the way towards neural surrogates for plasma turbulence simulations to accelerate deployment of commercial energy production via nuclear fusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (+ references and appendix)</p></details> | None |

The driving scene perception system fundamentally represents an object detection task that requires achieving a balance between accuracy and processing speed. Many contemporary methods focus on improving detection accuracy but often overlook the importance of real-time detection capabilities when computational resources are limited. Thus, it is vital to investigate efficient object detection strategies for driving scenes. This paper introduces Fast-COS, a novel single-stage object detection framework crafted specifically for driving scene applications. The research initiates with an analysis of the backbone, considering both macro and micro architectural designs, yielding the Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer (RAViT). RAViT utilizes Reparameterized Multi-Scale Depth-Wise Convolution (RepMSDW) and Reparameterized Self-Attention (RepSA) to enhance computational efficiency and feature extraction. In extensive tests across GPU, edge, and mobile platforms, RAViT achieves 81.4% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset, demonstrating significant throughput improvements over comparable backbone models such as ResNet, FastViT, RepViT, and EfficientFormer. Additionally, integrating RepMSDW into a feature pyramid network forms RepFPN, enabling fast and multi-scale feature fusion. Fast-COS enhances object detection in driving scenes, attaining an AP50 score of 57.2% on the BDD100K dataset and 80.0% on the TJU-DHD Traffic dataset. It surpasses leading models in efficiency, delivering up to 75.9% faster GPU inference and 1.38 higher throughput on edge devices compared to FCOS, YOLOF, and RetinaNet. These findings establish Fast-COS as a highly scalable and reliable solution suitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-limited environments like autonomous driving systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review on IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> | None |

However, unlike close-up shots in the MS COCO dataset, the higher resolution and wider field of view raise unique challenges, such as extreme sparsity and huge scale changes, causing existing close-up detectors inaccuracy and inefficiency. In this paper, we present a novel model-agnostic sparse vision transformer, dubbed SparseFormer, to bridge the gap of object detection between close-up and HRW shots. The proposed SparseFormer selectively uses attentive tokens to scrutinize the sparsely distributed windows that may contain objects. In this way, it can jointly explore global and local attention by fusing coarse- and fine-grained features to handle huge scale changes. SparseFormer also benefits from a novel Cross-slice non-maximum suppression (C-NMS) algorithm to precisely localize objects from noisy windows and a simple yet effective multi-scale strategy to improve accuracy. Extensive experiments on two HRW benchmarks, PANDA and DOTA-v1.0, demonstrate that the proposed SparseFormer significantly improves detection accuracy (up to 5.8%) and speed (up to 3x) over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ACM MM 2024</p></details> | None |

However, internal defects such as porosity and cracks can compromise mechanical properties and overall performance. This study focuses on in-situ monitoring and characterization of melt pools associated with porosity, aiming to improve defect detection and quality control in DED-printed parts. Traditional machine learning approaches for defect identification rely on extensive labeled datasets, often scarce and expensive to generate in real-world manufacturing. To address this, our framework employs self-supervised learning on unlabeled melt pool data using a Vision Transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to produce highly representative embeddings. These fine-tuned embeddings are leveraged via transfer learning to train classifiers on a limited labeled dataset, enabling the effective identification of melt pool anomalies. We evaluate two classifiers: (1) a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier utilizing the fine-tuned MAE Encoder's parameters and (2) the fine-tuned MAE Encoder combined with an MLP classifier head. Our framework achieves overall accuracy ranging from 95.44% to 99.17% and an average F1 score exceeding 80%, with the ViT Classifier slightly outperforming the MAE Encoder Classifier. This demonstrates the scalability and cost-effectiveness of our approach for automated quality control in DED, effectively detecting defects with minimal labeled data.</p></details> |  | None |

For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths. Integration of YOLO11 and Depth Anything Model provides a promising solution to 3D pose estimation of immature green fruits for robotic thinning applications.

Unlike short-term re-identification systems that rely on temporary features (e.g., clothing), we focus on learning persistent body shape characteristics that remain stable over time. We introduce a body identification model based on a Vision Transformer (ViT) (Body Identification from Diverse Datasets, BIDDS) and on a Swin-ViT model (Swin-BIDDS). We also expand on previous approaches based on the Linguistic and Non-linguistic Core ResNet Identity Models (LCRIM and NLCRIM), but with improved training. All models are trained on a large and diverse dataset of over 1.9 million images of approximately 5k identities across 9 databases. Performance was evaluated on standard re-identification benchmark datasets (MARS, MSMT17, Outdoor Gait, DeepChange) and on an unconstrained dataset that includes images at a distance (from close-range to 1000m), at altitude (from an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV), and with clothing change. A comparative analysis across these models provides insights into how different backbone architectures and input image sizes impact long-term body identification performance across real-world conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Demystifying Singular Defects in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07004v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large transformer models are known to produce high-norm tokens. In vision transformers (ViTs), such tokens have been mathematically modeled through the singular vectors of the linear approximations of layers. However, in large language models (LLMs), the underlying causes of high-norm tokens remain largely unexplored, and their different properties from those of ViTs require a new analysis framework. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical validation across a range of recent models, leading to the following observations: i) The layer-wise singular direction predicts the abrupt explosion of token norms in LLMs. ii) The negative eigenvalues of a layer explain its sudden decay. iii) The computational pathways leading to high-norm tokens differ between initial and noninitial tokens. iv) High-norm tokens are triggered by the right leading singular vector of the matrix approximating the corresponding modules. We showcase two practical applications of these findings: the improvement of quantization schemes and the design of LLM signatures. Our findings not only advance the understanding of singular defects in LLMs but also open new avenues for their application. We expect that this work will stimulate further research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and will therefore publicly release our code.</p></details> |  | None |

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides the highest expressivity in ischemic stroke but poses substantial challenges for automated lesion segmentation: susceptibility artefacts, morphological heterogeneity, age-related comorbidities, time-dependent signal dynamics, instrumental variability, and limited labelled data. Current U-Net-based models therefore underperform, a problem accentuated by inadequate evaluation metrics that focus on mean performance, neglecting anatomical, subpopulation, and acquisition-dependent variability. Here, we present a high-performance DWI lesion segmentation tool addressing these challenges through optimized vision transformer-based architectures, integration of 3563 annotated lesions from multi-site data, and algorithmic enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art results. We further propose a novel evaluative framework assessing model fidelity, equity (across demographics and lesion subtypes), anatomical precision, and robustness to instrumental variability, promoting clinical and research utility. This work advances stroke imaging by reconciling model expressivity with domain-specific challenges and redefining performance benchmarks to prioritize equity and generalizability, critical for personalized medicine and mechanistic research.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, 1 supplementary table, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> | None |

As models are continually scaled up to improve performance, a rigorous understanding of SAM's scaling behaviour is paramount. To this end, we study the infinite-width limit of neural networks trained with SAM, using the Tensor Programs framework. Our findings reveal that the dynamics of standard SAM effectively reduce to applying SAM solely in the last layer in wide neural networks, even with optimal hyperparameters. In contrast, we identify a stable parameterization with layerwise perturbation scaling, which we call $\textit{Maximal Update and Perturbation Parameterization}$ ($\mu$P$^2$), that ensures all layers are both feature learning and effectively perturbed in the limit. Through experiments with MLPs, ResNets and Vision Transformers, we empirically demonstrate that $\mu$P$^2$ achieves hyperparameter transfer of the joint optimum of learning rate and perturbation radius across model scales. Moreover, we provide an intuitive condition to derive $\mu$P$^2$ for other perturbation rules like Adaptive SAM and SAM-ON, also ensuring balanced perturbation effects across all layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final NeurIPS 2024 camera-ready version.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue by updating only a small subset of model parameters using adapter modules. In this work, we propose \emph{Quantum-Inspired Adapters}, a PEFT approach inspired by Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits from quantum machine learning literature. These models can be both expressive and parameter-efficient by operating in a combinatorially large space while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in weight parameters. We test our proposed adapters by adapting large language models and large vision transformers on benchmark datasets. Our method can achieve 99.2\% of the performance of existing fine-tuning methods such LoRA with a 44x parameter compression on language understanding datasets like GLUE and VTAB. Compared to existing orthogonal fine-tuning methods such as OFT or BOFT, we achieve 98\% relative performance with 25x fewer parameters. This demonstrates competitive performance paired with a significant reduction in trainable parameters. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that Quantum-Inspired Adapters offer a promising direction for efficient adaptation of language and vision models in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Despite their success in tasks focused solely on RGB images, the potential of VFMs in RGB-depth driving scene parsing remains largely under-explored. In this article, we take one step toward this emerging research area by investigating a feasible technique to fully exploit VFMs for generalizable RGB-depth driving scene parsing. Specifically, we explore the inherent characteristics of RGB and depth data, thereby presenting a Heterogeneous Feature Integration Transformer (HFIT). This network enables the efficient extraction and integration of comprehensive heterogeneous features without re-training ViTs. Relative depth prediction results from VFMs, used as inputs to the HFIT side adapter, overcome the limitations of the dependence on depth maps. Our proposed HFIT demonstrates superior performance compared to all other traditional single-modal and data-fusion scene parsing networks, pre-trained VFMs, and ViT adapters on the Cityscapes and KITTI Semantics datasets. We believe this novel strategy paves the way for future innovations in VFM-based data-fusion techniques for driving scene parsing.

Yet, efficiently adapting them for multiple tasks remains a challenge that arises from the need to modify the rich hidden representations encoded by the learned weight matrices, without inducing interference between tasks. Current parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, which apply low-rank updates, force tasks to compete within constrained subspaces, ultimately degrading performance. We introduce DiTASK a novel Diffeomorphic Multi-Task Fine-Tuning approach that maintains pre-trained representations by preserving weight matrix singular vectors, while enabling task-specific adaptations through neural diffeomorphic transformations of the singular values. By following this approach, DiTASK enables both shared and task-specific feature modulations with minimal added parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that DITASK achieves full-rank updates during optimization, preserving the geometric structure of pre-trained features, and establishing a new paradigm for efficient multi-task learning (MTL).

However, many hydrologic models are computationally expensive and, depending on the resolution and scale, simulations can take on the order of hours to days to complete. While techniques such as uncertainty quantification and optimization have become valuable tools for supporting management decisions, these analyses typically require hundreds of model simulations, which are too computationally expensive to perform with a process-based hydrologic model. To address this gap, we assess a hybrid modeling workflow in which a process-based model is used to generate an initial set of simulations and a machine learning (ML) surrogate model is then trained to perform the remaining simulations required for downstream analysis. As a case study, we apply this workflow to simulations of variably saturated groundwater flow at a prospective managed aquifer recharge site. We compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of several ML architectures, including deep convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, vision transformers, and networks with Fourier transforms. Our results demonstrate that ML surrogate models can achieve under 10% mean absolute percentage error and yield order-of-magnitude runtime savings over process-based models. Building on these findings, we examine the impacts of key modeling choices on surrogate model accuracy and efficiency. Results show that a normalized loss function improves training stability, while min-max data normalization can significantly reduce error up to a factor of 10 when compared to other treatments such as Z-score and no normalization.

| **[Beyond 2:4: exploring V:N:M sparsity for efficient transformer inference on GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16135v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To date, 2:4 sparsity has stood as the only sparse pattern that can be accelerated using sparse tensor cores on GPUs. In practice, 2:4 sparsity often possesses low actual speedups ($\leq 1.3$) and requires fixed sparse ratios, meaning that other ratios, such as 4:8, 8:16, or those exceeding 50% sparsity, do not incur any speedups on GPUs. Recent studies suggest that V:N:M sparsity is promising in addressing these limitations of 2:4 sparsity. However, regarding accuracy, the effects of V:N:M sparsity on broader Transformer models, such as vision Transformers and large language models (LLMs), are largely unexamined. Moreover, Some specific issues related to V:N:M sparsity, such as how to select appropriate V and M values, remain unresolved. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the application of V:N:M sparsity in vision models and LLMs across multiple tasks, from pertaining to downstream tasks. We propose three key approaches to enhance the applicability and accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers, including heuristic V and M selection, V:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training techniques. Experimental results show that, with our methods, the DeiT-small achieves lossless accuracy at 64:2:5 sparsity, while the DeiT-base maintains accuracy even at 64:2:8 sparsity. In addition, the fine-tuned LLama2-7B at 64:2:5 sparsity performs comparably or better than training-free 2:4 sparse alternatives on downstream tasks. More importantly, V:N:M-sparse Transformers offer a wider range of speedup-accuracy trade-offs compared to 2:4 sparsity. Overall, our exploration largely facilitates the V:N:M sparsity to act as a truly effective acceleration solution for Transformers in cost-sensitive inference scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, we attempt to address the following questions in a mathematically principled way: i) Where to add a new capacity (layer) during the training process? ii) How to initialize the new capacity? At the heart of our approach are two key ingredients: i) the introduction of a ``shape functional" to be minimized, which depends on neural network topology, and ii) the introduction of a topological derivative of the shape functional with respect to the neural network topology. Using an optimal control viewpoint, we show that the network topological derivative exists under certain conditions, and its closed-form expression is derived. In particular, we explore, for the first time, the connection between the topological derivative from a topology optimization framework with the Hamiltonian from optimal control theory. Further, we show that the optimality condition for the shape functional leads to an eigenvalue problem for deep neural architecture adaptation. Our approach thus determines the most sensitive location along the depth where a new layer needs to be inserted during the training phase and the associated parametric initialization for the newly added layer. We also demonstrate that our layer insertion strategy can be derived from an optimal transport viewpoint as a solution to maximizing a topological derivative in $p$-Wasserstein space, where $p>= 1$. Numerical investigations with fully connected network, convolutional neural network, and vision transformer on various regression and classification problems demonstrate that our proposed approach can outperform an ad-hoc baseline network and other architecture adaptation strategies. Further, we also demonstrate other applications of topological derivative in fields such as transfer learning.</p></details> |  | None |

This work evaluates the performance of Vision Transformers architectures, including Swin Transformer and MaxViT, in several datasets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. We used three training sets of images with brain, lung, and kidney tumors. Each dataset includes different classification labels, from brain gliomas and meningiomas to benign and malignant lung conditions and kidney anomalies such as cysts and cancers. This work aims to analyze the behavior of the neural networks in each dataset and the benefits of combining different image modalities and tumor classes. We designed several experiments by fine-tuning the models on combined and individual image modalities. The results revealed that the Swin Transformer provided high accuracy, achieving up to 99.9\% for kidney tumor classification and 99.3\% accuracy in a combined dataset. MaxViT also provided excellent results in individual datasets but performed poorly when data is combined. This research highlights the adaptability of Transformer-based models to various image modalities and features. However, challenges persist, including limited annotated data and interpretability issues. Future works will expand this study by incorporating other image modalities and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. Integrating these models across diverse datasets could mark a pivotal advance in precision medicine, paving the way for more efficient and comprehensive healthcare solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

However, existing works on BaB for NN verification have mostly focused on NNs with piecewise linear activations, especially ReLU networks. In this paper, we develop a general framework, named GenBaB, to conduct BaB on general nonlinearities to verify NNs with general architectures, based on linear bound propagation for NN verification. To decide which neuron to branch, we design a new branching heuristic which leverages linear bounds as shortcuts to efficiently estimate the potential improvement after branching. To decide nontrivial branching points for general nonlinear functions, we propose to pre-optimize branching points, which can be efficiently leveraged during verification with a lookup table. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our GenBaB on verifying a wide range of NNs, including NNs with activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, Sine and GeLU, as well as NNs involving multi-dimensional nonlinear operations such as multiplications in LSTMs and Vision Transformers. Our framework also allows the verification of general nonlinear computation graphs and enables verification applications beyond simple NNs, particularly for AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). GenBaB is part of the latest $\alpha$,$\beta$-CROWN, the winner of the 4th and the 5th International Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP 2023 and 2024).

Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures, in particular, have demonstrated strong feature extraction capabilities when pre-trained on large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce the Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer (MR-IPT), a ViT-based framework designed to enhance the generalizability and robustness of accelerated MRI reconstruction. Unlike conventional deep learning models that require separate training for different acceleration factors, MR-IPT is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset encompassing multiple undersampling patterns and acceleration settings, enabling a unified reconstruction framework. By leveraging a shared transformer backbone, MR-IPT effectively learns universal feature representations, allowing it to generalize across diverse reconstruction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR-IPT outperforms both CNN-based and existing transformer-based methods, achieving superior reconstruction quality across varying acceleration factors and sampling masks. Moreover, MR-IPT exhibits strong robustness, maintaining high performance even under unseen acquisition setups, highlighting its potential as a scalable and efficient solution for accelerated MRI. Our findings suggest that transformer-based general models can significantly advance MRI reconstruction, offering improved adaptability and stability compared to traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Many existing defenses against these attacks, such as adversarial training, rely on full-model fine-tuning to induce robustness in the models. These defenses require storing a copy of the entire model, that can have billions of parameters, for each task. At the same time, parameter-efficient prompt tuning is used to adapt large transformer-based models to downstream tasks without the need to save large copies. In this paper, we examine parameter-efficient prompt tuning of Vision Transformers for downstream tasks under the lens of robustness. We show that previous adversarial defense methods, when applied to the prompt tuning paradigm, suffer from gradient obfuscation and are vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We introduce ADAPT, a novel framework for performing adaptive adversarial training in the prompt tuning paradigm. Our method achieves competitive robust accuracy of ~40% w.r.t.

However, extending VLMs to 3D medical imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to self-attention's quadratic complexity, or 3D convolutions, which demand excessive parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D medical image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along depth, height, and width. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports, for zero-shot multi-abnormality detection across 18 pathologies. Compared to ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet, DCFormer achieves superior efficiency and accuracy, with DCFormer-Tiny reaching 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score while using significantly fewer parameters. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

This study focuses on fine-tuning the Vision Transformer (ViT) model specifically for HAR using radar-based Time-Doppler signatures. Unlike traditional image datasets, these signals present unique challenges due to their non-visual nature and the high degree of similarity among various activities. Directly fine-tuning the ViT with all parameters proves suboptimal for this application. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning in the weight space to facilitate knowledge transfer from pre-trained ViT models. Additionally, to extract fine-grained features, we enhance feature representation through the integration of a serial-parallel adapter in the feature space. Our innovative joint fine-tuning method, tailored for radar-based Time-Doppler signatures, significantly improves HAR accuracy, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methodologies in this domain.

In this paper, we study the sources of known representation vulnerabilities of vision transformers (ViT), where perceptually identical images can have very different representations and semantically unrelated images can have the same representation. Our analysis indicates that imperceptible changes to the input can result in significant representation changes, particularly in later layers, suggesting potential instabilities in the performance of ViTs. Our comprehensive study reveals that adversarial effects, while subtle in early layers, propagate and amplify through the network, becoming most pronounced in middle to late layers. This insight motivates the development of NeuroShield-ViT, a novel defense mechanism that strategically neutralizes vulnerable neurons in earlier layers to prevent the cascade of adversarial effects. We demonstrate NeuroShield-ViT's effectiveness across various attacks, particularly excelling against strong iterative attacks, and showcase its remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. Without fine-tuning, our method achieves a competitive accuracy of 77.8% on adversarial examples, surpassing conventional robustness methods. Our results shed new light on how adversarial effects propagate through ViT layers, while providing a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks. Additionally, they provide a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

However, the computational cost and memory requirement renders these methods unsuitable on the mobile device. In this paper, we introduce a new method squeeze-enhanced Axial Transformer (SeaFormer) for mobile visual recognition. Specifically, we design a generic attention block characterized by the formulation of squeeze Axial and detail enhancement. It can be further used to create a family of backbone architectures with superior cost-effectiveness. Coupled with a light segmentation head, we achieve the best trade-off between segmentation accuracy and latency on the ARM-based mobile devices on the ADE20K, Cityscapes, Pascal Context and COCO-Stuff datasets. Critically, we beat both the mobilefriendly rivals and Transformer-based counterparts with better performance and lower latency without bells and whistles. Furthermore, we incorporate a feature upsampling-based multi-resolution distillation technique, further reducing the inference latency of the proposed framework. Beyond semantic segmentation, we further apply the proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification and object detection problems, demonstrating the potential of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone.

| **[AIQViT: Architecture-Informed Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04628v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising solution for reducing the storage and computational cost of vision transformers (ViTs). Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this task remains challenging due to the overlapping imaging characteristics of PsP and TP. This study therefore proposes a multimodal deep-learning approach utilizing complementary information from routine anatomical MR images, clinical parameters, and RT treatment planning information for improved predictive accuracy. The approach utilizes a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) to encode multi-sequence MR brain volumes to effectively capture both global and local context from the high dimensional input. The encoder is trained in a self-supervised upstream task on unlabeled glioma MRI datasets from the open BraTS2021, UPenn-GBM, and UCSF-PDGM datasets to generate compact, clinically relevant representations from FLAIR and T1 post-contrast sequences. These encoded MR inputs are then integrated with clinical data and RT treatment planning information through guided cross-modal attention, improving progression classification accuracy. This work was developed using two datasets from different centers: the Burdenko Glioblastoma Progression Dataset (n = 59) for training and validation, and the GlioCMV progression dataset from the University Hospital Erlangen (UKER) (n = 20) for testing. The proposed method achieved an AUC of 75.3%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art data-driven approaches. Importantly, the proposed approach relies on readily available anatomical MRI sequences, clinical data, and RT treatment planning information, enhancing its clinical feasibility. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of limited data availability for PsP and TP differentiation and could allow for improved clinical decision-making and optimized treatment plans for GBM patients.</p></details> |  | None |

However, early screening for HCC using ultrasound suffers from insufficient sensitivity and is highly dependent on the expertise of radiologists for interpretation. Leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, this study proposes an innovative Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer (HSQformer) model that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance the accuracy of HCC diagnosis in ultrasound screening. The HSQformer leverages sparse latent space representations to capture hierarchical details at various granularities without the need for complex adjustments, and adopts a modular, plug-and-play design philosophy, ensuring the model's versatility and ease of use. The HSQformer's performance was rigorously tested across three distinct clinical scenarios: single-center, multi-center, and high-risk patient testing. In each of these settings, it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art models, such as ConvNext and SwinTransformer. Notably, the HSQformer even matched the diagnostic capabilities of senior radiologists and comprehensively surpassed those of junior radiologists. The experimental results from this study strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical potential of AI-assisted tools in HCC screening.

| **[Brain Tumor Identification using Improved YOLOv8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03746v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the extent of brain tumors is a significant challenge in brain cancer treatment. The main difficulty is in the approximate detection of tumor size. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a critical diagnostic tool. However, manually detecting the boundaries of brain tumors from MRI scans is a labor-intensive task that requires extensive expertise. Deep learning and computer-aided detection techniques have led to notable advances in machine learning for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a modified You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model to accurately detect the tumors within the MRI images. The proposed model replaced the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm with a Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT- DETR) in the detection head. NMS filters out redundant or overlapping bounding boxes in the detected tumors, but they are hand-designed and pre-set. RT-DETR removes hand-designed components. The second improvement was made by replacing the normal convolution block with ghost convolution. Ghost Convolution reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining high accuracy and enabling faster inference, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. The third improvement was made by introducing a vision transformer block in the backbone of YOLOv8 to extract context-aware features. We used a publicly available dataset of brain tumors in the proposed model. The proposed model performed better than the original YOLOv8 model and also performed better than other object detectors (Faster R- CNN, Mask R-CNN, YOLO, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, SSD, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, and DETR). The proposed model achieved 0.91 mAP (mean Average Precision)@0.5.</p></details> |  | None |

By compressing the spatial size of images, this approach can effectively shorten the token sequence and reduce the computational cost of ViT-like plain architectures. In this work, we aim to thoroughly examine the information loss caused by this patchification-based compressive encoding paradigm and how it affects visual understanding. We conduct extensive patch size scaling experiments and excitedly observe an intriguing scaling law in patchification: the models can consistently benefit from decreased patch sizes and attain improved predictive performance, until it reaches the minimum patch size of 1x1, i.e., pixel tokenization. This conclusion is broadly applicable across different vision tasks, various input scales, and diverse architectures such as ViT and the recent Mamba models. Moreover, as a by-product, we discover that with smaller patches, task-specific decoder heads become less critical for dense prediction. In the experiments, we successfully scale up the visual sequence to an exceptional length of 50,176 tokens, achieving a competitive test accuracy of 84.6% with a base-sized model on the ImageNet-1k benchmark. We hope this study can provide insights and theoretical foundations for future works of building non-compressive vision models.

In this work, we propose \textit{Vision In-Context Operator Networks} (VICON), incorporating a vision transformer architecture that efficiently processes 2D functions through patch-wise operations. We evaluated our method on three fluid dynamics datasets, demonstrating both superior performance (reducing the rescaled $L^2$ error by $40\%$ and $61.6\%$ for two benchmark datasets for compressible flows, respectively) and computational efficiency (requiring only one-third of the inference time per frame) in long-term rollout predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model with fixed timestep prediction: Multiple Physics Pretraining (MPP). Compared to MPP, our method preserves the benefits of in-context operator learning, enabling flexible context formation when dealing with insufficient frame counts or varying timestep values.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update 2 more experiments compared to original submission; minor writing adjustments</p></details> | None |

The predominant models use the so-called transformer network and have a large field of applicability, including predicting text and images, classification, and even predicting solutions to the dynamics of physical systems. Here we present a variational quantum circuit architecture named Self-Attention Sequential Quantum Transformer Channel (SASQuaTCh), which builds networks of qubits that perform analogous operations of the transformer network, namely the keystone self-attention operation, and leads to an exponential improvement in parameter complexity and run-time complexity over its classical counterpart. Our approach leverages recent insights from kernel-based operator learning in the context of predicting spatiotemporal systems to represent deep layers of a vision transformer network using simple gate operations and a set of multi-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms. To validate our approach, we consider image classification tasks in simulation and with hardware, where with only 9 qubits and a handful of parameters we are able to simultaneously embed and classify a grayscale image of handwritten digits with high accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |

Traditional supervised learningbased segmentation techniques require extensive annotated datasets, which are impractical for the diversity of objects encountered in real-world scenarios. Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS) methods aim to address this by training models on synthetic data to generalize to novel objects, but they often suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap. This paper proposes a novel approach (ZISVFM) for solving UOIS by leveraging the powerful zero-shot capability of the segment anything model (SAM) and explicit visual representations from a selfsupervised vision transformer (ViT). The proposed framework operates in three stages: (1) generating object-agnostic mask proposals from colorized depth images using SAM, (2) refining these proposals using attention-based features from the selfsupervised ViT to filter non-object masks, and (3) applying K-Medoids clustering to generate point prompts that guide SAM towards precise object segmentation. Experimental validation on two benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrates the superior performance of ZISVFM in complex environments, including hierarchical settings such as cabinets, drawers, and handheld objects.

Recent empirical observations reveal that MAE and CL capture different types of representations: CL tends to focus on global patterns, while MAE adeptly captures both global and subtle local information simultaneously. Despite a flurry of recent empirical investigations to shed light on this difference, theoretical understanding remains limited, especially on the dominant architecture vision transformers (ViTs). In this paper, to provide rigorous insights, we model the visual data distribution by considering two types of spatial features: dominant global features and comparatively minuscule local features, and study the impact of imbalance among these features. We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer softmax-based ViTs on both MAE and CL objectives using gradient descent. Our analysis shows that as the degree of feature imbalance varies, ViTs trained with the MAE objective effectively learn both global and local features to achieve near-optimal reconstruction, while the CL-trained ViTs favor predominantly global features, even under mild imbalance. These results provide a theoretical explanation for distinct behaviors of MAE and CL observed in empirical studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

With the advent of advanced computing technology, CNN models have achieved to remarkable success, particularly in computer vision applications. Nevertheless, the efficacy of the conventional CNN is often hindered due to class imbalance and inter-class similarity problems, which are particularly prominent in the computer vision field. In this research, we introduce for the first time an ``Edge Attention Module (EAM)'' consisting of a Max-Min pooling layer, followed by convolutional layers. This Max-Min pooling is entirely a novel pooling technique, specifically designed to capture only the edge information that is crucial for any object classification task. Therefore, by integrating this novel pooling technique into the attention module, the CNN network inherently prioritizes on essential edge features, thereby boosting the accuracy and F1-score of the model significantly. We have implemented our proposed EAM or 2EAMs on several standard pre-trained CNN models for Caltech-101, Caltech-256, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet-200 datasets. The extensive experiments reveal that our proposed framework (that is, EAM with CNN and 2EAMs with CNN), outperforms all pre-trained CNN models as well as recent trend models ``Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT)'', ``Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)'', and ConvNext, by substantial margins. We have achieved the accuracy of 95.5% and 86% by the proposed framework on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets, respectively. So far, this is the best results on these datasets, to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> | 11 pages | None |

However, traditional manual labeling involves high cost to annotate the vast amount of required data for training robust model. To mitigate this cost of manual labeling, we propose a Label Anything Model (denoted as LAM), serving as an interpretable, high-fidelity, and prompt-free data annotator. Specifically, we firstly incorporate a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract the latent features. On top of ViT, we propose a semantic class adapter (SCA) and an optimization-oriented unrolling algorithm (OptOU), both with a quite small number of trainable parameters. SCA is proposed to fuse ViT-extracted features to consolidate the basis of the subsequent automatic annotation. OptOU consists of multiple cascading layers and each layer contains an optimization formulation to align its output with the ground truth as closely as possible, though which OptOU acts as being interpretable rather than learning-based blackbox nature. In addition, training SCA and OptOU requires only a single pre-annotated RGB seed image, owing to their small volume of learnable parameters. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed LAM can generate high-fidelity annotations (almost 100% in mIoU) for multiple real-world datasets (i.e., Camvid, Cityscapes, and Apolloscapes) and CARLA simulation dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Maximizing the Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Global Average Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02919v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vision transformers, position embedding (PE) plays a crucial role in capturing the order of tokens. However, in vision transformer structures, there is a limitation in the expressiveness of PE due to the structure where position embedding is simply added to the token embedding. A layer-wise method that delivers PE to each layer and applies independent Layer Normalizations for token embedding and PE has been adopted to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we identify the conflicting result that occurs in a layer-wise structure when using the global average pooling (GAP) method instead of the class token. To overcome this problem, we propose MPVG, which maximizes the effectiveness of PE in a layer-wise structure with GAP. Specifically, we identify that PE counterbalances token embedding values at each layer in a layer-wise structure. Furthermore, we recognize that the counterbalancing role of PE is insufficient in the layer-wise structure, and we address this by maximizing the effectiveness of PE through MPVG.

| **[Rethinking Vision Transformer for Object Centric Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02763v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent state-of-the-art object segmentation mechanisms, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and FastSAM, first encode the full image over several layers and then focus on generating the mask for one particular object or area. We present an off-grid Fovea-Like Input Patching (FLIP) approach, which selects image input and encodes it from the beginning in an object-focused manner. While doing so, it separates locational encoding from an object-centric perceptual code. FLIP is more data-efficient and yields improved segmentation performance when masking relatively small objects in high-resolution visual scenes. On standard benchmarks such as Hypersim, KITTI-360, and OpenImages, FLIP achieves Intersection over Union (IoU) scores that approach the performance of SAM with much less compute effort. It surpasses FastSAM in all IoU measurements. We also introduce an additional semi-natural but highly intuitive dataset where FLIP outperforms SAM and FastSAM overall and particularly on relatively small objects. Seeing that FLIP is an end-to-end object-centric segmentation approach, it has high potential particularly for applications that benefit from computationally efficient, spatially highly selective object tracking.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a dual contribution: first, a systematic analysis of current methodological practices in skin disease classification research, revealing substantial inconsistencies in data preparation, augmentation strategies, and performance reporting; second, a comprehensive training and evaluation framework demonstrated through experiments with the DINOv2-Large vision transformer across three benchmark datasets (HAM10000, DermNet, ISIC Atlas). The analysis identifies concerning patterns, including pre-split data augmentation and validation-based reporting, potentially leading to overestimated metrics, while highlighting the lack of unified methodology standards. The experimental results demonstrate DINOv2's performance in skin disease classification, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.85 (HAM10000), 0.71 (DermNet), and 0.84 (ISIC Atlas). Attention map analysis reveals critical patterns in the model's decision-making, showing sophisticated feature recognition in typical presentations but significant vulnerabilities with atypical cases and composite images. Our findings highlight the need for standardized evaluation protocols and careful implementation strategies in clinical settings. We propose comprehensive methodological recommendations for model development, evaluation, and clinical deployment, emphasizing rigorous data preparation, systematic error analysis, and specialized protocols for different image types. To promote reproducibility, we provide our implementation code through GitHub. This work establishes a foundation for rigorous evaluation standards in dermatological image classification and provides insights for responsible AI implementation in clinical dermatology.</p></details> | 60 pages, 69 figures | None |

However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent advances in self-supervised pre-training have shown remarkable potential for improving model generalization in various vision tasks, their effectiveness in gaze estimation remains unexplored due to the geometric nature of the gaze regression task. We propose UniGaze, which leverages large-scale, in-the-wild facial datasets through self-supervised pre-training for gaze estimation. We carefully curate multiple facial datasets that capture diverse variations in identity, lighting, background, and head poses. By directly applying Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training on normalized face images with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, our UniGaze learns appropriate feature representations within the specific input space required by downstream gaze estimation models. Through comprehensive experiments using challenging cross-dataset evaluation and novel protocols, including leave-one-dataset-out and joint-dataset settings, we demonstrate that UniGaze significantly improves generalization across multiple data domains while minimizing reliance on costly labeled data. The source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, token reduction performs less effectively on Vision Mamba compared to ViTs. Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and bad performance. This makes it not a good solution for enhancing efficiency in Mamba. Token merging, which preserves more token information than pruning, has demonstrated commendable performance in ViTs. Nevertheless, vanilla merging performance decreases as the reduction ratio increases either, failing to maintain the key knowledge in Mamba. Re-training the token-reduced model enhances the performance of Mamba, by effectively rebuilding the key knowledge. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drop 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Accurate Post-Training Quantization of Vision Transformers via Error Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06794v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) for vision transformers (ViTs) has received increasing attention from both academic and industrial communities due to its minimal data needs and high time efficiency. However, many current methods fail to account for the complex interactions between quantized weights and activations, resulting in significant quantization errors and suboptimal performance. This paper presents ERQ, an innovative two-step PTQ method specifically crafted to reduce quantization errors arising from activation and weight quantization sequentially. The first step, Activation quantization error reduction (Aqer), first applies Reparameterization Initialization aimed at mitigating initial quantization errors in high-variance activations. Then, it further mitigates the errors by formulating a Ridge Regression problem, which updates the weights maintained at full-precision using a closed-form solution. The second step, Weight quantization error reduction (Wqer), first applies Dual Uniform Quantization to handle weights with numerous outliers, which arise from adjustments made during Reparameterization Initialization, thereby reducing initial weight quantization errors. Then, it employs an iterative approach to further tackle the errors. In each iteration, it adopts Rounding Refinement that uses an empirically derived, efficient proxy to refine the rounding directions of quantized weights, complemented by a Ridge Regression solver to reduce the errors. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate ERQ's superior performance across various ViTs variants and tasks. For example, ERQ surpasses the state-of-the-art GPTQ by a notable 36.81% in accuracy for W3A4 ViT-S.

In this work, we propose META, a simple and fast ViT adapter that can improve the model's memory efficiency and decrease memory time consumption by reducing the inefficient memory access operations. Our method features a memory-efficient adapter block that enables the common sharing of layer normalization between the self-attention and feed-forward network layers, thereby reducing the model's reliance on normalization operations. Within the proposed block, the cross-shaped self-attention is employed to reduce the model's frequent reshaping operations. Moreover, we augment the adapter block with a lightweight convolutional branch that can enhance local inductive biases, particularly beneficial for the dense prediction tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The adapter block is finally formulated in a cascaded manner to compute diverse head features, thereby enriching the variety of feature representations. Empirically, extensive evaluations on multiple representative datasets validate that META substantially enhances the predicted quality, while achieving a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Theoretically, we demonstrate that META exhibits superior generalization capability and stronger adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering (AI-SOFT), Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, 2024</p></details> | None |

This has led to efforts to forward-align these models with carefully annotated abstract, human-understandable semantic entities - concepts. Concepts provide global rationales to the model predictions and can be quickly understood/intervened on by domain experts. Most current research focuses on designing model-agnostic, plug-and-play generic concept-based explainability modules that do not incorporate the inner workings of foundation models (e.g., inductive biases, scale invariance, etc.) during training. To alleviate this issue for ViTs, in this paper, we propose ASCENT-ViT, an attention-based, concept learning framework that effectively composes scale and position-aware representations from multiscale feature pyramids and ViT patch representations, respectively. Further, these representations are aligned with concept annotations through attention matrices - which incorporate spatial and global (semantic) concepts. ASCENT-ViT can be utilized as a classification head on top of standard ViT backbones for improved predictive performance and accurate and robust concept explanations as demonstrated on five datasets, including three widely used benchmarks (CUB, Pascal APY, Concept-MNIST) and 2 real-world datasets (AWA2, KITS).</p></details> |  | None |

On the Training Dynamics of Representations in Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17377v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we elucidate how representations in deep neural networks (DNNs) evolve during training. Our focus is on overparameterized learning settings where the training continues much after the trained DNN starts to perfectly fit its training data. We examine the evolution of learned representations along the entire training process. We explore the representational similarity of DNN layers, each layer with respect to its own representations throughout the training process. For this, we use two similarity metrics: (1) The centered kernel alignment (CKA) similarity; (2) Similarity of decision regions of linear classifier probes that we train for the DNN layers. We visualize and analyze the decision regions of the DNN output and the layer probes during the DNN training to show how they geometrically evolve. Our extensive experiments discover training dynamics patterns that can emerge in layers depending on the relative layer-depth, architecture and optimizer. Among our findings: (i) The training phases, including those related to memorization, are more distinguishable in SGD training than in Adam training, and for Vision Transformer (ViT) than for ResNet; (ii) Unlike ResNet, the ViT layers have synchronized dynamics of representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[How to set AdamW's weight decay as you scale model and dataset size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13698v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling of the optimal AdamW weight decay hyperparameter with model and dataset size is critical as we seek to build larger models, but is poorly understood. We show that weights learned by AdamW can be understood as an exponential moving average (EMA) of recent updates. This gives critical insights for how to set the weight decay in AdamW, and how the weight decay should scale with model and dataset size. In particular, the key hyperparameter for an exponential moving average is the EMA timescale. Intuitively, the EMA timescale can be understood as the number of recent iterations the EMA averages over. We find that the optimal timescale, measured in epochs, is roughly constant as we change model and dataset size. Moreover, given a learning rate, there is a one-to-one mapping from the EMA timescale to the weight decay hyperparameter. Thus, if the optimal EMA timescale is constant, that implies that as the dataset size increases, the optimal weight decay should fall and as the model size increases, the optimal weight decay should increase (if we follow the muP recommendation for scaling the learning rate). We validate these scaling rules on ResNet-18 and Vision Transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and on NanoGPT pre-training on OpenWebText. Finally, we found that as training progresses, muP's learning rate scaling breaks down for AdamW unless weight decay is scaled appropriately.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods based on local convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle to capture global features efficiently, while Transformer-based models are computationally expensive, although they excel at global modeling. Mamba addresses these limitations by leveraging selective structured state space models (S4) to effectively handle long-range dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. In this paper, we propose FusionMamba, a novel dynamic feature enhancement framework that aims to overcome the challenges faced by CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks. The framework improves the visual state-space model Mamba by integrating dynamic convolution and channel attention mechanisms, which not only retains its powerful global feature modeling capability, but also greatly reduces redundancy and enhances the expressiveness of local features. In addition, we have developed a new module called the dynamic feature fusion module (DFFM). It combines the dynamic feature enhancement module (DFEM) for texture enhancement and disparity perception with the cross-modal fusion Mamba module (CMFM), which focuses on enhancing the inter-modal correlation while suppressing redundant information. Experiments show that FusionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of multimodal image fusion tasks as well as downstream experiments, demonstrating its broad applicability and superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Visual Intelligence.

Although these models are assumed to protect sensitive information in their training data, the extent to which this assumption holds for different architectures remains unexplored. This assumption is challenged by inversion attacks which attempt to reconstruct training data from model weights, exposing significant privacy vulnerabilities. In this study, we systematically evaluate the privacy-preserving properties of vision classifiers across diverse architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques, we assess the extent to which these architectures memorize and reveal training data, quantifying the relative ease of reconstruction across models. Our analysis highlights how architectural differences, such as input representation, feature extraction mechanisms, and weight structures, influence privacy risks. By comparing these architectures, we identify which are more resilient to inversion attacks and examine the trade-offs between model performance and privacy preservation, contributing to the development of secure and privacy-respecting machine learning models for sensitive applications. Our findings provide actionable insights into the design of secure and privacy-aware machine learning systems, emphasizing the importance of evaluating architectural decisions in sensitive applications involving proprietary or personal data.</p></details> |  | None |

Mamba, unlike Vision Transformers, achieves linear complexity for token interactions through a recurrent hidden state process. This sequential processing is enhanced by a parallel scan algorithm, which reduces the computational time of recurrent steps from $L$ sequential steps to $log(L)$ parallel steps with respect to the number of input tokens ($L$). In this work, we propose Fast Vision Mamba (FastVim), that further reduces the computational time of the SSM block by reducing the number of recurrent steps in Vision Mamba models while still retaining model performance. By alternately pooling tokens along image dimensions across Mamba blocks, we obtain a 2$\times$ reduction in the number of parallel steps in SSM block. Our model offers up to $72.5\%$ speedup in inference speed compared to baseline Vision Mamba models on high resolution (2048$\times$2048) images.

Forward-Forward is a new training algorithm that is more similar to what occurs in the brain, although there is a significant performance gap compared to backpropagation. In the Forward-Forward algorithm, the loss functions are placed after each layer, and the updating of a layer is done using two local forward passes and one local backward pass. Forward-Forward is in its early stages and has been designed and evaluated on simple multi-layer perceptron networks to solve image classification tasks. In this work, we have extended the use of this algorithm to a more complex and modern network, namely the Vision Transformer. Inspired by insights from contrastive learning, we have attempted to revise this algorithm, leading to the introduction of Contrastive Forward-Forward. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the baseline Forward-Forward leading to an increase of up to 10% in accuracy and boosting the convergence speed by 5 to 20 times on Vision Transformer. Furthermore, if we take Cross Entropy as the baseline loss function in backpropagation, it will be demonstrated that the proposed modifications to the baseline Forward-Forward reduce its performance gap compared to backpropagation on Vision Transformer, and even outperforms it in certain conditions, such as inaccurate supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> | None |

Increased extreme weather events associated with climate change can result in alterations to river and stream connectivity. While traditional stream flow gauges are costly to deploy and limited to large river bodies, trail camera methods are a low-cost and easily deployed alternative to collect hourly data. Image capturing, however requires stream ecologists to manually curate (select and label) tens of thousands of images per year. To improve this workflow, we developed an automated instream trail camera image classification system consisting of three parts: (1) image processing, (2) image augmentation and (3) machine learning. The image preprocessing consists of seven image quality filters, foliage-based luma variance reduction, resizing and bottom-center cropping. Images are balanced using variable amount of generative augmentation using diffusion models and then passed to a machine learning classification model in labeled form. By using the vision transformer architecture and temporal image enhancement in our framework, we are able to increase the 75% base accuracy to 90% for a new unseen site image. We make use of a dataset captured and labeled by staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection between 2018-2020. Our results indicate that a combination of temporal image processing and attention-based models are effective at classifying unseen river connectivity images.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures | None |

We then define a safety threshold for a class as the smallest distance from an incorrect prediction to the given class centroid. We evaluate the approach on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a Convolutional Neural Network and a Vision Transformer, respectively. The results show that our approach is consistent across these data sets and network models, and indicate that the proposed metric can offer an efficient way of determining when automated predictions are acceptable and when they should be deferred to human operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.07821</p></details> | None |

In the Earth science and remote sensing communities, there is growing interest in transforming the use of Earth observation data, including satellite and aerial imagery, through foundation models. Various foundation models have been developed for remote sensing, such as those for multispectral, high-resolution, and hyperspectral images, and have demonstrated superior performance on various downstream tasks compared to traditional supervised models. These models are evolving rapidly, with capabilities to handle multispectral, multitemporal, and multisensor data. Most studies use masked autoencoders in combination with Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the backbone for pretraining. While the models showed promising performance, ViTs face challenges, such as quadratic computational scaling with input length, which may limit performance on multiband and multitemporal data with long sequences. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing SatMamba, a new pretraining framework that combines masked autoencoders with State Space Model, offering linear computational scaling. Experiments on high-resolution imagery across various downstream tasks show promising results, paving the way for more efficient foundation models and unlocking the full potential of Earth observation data.

Deep learning has massively improved segmentation methods, but challenges remain in generalization to new conditions, requiring costly data annotation. Vision foundation models, such as Segment Anything Model (SAM), address this issue through broad segmentation capabilities. However, these models still require finetuning on annotated data, although with less annotations, to achieve optimal results for new conditions. As a downside, they require more computational resources. This makes parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) relevant for their application.

Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, which often suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and rely on multi-stage object detection pipelines, this study employs a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model as the backbone, which excels at capturing global features for depth estimation. It integrates a detection transformer (DETR) architecture to improve both depth estimation and object detection performance in a one-stage manner. Specifically, a hierarchical feature fusion block is introduced to extract richer visual features from the foundation model, further enhancing feature extraction capabilities. Depth estimation accuracy is further improved by incorporating a relative depth estimation model trained on large-scale data and fine-tuning it through transfer learning. Additionally, the use of queries in the transformer's decoder, which consider reference points and the dimensions of 2D bounding boxes, enhances recognition performance.

Estimating tumor volume is difficult due to their irregular shapes, and manual segmentation is time-consuming. Automatic segmentation using U-Net and its variants, incorporating Vision Transformer (ViT) elements, has shown promising results but struggles with high computational demands. To address this, architectures like the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) and Extended Long-Short Term Memory (xLSTM) offer efficient solutions by handling long-range dependencies with lower resource consumption. This study evaluates U-Net enhancements, including CNN, ViT, Mamba, and xLSTM, on a new in-house CT dataset and a public organ segmentation dataset. The proposed ViLU-Net model integrates Vi-blocks for improved segmentation. Results highlight xLSTM's efficiency in the U-Net framework.

| **[Improving Vision Transformers by Overlapping Heads in Multi-Head Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14874v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers have made remarkable progress in recent years, achieving state-of-the-art performance in most vision tasks. A key component of this success is due to the introduction of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) module, which enables each head to learn different representations by applying the attention mechanism independently. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that Vision Transformers can be further enhanced by overlapping the heads in MHSA. We introduce Multi-Overlapped-Head Self-Attention (MOHSA), where heads are overlapped with their two adjacent heads for queries, keys, and values, while zero-padding is employed for the first and last heads, which have only one neighboring head. Various paradigms for overlapping ratios are proposed to fully investigate the optimal performance of our approach. The proposed approach is evaluated using five Transformer models on four benchmark datasets and yields a significant performance boost.

| **[ContextFormer: Redefining Efficiency in Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19255v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation assigns labels to pixels in images, a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Convolutional methods, although capturing local dependencies well, struggle with long-range relationships. Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in global context capture but are hindered by high computational demands, especially for high-resolution inputs. Most research optimizes the encoder architecture, leaving the bottleneck underexplored - a key area for enhancing performance and efficiency. We propose ContextFormer, a hybrid framework leveraging the strengths of CNNs and ViTs in the bottleneck to balance efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for real-time semantic segmentation. The framework's efficiency is driven by three synergistic modules: the Token Pyramid Extraction Module (TPEM) for hierarchical multi-scale representation, the Transformer and Modulating DepthwiseConv (Trans-MDC) block for dynamic scale-aware feature modeling, and the Feature Merging Module (FMM) for robust integration with enhanced spatial and contextual consistency. Extensive experiments on ADE20K, Pascal Context, CityScapes, and COCO-Stuff datasets show ContextFormer significantly outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art mIoU scores, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and performance.

To address this, we present CerraData-4MM, a multimodal dataset combining Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imagery (MSI) with 10m spatial resolution. The dataset includes two hierarchical classification levels with 7 and 14 classes, respectively, focusing on the diverse Bico do Papagaio ecoregion. We highlight CerraData-4MM's capacity to benchmark advanced semantic segmentation techniques by evaluating a standard U-Net and a more sophisticated Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The ViT achieves superior performance in multimodal scenarios, with the highest macro F1-score of 57.60% and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 49.05% at the first hierarchical level. Both models struggle with minority classes, particularly at the second hierarchical level, where U-Net's performance drops to an F1-score of 18.16%. Class balancing improves representation for underrepresented classes but reduces overall accuracy, underscoring the trade-off in weighted training.

However, subjective assessment is highly variable and can underestimate the degree of response in some patients, subjecting them to unnecessary surgery, or overestimate response that places patients at risk of disease spread. Advances in deep learning has shown the ability to produce consistent and objective response assessment for endoscopic images. However, methods for detecting cancers, regrowth, and monitoring response during the entire course of patient treatment and follow-up are lacking. This is because, automated diagnosis and rectal cancer response assessment requires methods that are robust to inherent imaging illumination variations and confounding conditions (blood, scope, blurring) present in endoscopy images as well as changes to the normal lumen and tumor during treatment. Hence, a hierarchical shifted window (Swin) transformer was trained to distinguish rectal cancer from normal lumen using endoscopy images. Swin as well as two convolutional (ResNet-50, WideResNet-50), and vision transformer (ViT) models were trained and evaluated on follow-up longitudinal images to detect LR on private dataset as well as on out-of-distribution (OOD) public colonoscopy datasets to detect pre/non-cancerous polyps. Color shifts were applied using optimal transport to simulate distribution shifts. Swin and ResNet models were similarly accurate in the in-distribution dataset. Swin was more accurate than other methods (follow-up: 0.84, OOD: 0.83) even when subject to color shifts (follow-up: 0.83, OOD: 0.87), indicating capability to provide robust performance for longitudinal cancer assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SPIE Medical Imaging 2025</p></details> | None |

These assessments include temporal data with varying sampling rates, discrete single-point measurements, therapeutic interventions such as medication administration, and images. While physicians are able to process and integrate diverse modalities intuitively, neural networks need specific modeling for each modality complicating the training procedure. We demonstrate that this complexity can be significantly reduced by visualizing all information as images along with unstructured text and subsequently training a conventional vision-text transformer. Our approach, Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements (ViTiMM), not only simplifies data preprocessing and modeling but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping, as evaluated on 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The modalities include patient's clinical measurements, medications, X-ray images, and electrocardiography scans. We hope our work inspires advancements in multi-modal medical AI by reducing the training complexity to (visual) prompt engineering, thus lowering entry barriers and enabling no-code solutions for training.

In this paper, we propose SpectralKD, a novel unified analytical framework that offers deeper insights into ViTs and optimizes KD via spectral analysis. Our model-wise analysis reveals that CaiT concentrates information in their first and last few layers, informing optimal layer selection for KD. Surprisingly, our layer-wise analysis discovers that Swin Transformer and CaiT exhibit similar spectral encoding patterns despite their architectural differences, leading to feature map alignment guideline. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective spectral alignment method for KD. Benefiting from the deeper understanding by above analysis results, even such a simple strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K without introducing any trainable parameters, improving DeiT-Tiny by $+5.2\%$ and Swin-Tiny by $+1.4\%$ in top-1 accuracy. Furthermore, our post-training analysis reveals that distilled students can reproduce spectral patterns similar to their teachers, opening a new area we term ``distillation dynamics".

Radar serves as a reliable and low-cost sensor that can effectively complement these limitations. However, radar-based object detection has been underexplored due to the inherent weaknesses of radar data, such as low resolution, high noise, and lack of visual information. In this paper, we present TransRAD, a novel 3D radar object detection model designed to address these challenges by leveraging the Retentive Vision Transformer (RMT) to more effectively learn features from information-dense radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) data. Our approach leverages the Retentive Manhattan Self-Attention (MaSA) mechanism provided by RMT to incorporate explicit spatial priors, thereby enabling more accurate alignment with the spatial saliency characteristics of radar targets in RAD data and achieving precise 3D radar detection across Range-Azimuth-Doppler dimensions. Furthermore, we propose Location-Aware NMS to effectively mitigate the common issue of duplicate bounding boxes in deep radar object detection. The experimental results demonstrate that TransRAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both 2D and 3D radar detection tasks, achieving higher accuracy, faster inference speed, and reduced computational complexity.

Although traditional methods, such as occupancy mapping, provide a basic framework, they often fail to account for the complex mobility capabilities of some platforms such as legged robots. In this work, we propose a method for estimating terrain traversability by learning from demonstrations of human walking. Our approach leverages dense, pixel-wise feature embeddings generated using the DINOv2 vision Transformer model, which are processed through an encoder-decoder MLP architecture to analyze terrain segments. The averaged feature vectors, extracted from the masked regions of interest, are used to train the model in a reconstruction-based framework. By minimizing reconstruction loss, the network distinguishes between familiar terrain with a low reconstruction error and unfamiliar or hazardous terrain with a higher reconstruction error. This approach facilitates the detection of anomalies, allowing a legged robot to navigate more effectively through challenging terrain. We run real-world experiments on the ANYmal legged robot both indoor and outdoor to prove our proposed method.

Despite its clinical significance, developing OCT-based diagnostic tools faces challenges, such as limited public datasets, sparse annotations, and privacy concerns. Although deep learning has made progress in automating OCT analysis, these challenges remain unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce the Vision Transformer-based Dual-Stream Self-Supervised Pretraining Network (ViT-2SPN), a novel framework designed to enhance feature extraction and improve diagnostic accuracy. ViT-2SPN employs a three-stage workflow: Supervised Pretraining, Self-Supervised Pretraining (SSP), and Supervised Fine-Tuning. The pretraining phase leverages the OCTMNIST dataset (97,477 unlabeled images across four disease classes) with data augmentation to create dual-augmented views. A Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) backbone extracts features, while a negative cosine similarity loss aligns feature representations. Pretraining is conducted over 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.0001 and momentum of 0.999. Fine-tuning is performed on a stratified 5.129% subset of OCTMNIST using 10-fold cross-validation. ViT-2SPN achieves a mean AUC of 0.93, accuracy of 0.77, precision of 0.81, recall of 0.75, and an F1 score of 0.76, outperforming existing SSP-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

This limits their utility for brain computer interfaces (BCI) or neurofeedback, for which it would be useful to pool experiences across individuals to better simulate stimuli not sampled during training. A key obstacle to model generalisation is the degree of variability of inter-subject cortical organisation, which makes it difficult to align or compare cortical signals across participants. In this paper we address this through the use of surface vision transformers, which build a generalisable model of cortical functional dynamics, through encoding the topography of cortical networks and their interactions as a moving image across a surface. This is then combined with tri-modal self-supervised contrastive (CLIP) alignment of audio, video, and fMRI modalities to enable the retrieval of visual and auditory stimuli from patterns of cortical activity (and vice-versa). We validate our approach on 7T task-fMRI data from 174 healthy participants engaged in the movie-watching experiment from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Results show that it is possible to detect which movie clips an individual is watching purely from their brain activity, even for individuals and movies not seen during training. Further analysis of attention maps reveals that our model captures individual patterns of brain activity that reflect semantic and visual systems. This opens the door to future personalised simulations of brain function.

While traditional segmentation methods have achieved remarkable success, their generalization to diverse scenes and unseen object categories remains limited. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for bridging visual and textual modalities, providing a deeper understanding of semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose LangSeg, a novel LLM-guided semantic segmentation method that leverages context-sensitive, fine-grained subclass descriptors generated by LLMs. Our framework integrates these descriptors with a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to achieve superior segmentation performance without extensive model retraining. We evaluate LangSeg on two challenging datasets, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to a 6.1% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study and human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that LangSeg not only excels in semantic understanding and contextual alignment but also provides a flexible and efficient framework for language-guided segmentation tasks. This approach opens up new possibilities for interactive and domain-specific segmentation applications.</p></details> |  | None |

The ability to trace the origin of an image/video can aid law enforcement agencies in gathering evidence and constructing the timeline of events. Moreover, identifying the owner of a certain device narrows down the area of search in a criminal investigation where smartphone devices are involved. This paper proposes a new pixel-based method for source camera identification, integrating Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision Transformer network (ViT), and named PDC-ViT. While the PDC acts as the backbone for feature extraction by exploiting Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC (RPDC). These techniques enhance the capability to capture subtle variations in pixel information, which are crucial for distinguishing between different source cameras. The second part of the methodology focuses on classification, which is based on a Vision Transformer network. Unlike traditional methods that utilize image patches directly for training the classification network, the proposed approach uniquely inputs PDC features into the Vision Transformer network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDC-ViT approach, it has been assessed on five different datasets, which include various image contents and video scenes. The method has also been compared with state-of-the-art source camera identification methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to its competitors. For example, our proposed PDC-ViT has achieved an accuracy of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22% and 92.29% using the Vision dataset, Daxing dataset, Socrates dataset and QUFVD dataset, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to high-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both global interactions and local representations while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further pre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution 384$^2$. For downstream tasks, L$^2$ViT delivers favorable performance as a backbone on object detection as well as semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |

We validate the performance of the video vision transformer using the ADNI dataset and conduct comparative analyses with other relevant models. Results The proposed ViTranZheimer model is compared with two hybrid models, CNN-BiLSTM and ViT-BiLSTM. CNN-BiLSTM is the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long-short-term memory network (BiLSTM), while ViT-BiLSTM is the combination of a vision transformer (ViT) with BiLSTM. The accuracy levels achieved in the ViTranZheimer, CNN-BiLSTM, and ViT-BiLSTM models are 98.6%, 96.479%, and 97.465%, respectively. ViTranZheimer demonstrated the highest accuracy at 98.6%, outperforming other models in this evaluation metric, indicating its superior performance in this specific evaluation metric.

However, the non-negative constraint on feature maps and the relaxed exponential function used in approximation lead to significant information loss compared to the original query-key dot products, resulting in less discriminative attention maps with higher entropy. To address the missing interactions driven by negative values in query-key pairs, we propose a polarity-aware linear attention mechanism that explicitly models both same-signed and opposite-signed query-key interactions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relational information. Furthermore, to restore the spiky properties of attention maps, we provide a theoretical analysis proving the existence of a class of element-wise functions (with positive first and second derivatives) that can reduce entropy in the attention distribution. For simplicity, and recognizing the distinct contributions of each dimension, we employ a learnable power function for rescaling, allowing strong and weak attention signals to be effectively separated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PolaFormer improves performance on various vision tasks, enhancing both expressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.6%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[B-cosification: Transforming Deep Neural Networks to be Inherently Interpretable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00715v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>B-cos Networks have been shown to be effective for obtaining highly human interpretable explanations of model decisions by architecturally enforcing stronger alignment between inputs and weight. B-cos variants of convolutional networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), which primarily replace linear layers with B-cos transformations, perform competitively to their respective standard variants while also yielding explanations that are faithful by design. However, it has so far been necessary to train these models from scratch, which is increasingly infeasible in the era of large, pre-trained foundation models. In this work, inspired by the architectural similarities in standard DNNs and B-cos networks, we propose 'B-cosification', a novel approach to transform existing pre-trained models to become inherently interpretable. We perform a thorough study of design choices to perform this conversion, both for convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. We find that B-cosification can yield models that are on par with B-cos models trained from scratch in terms of interpretability, while often outperforming them in terms of classification performance at a fraction of the training cost. Subsequently, we apply B-cosification to a pretrained CLIP model, and show that, even with limited data and compute cost, we obtain a B-cosified version that is highly interpretable and competitive on zero shot performance across a variety of datasets.

Key findings suggest that, while other benchmark models can provide high precision in localized areas, the VibrantVS model has substantial advantages across a broad reach of ecoregions in the western United States with higher accuracy, higher precision, the ability to generate updated inference at a cadence of three years or less, and high spatial resolution. The VibrantVS model provides significant value for ecological monitoring and land management decisions, including for wildfire mitigation.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures | None |

Our approach builds on Neural Turing Machines and Token Turing Machines, which were applied to NLP and sequential visual understanding tasks. ViTTMs are designed for non-sequential computer vision tasks such as image classification and segmentation. Our model creates two sets of tokens: process tokens and memory tokens; process tokens pass through encoder blocks and read-write from memory tokens at each encoder block in the network, allowing them to store and retrieve information from memory. By ensuring that there are fewer process tokens than memory tokens, we are able to reduce the inference time of the network while maintaining its accuracy. On ImageNet-1K, the state-of-the-art ViT-B has median latency of 529.5ms and 81.0% accuracy, while our ViTTM-B is 56% faster (234.1ms), with 2.4 times fewer FLOPs, with an accuracy of 82.9%. On ADE20K semantic segmentation, ViT-B achieves 45.65mIoU at 13.8 frame-per-second (FPS) whereas our ViTTM-B model acheives a 45.17 mIoU with 26.8 FPS (+94%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> | None |

Recent advancements in deep learning offer a promising solution for predicting changes in AMD from optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal volumes. In this work, we proposed deep learning models for the two tasks of the public MARIO Challenge at MICCAI 2024, designed to detect and forecast changes in nAMD severity with longitudinal retinal OCT. For the first task, we employ a Vision Transformer (ViT) based Siamese Network to detect changes in AMD severity by comparing scan embeddings of a patient from different time points. To train a model to forecast the change after 3 months, we exploit, for the first time, an Earth Mover (Wasserstein) Distance-based loss to harness the ordinal relation within the severity change classes. Both models ranked high on the preliminary leaderboard, demonstrating that their predictive capabilities could facilitate nAMD treatment management.</p></details> | <details><summary>Solut...</summary><p>Solution to the MICCAI 2024 MARIO Challange.

In state-of-the-art architectures, the main challenge is to efficiently capture complex objects and fine-grained details, which are often difficult to predict. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based approach using an enhanced encoder-decoder architecture, where the Inception-ResNet-v2 model serves as the encoder. This is the first instance of utilizing Inception-ResNet-v2 as an encoder for monocular depth estimation, demonstrating improved performance over previous models. It incorporates multi-scale feature extraction to enhance depth prediction accuracy across various object sizes and distances. We propose a composite loss function comprising depth loss, gradient edge loss, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, with fine-tuned weights to optimize the weighted sum, ensuring a balance across different aspects of depth estimation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that our model achieves a significantly faster inference time of 0.019 seconds, outperforming vision transformers in efficiency while maintaining good accuracy. On the NYU Depth V2 dataset, the model establishes state-of-the-art performance, with an Absolute Relative Error (ARE) of 0.064, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.228, and an accuracy of 89.3% for $\delta$ < 1.25. These metrics demonstrate that our model can accurately and efficiently predict depth even in challenging scenarios, providing a practical solution for real-time applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Detecting and mitigating shortcut behavior is a challenging task that often requires significant labeling efforts from domain experts. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a semi-automated framework for the identification of spurious behavior from both data and model perspective by leveraging insights from eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). This allows the retrieval of spurious data points and the detection of model circuits that encode the associated prediction rules. Moreover, we demonstrate how these shortcut encodings can be used for XAI-based sample- and pixel-level data annotation, providing valuable information for bias mitigation methods to unlearn the undesired shortcut behavior. We show the applicability of our framework using four medical datasets across two modalities, featuring controlled and real-world spurious correlations caused by data artifacts. We successfully identify and mitigate these biases in VGG16, ResNet50, and contemporary Vision Transformer models, ultimately increasing their robustness and applicability for real-world medical tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This study explores the integration of crowdsourced labels with advanced artificial intelligence models to develop a fast and accurate kelp canopy detection pipeline using Landsat images. Building on the success of a machine learning competition, where this approach ranked third and performed consistently well on both local validation and public and private leaderboards, the research highlights the effectiveness of combining Mixed Vision Transformers (MIT) with ConvNeXt models. Training these models on various image sizes significantly enhanced the accuracy of the ensemble results. U-Net emerged as the best segmentation architecture, with UpperNet also contributing to the final ensemble. Key Landsat bands, such as ShortWave InfraRed (SWIR1) and Near-InfraRed (NIR), were crucial while altitude data was used in postprocessing to eliminate false positives on land. The methodology achieved a high detection rate, accurately identifying about three out of four pixels containing kelp canopy while keeping false positives low. Despite the medium resolution of Landsat satellites, their extensive historical coverage makes them effective for studying kelp forests. This work also underscores the potential of combining machine learning models with crowdsourced data for effective and scalable environmental monitoring.

While existing vision transformers demonstrate promising performance, they often utilize high-resolution context modeling, resulting in a computational bottleneck. In this work, we challenge conventional wisdom and introduce the Low-Resolution Self-Attention (LRSA) mechanism to capture global context at a significantly reduced computational cost, i.e., FLOPs. Our approach involves computing self-attention in a fixed low-resolution space regardless of the input image's resolution, with additional 3x3 depth-wise convolutions to capture fine details in the high-resolution space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our LRSA approach by building the LRFormer, a vision transformer with an encoder-decoder structure.

These wounds can take up to nine months to heal, making regular care essential to ensure healing and prevent severe outcomes like limb amputations. Many patients receive care at home from visiting nurses with varying levels of wound expertise, leading to inconsistent care. Problematic, non-healing wounds should be referred to wound specialists, but referral decisions in non-clinical settings are often erroneous, delayed, or unnecessary. This paper introduces the Deep Multimodal Wound Assessment Tool (DM-WAT), a machine learning framework designed to assist visiting nurses in deciding whether to refer chronic wound patients. DM-WAT analyzes smartphone-captured wound images and clinical notes from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). It uses DeiT-Base-Distilled, a Vision Transformer (ViT), to extract visual features from images and DeBERTa-base to extract text features from clinical notes. DM-WAT combines visual and text features using an intermediate fusion approach. To address challenges posed by a small and imbalanced dataset, it integrates image and text augmentation with transfer learning to achieve high performance. In evaluations, DM-WAT achieved 77% with std 3% accuracy and a 70% with std 2% F1 score, outperforming prior approaches. Score-CAM and Captum interpretation algorithms provide insights into specific parts of image and text inputs that influence recommendations, enhancing interpretability and trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.05051 by other authors</p></details> | None |

Both are designed to solve complex classification tasks but from different perspectives. This study demonstrates that CNNs and ViT architectures stem from a unified underlying learning mechanism, which quantitatively measures the single-nodal performance (SNP) of each node in feedforward (FF) and multi-head attention (MHA) subblocks. Each node identifies small clusters of possible output labels, with additional noise represented as labels outside these clusters. These features are progressively sharpened along the transformer encoders, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. This unified underlying learning mechanism leads to two main findings. First, it enables an efficient applied nodal diagonal connection (ANDC) pruning technique without affecting the accuracy. Second, based on the SNP, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs among the MHA heads, such that each head focuses its attention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. Consequently, each head becomes an expert in recognizing its designated labels, representing a quantitative MHA modus vivendi mechanism. These results are based on a compact convolutional transformer architecture trained on the CIFAR-100 and Flowers-102 datasets and call for their extension to other architectures and applications, such as natural language processing.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures | None |

In this context, recent approaches have employed the Masked Image Modeling paradigm, which pre-trains a backbone by reconstructing visual tokens associated with randomly masked image patches. This masking approach, however, introduces noise into the input data during pre-training, leading to discrepancies that can impair performance during the fine-tuning phase. Furthermore, input masking neglects the dependencies between corrupted patches, increasing the inconsistencies observed in downstream fine-tuning tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach, named Masked and Permuted Vision Transformer (MaPeT), that employs autoregressive and permuted predictions to capture intra-patch dependencies. In addition, MaPeT employs auxiliary positional information to reduce the disparity between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In our experiments, we employ a fair setting to ensure reliable and meaningful comparisons and conduct investigations on multiple visual tokenizers, including our proposed $k$-CLIP which directly employs discretized CLIP features. Our results demonstrate that MaPeT achieves competitive performance on ImageNet, compared to baselines and competitors under the same model setting.

In response, researchers have focused on developing AI-based scoring systems to provide real-time diagnostic support. However, the limited size and lack of proper annotation in publicly available ultrasound datasets pose significant challenges for training a robust AI model. This paper proposes MeDiVLAD, a novel pipeline to address the above issue for multi-level lung-ultrasound (LUS) severity scoring. In particular, we leverage self-knowledge distillation to pretrain a vision transformer (ViT) without label and aggregate frame-level features via dual-level VLAD aggregation. We show that with minimal finetuning, MeDiVLAD outperforms conventional fully-supervised methods in both frame- and video-level scoring, while offering classification reasoning with exceptional quality. This superior performance enables key applications such as the automatic identification of critical lung pathology areas and provides a robust solution for broader medical video classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISBI 2025</p></details> | None |

However, the manual generation of unstructured medical reports is time consuming and prone to errors. It creates a significant bottleneck in clinical workflows. Despite advancements in AI-generated radiology reports, challenges remain in achieving detailed and accurate report generation. In this study we have evaluated different combinations of multimodal models that integrate Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to generate comprehensive radiology reports. We employed a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) and a SWIN Transformer as the image encoders. The BART and GPT-2 models serve as the textual decoders.

A common belief is that this is attributed to the capability of self-attention in modeling the global dependencies among feature tokens. However, self-attention still faces several challenges in dense prediction tasks, including high computational complexity and absence of desirable inductive bias. To alleviate these issues, the potential advantages of combining vision transformers with Gabor filters are revisited, and a learnable Gabor filter (LGF) using convolution is proposed. The LGF does not rely on self-attention, and it is used to simulate the response of fundamental cells in the biological visual system to the input images. This encourages vision transformers to focus on discriminative feature representations of targets across different scales and orientations. In addition, a Bionic Focal Vision (BFV) block is designed based on the LGF. This block draws inspiration from neuroscience and introduces a Dual-Path Feed Forward Network (DPFFN) to emulate the parallel and cascaded information processing scheme of the biological visual cortex. Furthermore, a unified and efficient family of pyramid backbone networks called Focal Vision Transformers (FViTs) is developed by stacking BFV blocks. Experimental results indicate that FViTs demonstrate superior performance in various vision tasks. In terms of computational efficiency and scalability, FViTs show significant advantages compared with other counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to Elsevier for possible publication</p></details> | None |

The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.</p></details> |  | None |

As networks evolve towards Sixth Generation (6G) and semantic communication becomes increasingly central to next-generation wireless systems, securing semantic information transmission emerges as a critical challenge. While classical physical layer security (PLS) focuses on passive security, the recently proposed concept of physical layer deception (PLD) offers a semantic encryption measure to actively deceive eavesdroppers. Yet the existing studies of PLD have been dominantly information-theoretical and link-level oriented, lacking considerations of system-level design and practical implementation. In this work we propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled framework called Visual ENcryption for Eavesdropping NegAtion (VENENA), which combines the techniques of PLD, visual encryption, and image poisoning, into a comprehensive mechanism for deceptive secure semantic transmission in future wireless networks. By leveraging advanced vision transformers and semantic codecs, VENENA demonstrates how semantic security can be enhanced through the synergy of physical layer techniques and artificial intelligence, paving the way for secure semantic communication in 6G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE WCM</p></details> | None |

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

The approach is based on a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model of the training distribution in the classifier's latent space, enabling the formal characterization of OOD samples. Interestingly, under mild assumptions, the GEV model also allows for formally characterizing adversarial samples. The abstaining classifier, which rejects samples based on their assessment by the GEV model, provably avoids OOD and adversarial samples. The empirical validation of the approach, conducted on various neural architectures (ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformer) and medium and large-sized datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet), demonstrates its frugality, stability, and efficiency compared to the state of the art.</p></details> | under review | None |

However, real-world applications demand that models incrementally learn new information without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose past knowledge when adapting to new tasks, remains a critical issue. In this paper, we introduce IncSAR, an incremental learning framework designed to tackle catastrophic forgetting in SAR target recognition. IncSAR combines the power of a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a dual-branch architecture, integrated via a late-fusion strategy. Additionally, we explore the use of TinyViT to reduce computational complexity and propose an attention mechanism to dynamically enhance feature representation. To mitigate the speckle noise inherent in SAR images, we employ a denoising module based on a neural network approximation of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), leveraging a simple neural network for efficient noise reduction in SAR imagery. Moreover, a random projection layer improves the linear separability of features, and a variant of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) decorrelates extracted class prototypes for better generalization. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR, SAR-AIRcraft-1.0, and OpenSARShip benchmark datasets demonstrate that IncSAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 99.63\% average accuracy and a 0.33\% performance drop, representing an 89\% improvement in retention compared to existing techniques.

However, due to insufficient constraints on modeling such attention, we observe that the Localization Attention Maps (LAM) often struggle with the artifact issue, i.e., patch regions with minimal semantic relevance are falsely activated by class tokens. In this work, we propose MoRe to address this issue and further explore the potential of LAM. Our findings suggest that imposing additional regularization on class-patch attention is necessary. To this end, we first view the attention as a novel directed graph and propose the Graph Category Representation module to implicitly regularize the interaction among class-patch entities. It ensures that class tokens dynamically condense the related patch information and suppress unrelated artifacts at a graph level. Second, motivated by the observation that CAM from classification weights maintains smooth localization of objects, we devise the Localization-informed Regularization module to explicitly regularize the class-patch attention. It directly mines the token relations from CAM and further supervises the consistency between class and patch tokens in a learnable manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, validating that MoRe effectively addresses the artifact issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent single-stage and even multi-stage methods.

| **[Enhancing the Reliability in Machine Learning for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation with Attention-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10486v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased. This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are reliable and cases where they are not.</p></details> | 9 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Generalized Single-Image-Based Morphing Attack Detection Using Deep Representations from Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09817v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face morphing attacks have posed severe threats to Face Recognition Systems (FRS), which are operated in border control and passport issuance use cases. Correspondingly, morphing attack detection algorithms (MAD) are needed to defend against such attacks. MAD approaches must be robust enough to handle unknown attacks in an open-set scenario where attacks can originate from various morphing generation algorithms, post-processing and the diversity of printers/scanners. The problem of generalization is further pronounced when the detection has to be made on a single suspected image. In this paper, we propose a generalized single-image-based MAD (S-MAD) algorithm by learning the encoding from Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. Compared to CNN-based architectures, ViT model has the advantage on integrating local and global information and hence can be suitable to detect the morphing traces widely distributed among the face region. Extensive experiments are carried out on face morphing datasets generated using publicly available FRGC face datasets. Several state-of-the-art (SOTA) MAD algorithms, including representative ones that have been publicly evaluated, have been selected and benchmarked with our ViT-based approach. Obtained results demonstrate the improved detection performance of the proposed S-MAD method on inter-dataset testing (when different data is used for training and testing) and comparable performance on intra-dataset testing (when the same data is used for training and testing) experimental protocol.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SMPLest-X: Ultimate Scaling for Expressive Human Pose and Shape Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09782v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) unifies body, hands, and face motion capture with numerous applications. Despite encouraging progress, current state-of-the-art methods focus on training innovative architectural designs on confined datasets. In this work, we investigate the impact of scaling up EHPS towards a family of generalist foundation models. 1) For data scaling, we perform a systematic investigation on 40 EHPS datasets, encompassing a wide range of scenarios that a model trained on any single dataset cannot handle. More importantly, capitalizing on insights obtained from the extensive benchmarking process, we optimize our training scheme and select datasets that lead to a significant leap in EHPS capabilities. Ultimately, we achieve diminishing returns at 10M training instances from diverse data sources. 2) For model scaling, we take advantage of vision transformers (up to ViT-Huge as the backbone) to study the scaling law of model sizes in EHPS. To exclude the influence of algorithmic design, we base our experiments on two minimalist architectures: SMPLer-X, which consists of an intermediate step for hand and face localization, and SMPLest-X, an even simpler version that reduces the network to its bare essentials and highlights significant advances in the capture of articulated hands. With big data and the large model, the foundation models exhibit strong performance across diverse test benchmarks and excellent transferability to even unseen environments. Moreover, our finetuning strategy turns the generalist into specialist models, allowing them to achieve further performance boosts. Notably, our foundation models consistently deliver state-of-the-art results on seven benchmarks such as AGORA, UBody, EgoBody, and our proposed SynHand dataset for comprehensive hand evaluation.

| **[Learnings from Scaling Visual Tokenizers for Reconstruction and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09755v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tokenization via auto-encoding empowers state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space. Although scaling Transformer-based generators has been central to recent advances, the tokenizer component itself is rarely scaled, leaving open questions about how auto-encoder design choices influence both its objective of reconstruction and downstream generative performance. Our work aims to conduct an exploration of scaling in auto-encoders to fill in this blank. To facilitate this exploration, we replace the typical convolutional backbone with an enhanced Vision Transformer architecture for Tokenization (ViTok). We train ViTok on large-scale image and video datasets far exceeding ImageNet-1K, removing data constraints on tokenizer scaling. We first study how scaling the auto-encoder bottleneck affects both reconstruction and generation -- and find that while it is highly correlated with reconstruction, its relationship with generation is more complex. We next explored the effect of separately scaling the auto-encoders' encoder and decoder on reconstruction and generation performance. Crucially, we find that scaling the encoder yields minimal gains for either reconstruction or generation, while scaling the decoder boosts reconstruction but the benefits for generation are mixed. Building on our exploration, we design ViTok as a lightweight auto-encoder that achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art auto-encoders on ImageNet-1K and COCO reconstruction tasks (256p and 512p) while outperforming existing auto-encoders on 16-frame 128p video reconstruction for UCF-101, all with 2-5x fewer FLOPs. When integrated with Diffusion Transformers, ViTok demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks for class-conditional video generation on UCF-101.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 25 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Prompt-CAM: A Simpler Interpretable Transformer for Fine-Grained Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09333v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple usage of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for fine-grained analysis, aiming to identify and localize the traits that distinguish visually similar categories, such as different bird species or dog breeds. Pre-trained ViTs such as DINO have shown remarkable capabilities to extract localized, informative features. However, using saliency maps like Grad-CAM can hardly point out the traits: they often locate the whole object by a blurred, coarse heatmap, not traits. We propose a novel approach Prompt Class Attention Map (Prompt-CAM) to the rescue. Prompt-CAM learns class-specific prompts to a pre-trained ViT and uses the corresponding outputs for classification. To classify an image correctly, the true-class prompt must attend to the unique image patches not seen in other classes' images, i.e., traits. As such, the true class's multi-head attention maps reveal traits and their locations. Implementation-wise, Prompt-CAM is almost a free lunch by simply modifying the prediction head of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT). This makes Prompt-CAM fairly easy to train and apply, sharply contrasting other interpretable methods that design specific models and training processes. It is even simpler than the recently published INterpretable TRansformer (INTR), whose encoder-decoder architecture prevents it from leveraging pre-trained ViTs. Extensive empirical studies on a dozen datasets from various domains (e.g., birds, fishes, insects, fungi, flowers, food, and cars) validate Prompt-CAM superior interpretation capability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Self-Supervised Disturbance Mapping with the OPERA Sentinel-1 Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR Backscatter Product](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09129v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mapping land surface disturbances supports disaster response, resource and ecosystem management, and climate adaptation efforts. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an invaluable tool for disturbance mapping, providing consistent time-series images of the ground regardless of weather or illumination conditions. Despite SAR's potential for disturbance mapping, processing SAR data to an analysis-ready format requires expertise and significant compute resources, particularly for large-scale global analysis. In October 2023, NASA's Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project released the near-global Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR backscatter from Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) dataset, providing publicly available, analysis-ready SAR imagery. In this work, we utilize this new dataset to systematically analyze land surface disturbances. As labeling SAR data is often prohibitively time-consuming, we train a self-supervised vision transformer - which requires no labels to train - on OPERA RTC-S1 data to estimate a per-pixel distribution from the set of baseline imagery and assess disturbances when there is significant deviation from the modeled distribution. To test our model's capability and generality, we evaluate three different natural disasters - which represent high-intensity, abrupt disturbances - from three different regions of the world. Across events, our approach yields high quality delineations: F1 scores exceeding 0.6 and Areas Under the Precision-Recall Curve exceeding 0.65, consistently outperforming existing SAR disturbance methods. Our findings suggest that a self-supervised vision transformer is well-suited for global disturbance mapping and can be a valuable tool for operational, near-global disturbance monitoring, particularly when labeled data does not exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Self Pre-training with Adaptive Mask Autoencoders for Variable-Contrast 3D Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09096v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Masked Autoencoder (MAE) has recently demonstrated effectiveness in pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) for analyzing natural images. By reconstructing complete images from partially masked inputs, the ViT encoder gathers contextual information to predict the missing regions. This capability to aggregate context is especially important in medical imaging, where anatomical structures are functionally and mechanically linked to surrounding regions. However, current methods do not consider variations in the number of input images, which is typically the case in real-world Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies. To address this limitation, we propose a 3D Adaptive Masked Autoencoders (AMAE) architecture that accommodates a variable number of 3D input contrasts per subject. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of 45,364 subjects was used for pretraining and a subset of 1648 training, 193 validation and 215 test subjects were used for finetuning. The performance demonstrates that self pre-training of this adaptive masked autoencoders can enhance the infarct segmentation performance by 2.8%-3.7% for ViT-based segmentation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, ISBI 2025 accepted</p></details> | None |
| **[Feature-based One-For-All: A Universal Framework for Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08885v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) involves transferring knowledge from a pre-trained heavy teacher model to a lighter student model, thereby reducing the inference cost while maintaining comparable effectiveness. Prior KD techniques typically assume homogeneity between the teacher and student models. However, as technology advances, a wide variety of architectures have emerged, ranging from initial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Multi-Level Perceptrons (MLPs). Consequently, developing a universal KD framework compatible with any architecture has become an important research topic. In this paper, we introduce a feature-based one-for-all (FOFA) KD framework to enable feature distillation across diverse architecture. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we design prompt tuning blocks that incorporate student feedback, allowing teacher features to adapt to the student model's learning process. Second, we propose region-aware attention to mitigate the view mismatch problem between heterogeneous architecture. By leveraging these two modules, effective distillation of intermediate features can be achieved across heterogeneous architectures. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and COCO demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MIAFEx: An Attention-based Feature Extraction Method for Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08562v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature extraction techniques are crucial in medical image classification; however, classical feature extractors in addition to traditional machine learning classifiers often exhibit significant limitations in providing sufficient discriminative information for complex image sets. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output features quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating its superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex classification medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively.

| **[SuperSAM: Crafting a SAM Supernetwork via Structured Pruning and Unstructured Parameter Prioritization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08504v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful approach of automating the design of efficient neural architectures. In contrast to traditional NAS methods, recently proposed one-shot NAS methods prove to be more efficient in performing NAS. One-shot NAS works by generating a singular weight-sharing supernetwork that acts as a search space (container) of subnetworks. Despite its achievements, designing the one-shot search space remains a major challenge. In this work we propose a search space design strategy for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures. In particular, we convert the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a weight-sharing supernetwork called SuperSAM. Our approach involves automating the search space design via layer-wise structured pruning and parameter prioritization. While the structured pruning applies probabilistic removal of certain transformer layers, parameter prioritization performs weight reordering and slicing of MLP-blocks in the remaining layers. We train supernetworks on several datasets using the sandwich rule. For deployment, we enhance subnetwork discovery by utilizing a program autotuner to identify efficient subnetworks within the search space. The resulting subnetworks are 30-70% smaller in size compared to the original pre-trained SAM ViT-B, yet outperform the pretrained model. Our work introduces a new and effective method for ViT NAS search-space design.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling White-Box Transformers for Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20299v4)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CRATE, a white-box transformer architecture designed to learn compressed and sparse representations, offers an intriguing alternative to standard vision transformers (ViTs) due to its inherent mathematical interpretability. Despite extensive investigations into the scaling behaviors of language and vision transformers, the scalability of CRATE remains an open question which this paper aims to address. Specifically, we propose CRATE-$\alpha$, featuring strategic yet minimal modifications to the sparse coding block in the CRATE architecture design, and a light training recipe designed to improve the scalability of CRATE. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CRATE-$\alpha$ can effectively scale with larger model sizes and datasets. For example, our CRATE-$\alpha$-B substantially outperforms the prior best CRATE-B model accuracy on ImageNet classification by 3.7%, achieving an accuracy of 83.2%. Meanwhile, when scaling further, our CRATE-$\alpha$-L obtains an ImageNet classification accuracy of 85.1%. More notably, these model performance improvements are achieved while preserving, and potentially even enhancing the interpretability of learned CRATE models, as we demonstrate through showing that the learned token representations of increasingly larger trained CRATE-$\alpha$ models yield increasingly higher-quality unsupervised object segmentation of images.

| **[Efficient Deep Learning-based Forward Solvers for Brain Tumor Growth Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08226v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor, poses major challenges due to its poor prognosis and high morbidity rates. Partial differential equation-based models offer promising potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes by simulating patient-specific tumor behavior for improved radiotherapy planning. However, model calibration remains a bottleneck due to the high computational demands of optimization methods like Monte Carlo sampling and evolutionary algorithms. To address this, we recently introduced an approach leveraging a neural forward solver with gradient-based optimization to significantly reduce calibration time. This approach requires a highly accurate and fully differentiable forward model. We investigate multiple architectures, including (i) an enhanced TumorSurrogate, (ii) a modified nnU-Net, and (iii) a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT). The optimized TumorSurrogate achieved the best overall results, excelling in both tumor outline matching and voxel-level prediction of tumor cell concentration. It halved the MSE relative to the baseline model and achieved the highest Dice score across all tumor cell concentration thresholds. Our study demonstrates significant enhancement in forward solver performance and outlines important future research directions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, such success is largely fueled by training on massive samples. In real applications, the large-scale datasets are not always available, and ViT performs worse than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) if it is only trained on small scale dataset (called tiny dataset), since it requires large amount of training data to ensure its representational capacity. In this paper, a small-size ViT architecture with multi-scale self-attention mechanism and convolution blocks is presented (dubbed MSCViT) to model different scales of attention at each layer. Firstly, we introduced wavelet convolution, which selectively combines the high-frequency components obtained by frequency division with our convolution channel to extract local features. Then, a lightweight multi-head attention module is developed to reduce the number of tokens and computational costs. Finally, the positional encoding (PE) in the backbone is replaced by a local feature extraction module. Compared with the original ViT, it is parameter-efficient and is particularly suitable for tiny datasets. Extensive experiments have been conducted on tiny datasets, in which our model achieves an accuracy of 84.68% on CIFAR-100 with 14.0M parameters and 2.5 GFLOPs, without pre-training on large datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
