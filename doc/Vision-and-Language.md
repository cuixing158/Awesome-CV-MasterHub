| **[Liquid: Language Models are Scalable and Unified Multi-modal Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04332v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as Qwen2.5 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/FoundationVision/Liquid.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

| **[Your contrastive learning problem is secretly a distribution alignment problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20141v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of contrastive learning (CL) in vision and language, its theoretical foundations and mechanisms for building representations remain poorly understood. In this work, we build connections between noise contrastive estimation losses widely used in CL and distribution alignment with entropic optimal transport (OT). This connection allows us to develop a family of different losses and multistep iterative variants for existing CL methods. Intuitively, by using more information from the distribution of latents, our approach allows a more distribution-aware manipulation of the relationships within augmented sample sets. We provide theoretical insights and experimental evidence demonstrating the benefits of our approach for {\em generalized contrastive alignment}. Through this framework, it is possible to leverage tools in OT to build unbalanced losses to handle noisy views and customize the representation space by changing the constraints on alignment. By reframing contrastive learning as an alignment problem and leveraging existing optimization tools for OT, our work provides new insights and connections between different self-supervised learning models in addition to new tools that can be more easily adapted to incorporate domain knowledge into learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2024 submission, includes supplementary material</p></details> | None |
| **[Bag of Design Choices for Inference of High-Resolution Masked Generative Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10781v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) develop at an unprecedented pace, supported by thorough theoretical exploration and empirical analysis. Unfortunately, the discrepancy between DMs and autoregressive models (ARMs) complicates the path toward achieving the goal of unified vision and language generation. Recently, the masked generative Transformer (MGT) serves as a promising intermediary between DM and ARM by predicting randomly masked image tokens (i.e., masked image modeling), combining the efficiency of DM with the discrete token nature of ARM. However, we find that the comprehensive analyses regarding the inference for MGT are virtually non-existent, and thus we aim to present positive design choices to fill this gap. We propose and redesign a set of enhanced inference techniques tailored for MGT, providing a detailed analysis of their performance. Additionally, we explore several DM-based approaches aimed at accelerating the sampling process on MGT. Extensive experiments and empirical analyses on the recent SOTA MGT, such as MaskGIT and Meissonic lead to concrete and effective design choices, and these design choices can be merged to achieve further performance gains. For instance, in terms of enhanced inference, we achieve winning rates of approximately 70% compared to vanilla sampling on HPS v2 with Meissonic-1024x1024.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generalist World Model Pre-Training for Efficient Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19544v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample-efficient robot learning is a longstanding goal in robotics. Inspired by the success of scaling in vision and language, the robotics community is now investigating large-scale offline datasets for robot learning. However, existing methods often require expert and/or reward-labeled task-specific data, which can be costly and limit their application in practice. In this paper, we consider a more realistic setting where the offline data consists of reward-free and non-expert multi-embodiment offline data. We show that generalist world model pre-training (WPT), together with retrieval-based experience rehearsal and execution guidance, enables efficient reinforcement learning (RL) and fast task adaptation with such non-curated data. In experiments over 72 visuomotor tasks, spanning 6 different embodiments, covering hard exploration, complex dynamics, and various visual properties, WPT achieves 35.65% and 35% higher aggregated score compared to widely used learning-from-scratch baselines, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Ground-level Viewpoint Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19024v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) empowers agents to associate time-sequenced visual observations with corresponding instructions to make sequential decisions. However, generalization remains a persistent challenge, particularly when dealing with visually diverse scenes or transitioning from simulated environments to real-world deployment. In this paper, we address the mismatch between human-centric instructions and quadruped robots with a low-height field of view, proposing a Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav) approach to mitigate this issue. This work represents the first attempt to highlight the generalization gap in VLN across varying heights of visual observation in realistic robot deployments. Our approach leverages weighted historical observations as enriched spatiotemporal contexts for instruction following, effectively managing feature collisions within cells by assigning appropriate weights to identical features across different viewpoints. This enables low-height robots to overcome challenges such as visual obstructions and perceptual mismatches. Additionally, we transfer the connectivity graph from the HM3D and Gibson datasets as an extra resource to enhance spatial priors and a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and generalizability of the waypoint predictor in real-world environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVnav) approach significantly improves performance in both simulated environments and real-world deployments with quadruped robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Semantic Equivalence of Tokenization in Multimodal LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05127v4)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in processing vision-language tasks. One of the crux of MLLMs lies in vision tokenization, which involves efficiently transforming input visual signals into feature representations that are most beneficial for LLMs. However, existing vision tokenizers, essential for semantic alignment between vision and language, remain problematic. Existing methods aggressively fragment visual input, corrupting the visual semantic integrity. To address this, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Semantic-Equivalent Vision Tokenizer (SeTok), which groups visual features into semantic units via a dynamic clustering algorithm, flexibly determining the number of tokens based on image complexity. The resulting vision tokens effectively preserve semantic integrity and capture both low-frequency and high-frequency visual features. The proposed MLLM (Setokim) equipped with SeTok significantly demonstrates superior performance across various tasks, as evidenced by our experimental results.

| **[Gnothi Seauton: Empowering Faithful Self-Interpretability in Black-Box Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21815v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The debate between self-interpretable models and post-hoc explanations for black-box models is central to Explainable AI (XAI). Self-interpretable models, such as concept-based networks, offer insights by connecting decisions to human-understandable concepts but often struggle with performance and scalability. Conversely, post-hoc methods like Shapley values, while theoretically robust, are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. To bridge the gap between these two lines of research, we propose a novel method that combines their strengths, providing theoretically guaranteed self-interpretability for black-box models without compromising prediction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce a parameter-efficient pipeline, AutoGnothi, which integrates a small side network into the black-box model, allowing it to generate Shapley value explanations without changing the original network parameters. This side-tuning approach significantly reduces memory, training, and inference costs, outperforming traditional parameter-efficient methods, where full fine-tuning serves as the optimal baseline. AutoGnothi enables the black-box model to predict and explain its predictions with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments show that AutoGnothi offers accurate explanations for both vision and language tasks, delivering superior computational efficiency with comparable interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, 29 pages, 13 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[SwimVG: Step-wise Multimodal Fusion and Adaption for Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16786v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding aims to ground an image region through natural language, which heavily relies on cross-modal alignment. Most existing methods transfer visual/linguistic knowledge separately by fully fine-tuning uni-modal pre-trained models, followed by a simple stack of visual-language transformers for multimodal fusion. However, these approaches not only limit adequate interaction between visual and linguistic contexts, but also incur significant computational costs. Therefore, to address these issues, we explore a step-wise multimodal fusion and adaption framework, namely SwimVG. Specifically, SwimVG proposes step-wise multimodal prompts (Swip) and cross-modal interactive adapters (CIA) for visual grounding, replacing the cumbersome transformer stacks for multimodal fusion. Swip can improve {the} alignment between the vision and language representations step by step, in a token-level fusion manner. In addition, weight-level CIA further promotes multimodal fusion by cross-modal interaction. Swip and CIA are both parameter-efficient paradigms, and they fuse the cross-modal features from shallow to deep layers gradually. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that SwimVG achieves remarkable abilities and considerable benefits in terms of efficiency.

| **[Cross-domain Multi-modal Few-shot Object Detection via Rich Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16188v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-modal feature extraction and integration have led to steady performance improvements in few-shot learning tasks due to generating richer features. However, existing multi-modal object detection (MM-OD) methods degrade when facing significant domain-shift and are sample insufficient. We hypothesize that rich text information could more effectively help the model to build a knowledge relationship between the vision instance and its language description and can help mitigate domain shift. Specifically, we study the Cross-Domain few-shot generalization of MM-OD (CDMM-FSOD) and propose a meta-learning based multi-modal few-shot object detection method that utilizes rich text semantic information as an auxiliary modality to achieve domain adaptation in the context of FSOD. Our proposed network contains (i) a multi-modal feature aggregation module that aligns the vision and language support feature embeddings and (ii) a rich text semantic rectify module that utilizes bidirectional text feature generation to reinforce multi-modal feature alignment and thus to enhance the model's language understanding capability. We evaluate our model on common standard cross-domain object detection datasets and demonstrate that our approach considerably outperforms existing FSOD methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BottleHumor: Self-Informed Humor Explanation using the Information Bottleneck Principle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18331v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humor is prevalent in online communications and it often relies on more than one modality (e.g., cartoons and memes). Interpreting humor in multimodal settings requires drawing on diverse types of knowledge, including metaphorical, sociocultural, and commonsense knowledge. However, identifying the most useful knowledge remains an open question. We introduce \method{}, a method inspired by the information bottleneck principle that elicits relevant world knowledge from vision and language models which is iteratively refined for generating an explanation of the humor in an unsupervised manner. Our experiments on three datasets confirm the advantage of our method over a range of baselines. Our method can further be adapted in the future for additional tasks that can benefit from eliciting and conditioning on relevant world knowledge and open new research avenues in this direction.</p></details> |  | None |
