| **[Grounded Knowledge-Enhanced Medical Vision-Language Pre-training for Chest X-Ray](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14750v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing robust and generalized representations of medical data. Medical vision-language pre-training has emerged as a promising approach for learning domain-general representations of medical image and text. Current algorithms that exploit global and local alignment between medical image and text could however be marred by redundant information in medical data. To address this issue, we propose a grounded knowledge-enhanced medical vision-language pre-training (GK-MVLP) framework for chest X-ray. In this framework, medical knowledge was grounded to the appropriate anatomical regions by using a transformer-based grounded knowledge-enhanced module for fine-grained alignment between textural features of medical knowledge and the corresponding anatomical region-level visual features. The performance of GK-MVLP was competitive with or exceeded the state of the art on downstream image understanding tasks (chest X-ray disease classification, disease localization), generative task (report generation), and vision-language understanding task (medical visual question-answering). Our results demonstrate the advantage of incorporating grounding mechanism to remove biases and improve the alignment between chest X-ray image and radiology report.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VP-MEL: Visual Prompts Guided Multimodal Entity Linking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06720v4)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal entity linking (MEL), a task aimed at linking mentions within multimodal contexts to their corresponding entities in a knowledge base (KB), has attracted much attention due to its wide applications in recent years. However, existing MEL methods often rely on mention words as retrieval cues, which limits their ability to effectively utilize information from both images and text. This reliance causes MEL to struggle with accurately retrieving entities in certain scenarios, especially when the focus is on image objects or mention words are missing from the text. To solve these issues, we introduce a Visual Prompts guided Multimodal Entity Linking (VP-MEL) task. Given a text-image pair, VP-MEL aims to link a marked region (i.e., visual prompt) in an image to its corresponding entities in the knowledge base. To facilitate this task, we present a new dataset, VPWiki, specifically designed for VP-MEL. Furthermore, we propose a framework named IIER, which enhances visual feature extraction using visual prompts and leverages the pretrained Detective-VLM model to capture latent information. Experimental results on the VPWiki dataset demonstrate that IIER outperforms baseline methods across multiple benchmarks for the VP-MEL task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[REGNav: Room Expert Guided Image-Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10785v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-goal navigation aims to steer an agent towards the goal location specified by an image. Most prior methods tackle this task by learning a navigation policy, which extracts visual features of goal and observation images, compares their similarity and predicts actions. However, if the agent is in a different room from the goal image, it's extremely challenging to identify their similarity and infer the likely goal location, which may result in the agent wandering around. Intuitively, when humans carry out this task, they may roughly compare the current observation with the goal image, having an approximate concept of whether they are in the same room before executing the actions. Inspired by this intuition, we try to imitate human behaviour and propose a Room Expert Guided Image-Goal Navigation model (REGNav) to equip the agent with the ability to analyze whether goal and observation images are taken in the same room. Specifically, we first pre-train a room expert with an unsupervised learning technique on the self-collected unlabelled room images. The expert can extract the hidden room style information of goal and observation images and predict their relationship about whether they belong to the same room. In addition, two different fusion approaches are explored to efficiently guide the agent navigation with the room relation knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our REGNav surpasses prior state-of-the-art works on three popular benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 Oral</p></details> | None |
| **[HelmetPoser: A Helmet-Mounted IMU Dataset for Data-Driven Estimation of Human Head Motion in Diverse Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05006v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Helmet-mounted wearable positioning systems are crucial for enhancing safety and facilitating coordination in industrial, construction, and emergency rescue environments. These systems, including LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), often face challenges in localization due to adverse environmental conditions such as dust, smoke, and limited visual features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel head-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset with ground truth, aimed at advancing data-driven IMU pose estimation. Our dataset captures human head motion patterns using a helmet-mounted system, with data from ten participants performing various activities. We explore the application of neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to correct IMU biases and improve localization accuracy. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of these methods across different IMU data window dimensions, motion patterns, and sensor types. We release a publicly available dataset, demonstrate the feasibility of advanced neural network approaches for helmet-based localization, and provide evaluation metrics to establish a baseline for future studies in this field.

| **[Locate Anything on Earth: Advancing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection for Remote Sensing Community](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09110v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection, particularly open-vocabulary object detection, plays a crucial role in Earth sciences, such as environmental monitoring, natural disaster assessment, and land-use planning. However, existing open-vocabulary detectors, primarily trained on natural-world images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing images due to a significant data domain gap. Thus, this paper aims to advance the development of open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing community. To achieve this, we first reformulate the task as Locate Anything on Earth (LAE) with the goal of detecting any novel concepts on Earth. We then developed the LAE-Label Engine which collects, auto-annotates, and unifies up to 10 remote sensing datasets creating the LAE-1M - the first large-scale remote sensing object detection dataset with broad category coverage. Using the LAE-1M, we further propose and train the novel LAE-DINO Model, the first open-vocabulary foundation object detector for the LAE task, featuring Dynamic Vocabulary Construction (DVC) and Visual-Guided Text Prompt Learning (VisGT) modules. DVC dynamically constructs vocabulary for each training batch, while VisGT maps visual features to semantic space, enhancing text features. We comprehensively conduct experiments on established remote sensing benchmark DIOR, DOTAv2.0, as well as our newly introduced 80-class LAE-80C benchmark. Results demonstrate the advantages of the LAE-1M dataset and the effectiveness of the LAE-DINO method.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[MonoDETR: Depth-guided Transformer for Monocular 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13310v5)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D object detection has long been a challenging task in autonomous driving. Most existing methods follow conventional 2D detectors to first localize object centers, and then predict 3D attributes by neighboring features. However, only using local visual features is insufficient to understand the scene-level 3D spatial structures and ignores the long-range inter-object depth relations. In this paper, we introduce the first DETR framework for Monocular DEtection with a depth-guided TRansformer, named MonoDETR. We modify the vanilla transformer to be depth-aware and guide the whole detection process by contextual depth cues. Specifically, concurrent to the visual encoder that captures object appearances, we introduce to predict a foreground depth map, and specialize a depth encoder to extract non-local depth embeddings. Then, we formulate 3D object candidates as learnable queries and propose a depth-guided decoder to conduct object-scene depth interactions. In this way, each object query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the depth-guided regions on the image and is no longer constrained to local visual features. On KITTI benchmark with monocular images as input, MonoDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires no extra dense depth annotations. Besides, our depth-guided modules can also be plug-and-play to enhance multi-view 3D object detectors on nuScenes dataset, demonstrating our superior generalization capacity.

| **[Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural Radiance Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07916v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential in modeling 3D scenes. Dynamic NeRFs extend this model by capturing time-varying elements, typically using deformation fields. The existing dynamic NeRFs employ a similar Eulerian representation for both light radiance and deformation fields. This leads to a close coupling of appearance and motion and lacks a physical interpretation. In this work, we propose Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural Radiance Field (DAP-NeRF), which introduces particle-based representation to model the motions of visual elements in a dynamic 3D scene. DAP-NeRF consists of the superposition of a static field and a dynamic field. The dynamic field is quantized as a collection of appearance particles, which carries the visual information of a small dynamic element in the scene and is equipped with a motion model. All components, including the static field, the visual features and the motion models of particles, are learned from monocular videos without any prior geometric knowledge of the scene. We develop an efficient computational framework for the particle-based model. We also construct a new dataset to evaluate motion modeling. Experimental results show that DAP-NeRF is an effective technique to capture not only the appearance but also the physically meaningful motions in a 3D dynamic scene. Code is available at: https://github.com/Cenbylin/DAP-NeRF.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Cenbylin/DAP-NeRF) |
| **[DeepVL: Dynamics and Inertial Measurements-based Deep Velocity Learning for Underwater Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07726v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a learned model to predict the robot-centric velocity of an underwater robot through dynamics-aware proprioception. The method exploits a recurrent neural network using as inputs inertial cues, motor commands, and battery voltage readings alongside the hidden state of the previous time-step to output robust velocity estimates and their associated uncertainty. An ensemble of networks is utilized to enhance the velocity and uncertainty predictions. Fusing the network's outputs into an Extended Kalman Filter, alongside inertial predictions and barometer updates, the method enables long-term underwater odometry without further exteroception. Furthermore, when integrated into visual-inertial odometry, the method assists in enhanced estimation resilience when dealing with an order of magnitude fewer total features tracked (as few as 1) as compared to conventional visual-inertial systems. Tested onboard an underwater robot deployed both in a laboratory pool and the Trondheim Fjord, the method takes less than 5ms for inference either on the CPU or the GPU of an NVIDIA Orin AGX and demonstrates less than 4% relative position error in novel trajectories during complete visual blackout, and approximately 2% relative error when a maximum of 2 visual features from a monocular camera are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025), Atlanta, USA</p></details> | None |
| **[MGPATH: Vision-Language Model with Multi-Granular Prompt Learning for Few-Shot WSI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07409v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p></details> | first version | None |
| **[ZeroDiff: Solidified Visual-Semantic Correlation in Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02929v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) aims to enable classifiers to identify unseen classes. This is typically achieved by generating visual features for unseen classes based on learned visual-semantic correlations from seen classes. However, most current generative approaches heavily rely on having a sufficient number of samples from seen classes. Our study reveals that a scarcity of seen class samples results in a marked decrease in performance across many generative ZSL techniques. We argue, quantify, and empirically demonstrate that this decline is largely attributable to spurious visual-semantic correlations. To address this issue, we introduce ZeroDiff, an innovative generative framework for ZSL that incorporates diffusion mechanisms and contrastive representations to enhance visual-semantic correlations. ZeroDiff comprises three key components: (1) Diffusion augmentation, which naturally transforms limited data into an expanded set of noised data to mitigate generative model overfitting; (2) Supervised-contrastive (SC)-based representations that dynamically characterize each limited sample to support visual feature generation; and (3) Multiple feature discriminators employing a Wasserstein-distance-based mutual learning approach, evaluating generated features from various perspectives, including pre-defined semantics, SC-based representations, and the diffusion process. Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that ZeroDiff not only achieves significant improvements over existing ZSL methods but also maintains robust performance even with scarce training data.

| **[Sparse Autoencoders for Scientifically Rigorous Interpretation of Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06755v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To truly understand vision models, we must not only interpret their learned features but also validate these interpretations through controlled experiments. Current approaches either provide interpretable features without the ability to test their causal influence, or enable model editing without interpretable controls. We present a unified framework using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that bridges this gap, allowing us to discover human-interpretable visual features and precisely manipulate them to test hypotheses about model behavior. By applying our method to state-of-the-art vision models, we reveal key differences in the semantic abstractions learned by models with different pre-training objectives. We then demonstrate the practical usage of our framework through controlled interventions across multiple vision tasks. We show that SAEs can reliably identify and manipulate interpretable visual features without model re-training, providing a powerful tool for understanding and controlling vision model behavior. We provide code, demos and models on our project website: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SAE-V.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text is 11 pages with 7 figures</p></details> | [Code Link](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SAE-V) |

This paper presents Thought2Text, which uses instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with EEG data to achieve this goal. The approach involves three stages: (1) training an EEG encoder for visual feature extraction, (2) fine-tuning LLMs on image and text data, enabling multimodal description generation, and (3) further fine-tuning on EEG embeddings to generate text directly from EEG during inference. Experiments on a public EEG dataset collected for six subjects with image stimuli and text captions demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal LLMs (LLaMA-v3, Mistral-v0.3, Qwen2.5), validated using traditional language generation evaluation metrics, as well as fluency and adequacy measures. This approach marks a significant advancement towards portable, low-cost "thoughts-to-text" technology with potential applications in both neuroscience and natural language processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of NAACL 2025</p></details> | None |

Here, we tackle the specific task of sound-prompted segmentation, aiming to segment image regions corresponding to objects heard in an audio signal. Most existing approaches tackle this problem by fine-tuning pre-trained models or by training additional modules specifically for the task. We adopt a different strategy: we introduce a training-free approach that leverages Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to co-factorize audio and visual features from pre-trained models so as to reveal shared interpretable concepts. These concepts are passed on to an open-vocabulary segmentation model for precise segmentation maps. By using frozen pre-trained models, our method achieves high generalization and establishes state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised sound-prompted segmentation, significantly surpassing previous unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Image-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05815v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease is an untreatable, progressive brain disorder that slowly robs people of their memory, thinking abilities, and ultimately their capacity to complete even the most basic tasks. Among older adults, it is the most frequent cause of dementia. Although there is presently no treatment for Alzheimer's disease, scientific trials are ongoing to discover drugs to combat the condition. Treatments to slow the signs of dementia are also available. Many researchers throughout the world became interested in developing computer-aided diagnosis systems to aid in the early identification of this deadly disease and assure an accurate diagnosis. In particular, image based approaches have been coupled with machine learning techniques to address the challenges of Alzheimer's disease detection. This study proposes a computer aided diagnosis system to detect Alzheimer's disease from biomarkers captured using neuroimaging techniques. The proposed approach relies on deep learning techniques to extract the relevant visual features from the image collection to accurately predict the Alzheimer's class value. In the experiments, standard datasets and pre-trained deep learning models were investigated. Moreover, standard performance measures were used to assess the models' performances. The obtained results proved that VGG16-based models outperform the state of the art performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HoVLE: Unleashing the Power of Monolithic Vision-Language Models with Holistic Vision-Language Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16158v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Monolithic VLMs, which avoid modality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional ones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic VLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may degrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper presents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs have been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are aligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs actually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and language inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that converts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to process images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training strategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is first trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and text embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired random images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token prediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an instruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE achieves performance close to leading compositional models on various benchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

| **[Self-Supervised Learning for Pre-training Capsule Networks: Overcoming Medical Imaging Dataset Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04748v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning techniques are increasingly being adopted in diagnostic medical imaging. However, the limited availability of high-quality, large-scale medical datasets presents a significant challenge, often necessitating the use of transfer learning approaches. This study investigates self-supervised learning methods for pre-training capsule networks in polyp diagnostics for colon cancer. We used the PICCOLO dataset, comprising 3,433 samples, which exemplifies typical challenges in medical datasets: small size, class imbalance, and distribution shifts between data splits. Capsule networks offer inherent interpretability due to their architecture and inter-layer information routing mechanism. However, their limited native implementation in mainstream deep learning frameworks and the lack of pre-trained versions pose a significant challenge. This is particularly true if aiming to train them on small medical datasets, where leveraging pre-trained weights as initial parameters would be beneficial. We explored two auxiliary self-supervised learning tasks, colourisation and contrastive learning, for capsule network pre-training. We compared self-supervised pre-trained models against alternative initialisation strategies. Our findings suggest that contrastive learning and in-painting techniques are suitable auxiliary tasks for self-supervised learning in the medical domain. These techniques helped guide the model to capture important visual features that are beneficial for the downstream task of polyp classification, increasing its accuracy by 5.26% compared to other weight initialisation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In response, this study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Autonomous Driving (AD) assistance system that integrates a vision adapter and an LLM reasoning module to enhance visual understanding and decision-making. The vision adapter, combining YOLOv4 and Vision Transformer (ViT), extracts comprehensive visual features, while GPT-4 enables human-like spatial reasoning and response generation. Experimental evaluations with 45 experienced drivers revealed that the system closely mirrors human performance in describing situations and moderately aligns with human decisions in generating appropriate responses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Control-oriented Clustering of Visual Latent Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05063v4)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space -- the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder -- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of neural collapse (NC) in image classification (arXiv:2008.08186), we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar law of clustering in the visual representation space. Specifically, in discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels; in continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to "control-oriented" classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO). Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35%. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/ControlOriented_NC</p></details> | None |
| **[SAISA: Towards Multimodal Large Language Models with Both Training and Inference Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02458v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly fall into two architectures, each involving a trade-off between training and inference efficiency: embedding space alignment (e.g., LLaVA-1.5) is inefficient during inference, while cross-attention space alignment (e.g., Flamingo) is inefficient in training. In this paper, we compare these two architectures and identify the key factors for building efficient MLLMs. A primary difference between them lies in how attention is applied to visual tokens, particularly in their interactions with each other. To investigate whether attention among visual tokens is necessary, we propose a new self-attention mechanism, NAAViT (\textbf{N}o \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{A}mong \textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{T}okens), which eliminates this type of attention. Our pilot experiment on LLaVA-1.5 shows that attention among visual tokens is highly redundant. Based on these insights, we introduce SAISA (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{I}nput \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}lignment), a novel architecture that enhance both training and inference efficiency. SAISA directly aligns visual features with the input spaces of NAAViT self-attention blocks, reducing computational overhead in both self-attention blocks and feed-forward networks (FFNs). Using the same configuration as LLaVA-1.5, SAISA reduces inference FLOPs by 66\% and training budget by 26\%, while achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SAISA across various LLMs and visual encoders. The code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/SAISA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/icip-cas/SAISA) |
| **[InterLCM: Low-Quality Images as Intermediate States of Latent Consistency Models for Effective Blind Face Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02215v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion priors have been used for blind face restoration (BFR) by fine-tuning diffusion models (DMs) on restoration datasets to recover low-quality images. However, the naive application of DMs presents several key limitations. (i) The diffusion prior has inferior semantic consistency (e.g., ID, structure and color.), increasing the difficulty of optimizing the BFR model; (ii) reliance on hundreds of denoising iterations, preventing the effective cooperation with perceptual losses, which is crucial for faithful restoration. Observing that the latent consistency model (LCM) learns consistency noise-to-data mappings on the ODE-trajectory and therefore shows more semantic consistency in the subject identity, structural information and color preservation, we propose InterLCM to leverage the LCM for its superior semantic consistency and efficiency to counter the above issues. Treating low-quality images as the intermediate state of LCM, InterLCM achieves a balance between fidelity and quality by starting from earlier LCM steps. LCM also allows the integration of perceptual loss during training, leading to improved restoration quality, particularly in real-world scenarios. To mitigate structural and semantic uncertainties, InterLCM incorporates a Visual Module to extract visual features and a Spatial Encoder to capture spatial details, enhancing the fidelity of restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterLCM outperforms existing approaches in both synthetic and real-world datasets while also achieving faster inference speed.</p></details> | Accepted at ICLR2025 | None |
| **[Robust-LLaVA: On the Effectiveness of Large-Scale Robust Image Encoders for Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01576v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but remain vulnerable to visual adversarial perturbations that can induce hallucinations, manipulate responses, or bypass safety mechanisms. Existing methods seek to mitigate these risks by applying constrained adversarial fine-tuning to CLIP vision encoders on ImageNet-scale data, ensuring their generalization ability is preserved. However, this limited adversarial training restricts robustness and broader generalization. In this work, we explore an alternative approach of leveraging existing vision classification models that have been adversarially pre-trained on large-scale data. Our analysis reveals two principal contributions: (1) the extensive scale and diversity of adversarial pre-training enables these models to demonstrate superior robustness against diverse adversarial threats, ranging from imperceptible perturbations to advanced jailbreaking attempts, without requiring additional adversarial training, and (2) end-to-end MLLM integration with these robust models facilitates enhanced adaptation of language components to robust visual features, outperforming existing plug-and-play methodologies on complex reasoning tasks. Through systematic evaluation across visual question-answering, image captioning, and jail-break attacks, we demonstrate that MLLMs trained with these robust models achieve superior adversarial robustness while maintaining favorable clean performance. Our framework achieves 2x and 1.5x average robustness gains in captioning and VQA tasks, respectively, and delivers over 10% improvement against jailbreak attacks.

This paper introduces VideoRAG, the first retrieval-augmented generation framework specifically designed for processing and understanding extremely long-context videos. Our core innovation lies in its dual-channel architecture that seamlessly integrates (i) graph-based textual knowledge grounding for capturing cross-video semantic relationships, and (ii) multi-modal context encoding for efficiently preserving visual features. This novel design empowers VideoRAG to process unlimited-length videos by constructing precise knowledge graphs that span multiple videos while maintaining semantic dependencies through specialized multi-modal retrieval paradigms.

| **[AlignVLM: Bridging Vision and Language Latent Spaces for Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01341v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning visual features with language embeddings is a key challenge in vision-language models (VLMs). The performance of such models hinges on having a good connector that maps visual features generated by a vision encoder to a shared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity. Existing connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), often produce out-of-distribution or noisy inputs, leading to misalignment between the modalities. In this work, we propose a novel vision-text alignment method, AlignVLM, that maps visual features to a weighted average of LLM text embeddings. Our approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to ensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can effectively interpret. AlignVLM is particularly effective for document understanding tasks, where scanned document images must be accurately mapped to their textual content. Our extensive experiments show that AlignVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods. We provide further analysis demonstrating improved vision-text feature alignment and robustness to noise.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging this multi-modal information effectively for VAD poses a significant challenge, as the model must identify action-relevant cues with precision. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-modal VAD architecture, referred to as the Joint Actor-centric Visual, Audio, Language Encoder (JoVALE). JoVALE is the first VAD method to integrate audio and visual features with scene descriptive context sourced from large-capacity image captioning models. At the heart of JoVALE is the actor-centric aggregation of audio, visual, and scene descriptive information, enabling adaptive integration of crucial features for recognizing each actor's actions. We have developed a Transformer-based architecture, the Actor-centric Multi-modal Fusion Network, specifically designed to capture the dynamic interactions among actors and their multi-modal contexts. Our evaluation on three prominent VAD benchmarks, including AVA, UCF101-24, and JHMDB51-21, demonstrates that incorporating multi-modal information significantly enhances performance, setting new state-of-the-art performances in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025, 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> | None |

For visual feature extraction, Dlib is used to detect facial landmarks, while OpenCV provides additional estimations. The face recognition library, built on Dlib, is used to identify the facial region of interest specifically for physiological signal extraction. Physiological signals are then extracted using the plane-orthogonal-toskin method to assess cardiovascular activity. These features are integrated using advanced machine learning classifiers, enhancing the detection of various levels of engagement. We thoroughly tested VisioPhysioENet on the DAiSEE dataset.

In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2025)</p></details> | None |

To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images one at a time, and they must identify when the current item matches the item presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features that result in the least and most memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in cognitive science and computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to perform real-time ego-motion tracking for endoscope. Firstly, a multi-modal visual feature learning network is proposed to perform relative pose prediction, in which the motion feature from the optical flow, the scene features and the joint feature from two adjacent observations are all extracted for prediction. Due to more correlation information in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature extractor is designed based on an attention mechanism to integrate multi-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames. To extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a novel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the concatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute pose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is conducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per second, which meets the real-time requirement.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing research often focuses on connecting visual features with specific class text in downstream tasks, overlooking the latent relationships between general and specialized knowledge. Our findings reveal that forcing models to optimize inappropriate visual-text matches exacerbates forgetting of VLMs. To tackle this issue, we propose DesCLIP, which leverages general attribute (GA) descriptions to guide the understanding of specific class objects, enabling VLMs to establish robust \textit{vision-GA-class} trilateral associations rather than relying solely on \textit{vision-class} connections. Specifically, we introduce a language assistant to generate concrete GA description candidates via proper request prompts. Then, an anchor-based embedding filter is designed to obtain highly relevant GA description embeddings, which are leveraged as the paired text embeddings for visual-textual instance matching, thereby tuning the visual encoder. Correspondingly, the class text embeddings are gradually calibrated to align with these shared GA description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancements and efficacy of our proposed method, with comprehensive empirical evaluations highlighting its superior performance compared to existing pretrained and VLM-based continual learning methods.</p></details> |  | None |

A Deep Learning-based Adaptation Mechanism (DLAM) is proposed to adaptively tune the noise covariance matrices of Kalman-type filters for the Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem, leveraging IMU-Vision-Net. Subsequently, an adaptively tuned Deep Learning Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D VIN (DeepUKF-VIN) is introduced to utilize the proposed DLAM, thereby robustly estimating key navigation components, including orientation, position, and linear velocity. The proposed DeepUKF-VIN integrates data from onboard sensors, specifically an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual feature points extracted from a camera, and is applicable for GPS-denied navigation. Its quaternion-based design effectively captures navigation nonlinearities and avoids the singularities commonly encountered with Euler-angle-based filters. Implemented in discrete space, the DeepUKF-VIN facilitates practical filter deployment. The filter's performance is evaluated using real-world data collected from an IMU and a stereo camera at low sampling rates. The results demonstrate filter stability and rapid attenuation of estimation errors, highlighting its high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, comparative testing against the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in two scenarios consistently shows superior performance across all navigation components, thereby validating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed DeepUKF-VIN.

This study addresses the challenges of emotion recognition by integrating facial expression analysis with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, introducing a novel multimodal framework-Milmer. The proposed framework employs a transformer-based fusion approach to effectively integrate visual and physiological modalities. It consists of an EEG preprocessing module, a facial feature extraction and balancing module, and a cross-modal fusion module. To enhance visual feature extraction, we fine-tune a pre-trained Swin Transformer on emotion-related datasets. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism is introduced to balance token representation across modalities, ensuring effective feature integration. A key innovation of this work is the adoption of a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, which extracts meaningful information from multiple facial expression images over time, capturing critical temporal dynamics often overlooked in previous studies. Extensive experiments conducted on the DEAP dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.72% in the four-class emotion recognition task. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of each module, highlighting the significance of advanced feature extraction and fusion strategies in enhancing emotion recognition performance.

Generative models, particularly Stable Diffusion, have shown remarkable potential in recovering fine details and reconstructing missing regions through large-scale training on diverse datasets. However, models like CLIP, which rely on textual embeddings, face limitations in complex outdoor environments where rich context information is needed. These limitations reduce their effectiveness in such challenging scenarios.

Evaluated on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models while addressing the shortcomings of CLIP embeddings in handling outdoor scenes. By leveraging visual semantics directly, our method demonstrates enhanced robustness and adaptability in depth estimation tasks, showcasing its potential for application to other visual perception tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, which often suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and rely on multi-stage object detection pipelines, this study employs a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model as the backbone, which excels at capturing global features for depth estimation. It integrates a detection transformer (DETR) architecture to improve both depth estimation and object detection performance in a one-stage manner. Specifically, a hierarchical feature fusion block is introduced to extract richer visual features from the foundation model, further enhancing feature extraction capabilities. Depth estimation accuracy is further improved by incorporating a relative depth estimation model trained on large-scale data and fine-tuning it through transfer learning. Additionally, the use of queries in the transformer's decoder, which consider reference points and the dimensions of 2D bounding boxes, enhances recognition performance.

However, such predictive models, often called world models, remains challenging to learn and are typically developed for task-specific solutions with online policy learning. To unlock world models' true potential, we argue that they should 1) be trainable on offline, pre-collected trajectories, 2) support test-time behavior optimization, and 3) facilitate task-agnostic reasoning. To this end, we present DINO World Model (DINO-WM), a new method to model visual dynamics without reconstructing the visual world. DINO-WM leverages spatial patch features pre-trained with DINOv2, enabling it to learn from offline behavioral trajectories by predicting future patch features. This allows DINO-WM to achieve observational goals through action sequence optimization, facilitating task-agnostic planning by treating goal features as prediction targets. We demonstrate that DINO-WM achieves zero-shot behavioral solutions at test time on six environments without expert demonstrations, reward modeling, or pre-learned inverse models, outperforming prior state-of-the-art work across diverse task families such as arbitrarily configured mazes, push manipulation with varied object shapes, and multi-particle scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

The primary source of information for surgical phase recognition is typically video, which presents two challenges: extracting meaningful features from the video stream and effectively modeling temporal information in the sequence of visual features. Methods: For temporal modeling, attention mechanisms have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we explore design choices for attention in existing temporal models for surgical phase recognition and propose a novel approach that uses attention more effectively and does not require hand-crafted constraints: TUNeS, an efficient and simple temporal model that incorporates self-attention at the core of a convolutional U-Net structure. In addition, we propose to train the feature extractor, a standard CNN, together with an LSTM on preferably long video segments, i.e., with long temporal context. Results: In our experiments, almost all temporal models performed better on top of feature extractors that were trained with longer temporal context. On these contextualized features, TUNeS achieves state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset. Conclusion: This study offers new insights on how to use attention mechanisms to build accurate and efficient temporal models for surgical phase recognition. Significance: Implementing automatic surgical phase recognition is essential to automate the analysis and optimization of surgical workflows and to enable context-aware computer assistance during surgery, thus ultimately improving patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering</p></details> | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce STDPose, a novel framework that enhances human pose estimation by learning spatiotemporal dynamics in sparsely-labeled videos. STDPose incorporates two key innovations: 1) A novel Dynamic-Aware Mask to capture long-range motion context, allowing for a nuanced understanding of pose changes. 2) A system for encoding and aggregating spatiotemporal representations and motion dynamics to effectively model spatiotemporal relationships, improving the accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. STDPose establishes a new performance benchmark for both video pose propagation (i.e., propagating pose annotations from labeled frames to unlabeled frames) and pose estimation tasks, across three large-scale evaluation datasets. Additionally, utilizing pseudo-labels generated by pose propagation, STDPose achieves competitive performance with only 26.7% labeled data.</p></details> |  | None |

Model-based visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in addressing these challenges but still faces notable limitations, particularly in handling sparse rewards and complex visual features in long-horizon environments. To address these limitations, we propose the Recognize-Sense-Plan-Act (RSPA) pipeline for long-horizon tasks and further introduce RoboHorizon, an LLM-assisted multi-view world model tailored for long-horizon robotic manipulation. In RoboHorizon, pre-trained LLMs generate dense reward structures for multi-stage sub-tasks based on task language instructions, enabling robots to better recognize long-horizon tasks. Keyframe discovery is then integrated into the multi-view masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture to enhance the robot's ability to sense critical task sequences, strengthening its multi-stage perception of long-horizon processes. Leveraging these dense rewards and multi-view representations, a robotic world model is constructed to efficiently plan long-horizon tasks, enabling the robot to reliably act through RL algorithms. Experiments on two representative benchmarks, RLBench and FurnitureBench, show that RoboHorizon outperforms state-of-the-art visual model-based RL methods, achieving a 23.35% improvement in task success rates on RLBench's 4 short-horizon tasks and a 29.23% improvement on 6 long-horizon tasks from RLBench and 3 furniture assembly tasks from FurnitureBench.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Most existing FAS methods are formulated as binary classification tasks, providing confidence scores without interpretation. They exhibit limited generalization in out-of-domain scenarios, such as new environments or unseen spoofing types. In this work, we introduce a multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework for FAS, termed Interpretable Face Anti-Spoofing (I-FAS), which transforms the FAS task into an interpretable visual question answering (VQA) paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Spoof-aware Captioning and Filtering (SCF) strategy to generate high-quality captions for FAS images, enriching the model's supervision with natural language interpretations. To mitigate the impact of noisy captions during training, we develop a Lopsided Language Model (L-LM) loss function that separates loss calculations for judgment and interpretation, prioritizing the optimization of the former. Furthermore, to enhance the model's perception of global visual features, we design a Globally Aware Connector (GAC) to align multi-level visual representations with the language model.

| **[Leveraging Textual Anatomical Knowledge for Class-Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Multi-Organ Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13470v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annotating 3D medical images demands substantial time and expertise, driving the adoption of semi-supervised learning (SSL) for segmentation tasks. However, the complex anatomical structures of organs often lead to significant class imbalances, posing major challenges for deploying SSL in real-world scenarios. Despite the availability of valuable prior information, such as inter-organ relative positions and organ shape priors, existing SSL methods have yet to fully leverage these insights. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates textual anatomical knowledge (TAK) into the segmentation model. Specifically, we use GPT-4o to generate textual descriptions of anatomical priors, which are then encoded using a CLIP-based model. These encoded priors are injected into the segmentation model as parameters of the segmentation head. Additionally, contrastive learning is employed to enhance the alignment between textual priors and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

These wounds can take up to nine months to heal, making regular care essential to ensure healing and prevent severe outcomes like limb amputations. Many patients receive care at home from visiting nurses with varying levels of wound expertise, leading to inconsistent care. Problematic, non-healing wounds should be referred to wound specialists, but referral decisions in non-clinical settings are often erroneous, delayed, or unnecessary. This paper introduces the Deep Multimodal Wound Assessment Tool (DM-WAT), a machine learning framework designed to assist visiting nurses in deciding whether to refer chronic wound patients. DM-WAT analyzes smartphone-captured wound images and clinical notes from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). It uses DeiT-Base-Distilled, a Vision Transformer (ViT), to extract visual features from images and DeBERTa-base to extract text features from clinical notes. DM-WAT combines visual and text features using an intermediate fusion approach. To address challenges posed by a small and imbalanced dataset, it integrates image and text augmentation with transfer learning to achieve high performance. In evaluations, DM-WAT achieved 77% with std 3% accuracy and a 70% with std 2% F1 score, outperforming prior approaches. Score-CAM and Captum interpretation algorithms provide insights into specific parts of image and text inputs that influence recommendations, enhancing interpretability and trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.05051 by other authors</p></details> | None |

This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%. This interpretable multi-agent framework bridges the gap between high-performance AI and the explainability required for reliable AI-driven CXR analysis in clinical settings.

Construction of the CIR model utilizes triplets that consist of a reference image, modification text describing desired changes, and a target image that reflects these changes. For effectively training CIR models, extensive manual annotation to construct high-quality training datasets, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, is required. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a novel triplet synthesis method by leveraging counterfactual image generation. By controlling visual feature modifications via counterfactual image generation, our approach automatically generates diverse training triplets without any manual intervention. This approach facilitates the creation of larger and more expressive datasets, leading to the improvement of CIR model's performance.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures | None |

However, this paper reveals a significant and previously unrecognized ethical risk inherent in this technology and introduces a novel method, termed the Cognitive Morphing Attack (CogMorph), which manipulates T2I models to generate images that retain the original core subjects but embeds toxic or harmful contextual elements. This nuanced manipulation exploits the cognitive principle that human perception of concepts is shaped by the entire visual scene and its context, producing images that amplify emotional harm far beyond attacks that merely preserve the original semantics. To address this, we first construct an imagery toxicity taxonomy spanning 10 major and 48 sub-categories, aligned with human cognitive-perceptual dimensions, and further build a toxicity risk matrix resulting in 1,176 high-quality T2I toxic prompts. Based on this, our CogMorph first introduces Cognitive Toxicity Augmentation, which develops a cognitive toxicity knowledge base with rich external toxic representations for humans (e.g., fine-grained visual features) that can be utilized to further guide the optimization of adversarial prompts. In addition, we present Contextual Hierarchical Morphing, which hierarchically extracts critical parts of the original prompt (e.g., scenes, subjects, and body parts), and then iteratively retrieves and fuses toxic features to inject harmful contexts. Extensive experiments on multiple open-sourced T2I models and black-box commercial APIs (e.g., DALLE-3) demonstrate the efficacy of CogMorph which significantly outperforms other baselines by large margins (+20.62% on average).</p></details> |  | None |

Traditionally, semantic mapping algorithms focus on a fixed set of semantic categories which limits their applicability for complex robotic tasks. Vision-Language (VL) models have recently emerged as a technique to jointly model language and visual features in a latent space, enabling semantic recognition beyond a predefined, fixed set of semantic classes. LatentBKI recurrently incorporates neural embeddings from VL models into a voxel map with quantifiable uncertainty, leveraging the spatial correlations of nearby observations through Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI). LatentBKI is evaluated against similar explicit semantic mapping and VL mapping frameworks on the popular Matterport3D and Semantic KITTI datasets, demonstrating that LatentBKI maintains the probabilistic benefits of continuous mapping with the additional benefit of open-dictionary queries. Real-world experiments demonstrate applicability to challenging indoor environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods assume ID images contain a single, centered object, and do not consider the more realistic multi-object scenarios, where both ID and OOD objects are present. To meet the needs of many users, the detection method must have the flexibility to adapt the type of ID images. To this end, we present Global-Local Maximum Concept Matching (GL-MCM), which incorporates local image scores as an auxiliary score to enhance the separability of global and local visual features. Due to the simple ensemble score function design, GL-MCM can control the type of ID images with a single weight parameter. Experiments on ImageNet and multi-object benchmarks demonstrate that GL-MCM outperforms baseline zero-shot methods and is comparable to fully supervised methods. Furthermore, GL-MCM offers strong flexibility in adjusting the target type of ID images.

While humans can easily detect speech by matching lip movements to audio, current ASD models struggle to establish this correspondence, often misclassifying non-speaking instances when audio and lip movements are unsynchronized. To address this limitation, we propose Lip landmark Assisted Speaker dEtection for Robustness (LASER). Unlike models that rely solely on facial frames, LASER explicitly focuses on lip movements by integrating lip landmarks in training. Specifically, given a face track, LASER extracts frame-level visual features and the 2D coordinates of lip landmarks using a lightweight detector. These coordinates are encoded into dense feature maps, providing spatial and structural information on lip positions. Recognizing that landmark detectors may sometimes fail under challenging conditions (e.g., low resolution, occlusions, extreme angles), we incorporate an auxiliary consistency loss to align predictions from both lip-aware and face-only features, ensuring reliable performance even when lip data is absent. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that LASER outperforms state-of-the-art models, especially in scenarios with desynchronized audio and visuals, demonstrating robust performance in real-world video contexts.

Given Michigan's relatively flat landscape, the focus is on systems that could serve as micro-hydro energy storage solutions. To ensure accuracy and reliability, the tool incorporates extensive data gathered from authorized sources, covering more than 420 water facilities and potential reservoirs in the state. These data are used as part of a case study to evaluate the tool's capabilities. Key parameters assessed include horizontal and vertical distances (head), volume, and the total storage capacity of each reservoir, measured in GWh. By analyzing these factors, the tool determines the suitability of various lakes and dams for hydroelectric power generation, and other uses based on the horizontal and vertical threshold distances. Its robust assessment framework integrates these metrics to comprehensively evaluate each site's potential. The tool's friendly interface and advanced data visualization features make the findings easy to interpret, facilitating optimal resource utilization and informed decision-making for state authorities.

In the context of oysters, meat quality assessment is paramount, focusing on shell, meat, gonad, and muscle components. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and subjective, prompting the adoption of machine vision technology for efficient and objective evaluation. We explore machine vision's capacity for segmenting oyster components, leading to the development of a multi-network ensemble approach with a global-local hierarchical attention mechanism. This approach integrates predictions from diverse models and addresses challenges posed by varying scales, ensuring robust instance segmentation across components. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance using different real-world datasets, highlighting its efficacy and robustness in enhancing oyster phenotype segmentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IDEA: Image Description Enhanced CLIP-Adapter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08816v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attained great success in pattern recognition and computer vision. Transferring CLIP to downstream tasks (e.g. zero- or few-shot classification) is a hot topic in multimodal learning. However, current studies primarily focus on either prompt learning for text or adapter tuning for vision, without fully exploiting the complementary information and correlations among image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose an Image Description Enhanced CLIP-Adapter (IDEA) method to adapt CLIP to few-shot image classification tasks. This method captures fine-grained features by leveraging both visual features and textual descriptions of images. IDEA is a training-free method for CLIP, and it can be comparable to or even exceeds state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks. Furthermore, we introduce Trainable-IDEA (T-IDEA), which extends IDEA by adding two lightweight learnable components (i.e., a projector and a learnable latent space), further enhancing the model's performance and achieving SOTA results on 11 datasets. As one important contribution, we employ the Llama model and design a comprehensive pipeline to generate textual descriptions for images of 11 datasets, resulting in a total of 1,637,795 image-text pairs, named "IMD-11".

However, existing methods mostly seek a direct mapping function from visual data to the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which is contradictory to the mechanism of practical subjective evaluation. To address this, we propose a novel language-driven PCQA method named CLIP-PCQA. Considering that human beings prefer to describe visual quality using discrete quality descriptions (e.g., "excellent" and "poor") rather than specific scores, we adopt a retrieval-based mapping strategy to simulate the process of subjective assessment. More specifically, based on the philosophy of CLIP, we calculate the cosine similarity between the visual features and multiple textual features corresponding to different quality descriptions, in which process an effective contrastive loss and learnable prompts are introduced to enhance the feature extraction. Meanwhile, given the personal limitations and bias in subjective experiments, we further covert the feature similarities into probabilities and consider the Opinion Score Distribution (OSD) rather than a single MOS as the final target. Experimental results show that our CLIP-PCQA outperforms other State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current LVLMs primarily rely on visual features extracted from the final layers of the vision encoder, overlooking the complementary information available in shallower layers. While recent approaches have explored the use of multilayer visual features in LVLMs, they tend to be task-agnostic and fail to examine the dependencies of hierarchical visual features on specific tasks. To address these gaps, we systematically investigate the contributions of visual features from different encoder layers using 18 benchmarks spanning 6 task categories. Our findings reveal that multilayer features provide complementary strengths with varying task dependencies, and uniform fusion leads to suboptimal performance. Building on these insights, we propose the instruction-guided vision aggregator, a module that dynamically integrates multi-layer visual features based on textual instructions, without increasing the number of visual tokens. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of the aggregator's behavior highlights the dominance of mid-to-high-level features in semantic-rich tasks and the critical role of low-level features in fine-grained perception.</p></details> |  | None |

On the contrary, large multimodal models~(LMMs) have shown eminent generalization ability on various vision tasks, and their perception and comprehension capabilities imply the potential of applying LMMs on IAD tasks. However, we observe that even though the LMMs have abundant knowledge about industrial anomaly detection in the textual domain, the LMMs are unable to leverage the knowledge due to the modality gap between textual and visual domains. To stimulate the relevant knowledge in LMMs and adapt the LMMs towards anomaly detection tasks, we introduce existing IAD methods as vision experts and present a novel large multimodal model applying vision experts for industrial anomaly detection~(abbreviated to {Myriad}). Specifically, we utilize the anomaly map generated by the vision experts as guidance for LMMs, such that the vision model is guided to pay more attention to anomalous regions. Then, the visual features are modulated via an adapter to fit the anomaly detection tasks, which are fed into the language model together with the vision expert guidance and human instructions to generate the final outputs. Extensive experiments are applied on MVTec-AD, VisA, and PCB Bank benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method not only performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods, but also inherits the flexibility and instruction-following ability of LMMs in the field of IAD.

We extend the original unsupervised text-based method to work with image data, leveraging deep learning techniques for visual feature extraction and similarity computation. Our method is applied to the ROGER dataset, a collection of photographs from the 1928 Sacambaya Expedition in Bolivia captured by Robert Gerstmann. We compare our algorithmically extracted visual narratives with expert-curated timelines of varying lengths (5 to 30 images) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to match the extracted narratives with the expert-curated baseline. In addition, we asked an expert on the topic to qualitatively evaluate a representative example of the resulting narratives. Our findings show that the narrative maps approach generally outperforms random sampling for longer timelines (10+ images, p < 0.05), with expert evaluation confirming the historical accuracy and coherence of the extracted narratives. This research contributes to the field of computational analysis of visual cultural heritage, offering new tools for historians, archivists, and digital humanities scholars to explore and understand large-scale image collections. The method's ability to generate meaningful narratives from visual data opens up new possibilities for the study and interpretation of historical events through photographic evidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for oral presentation in the findings track of the 47th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2025).

Inspired by the way human interpreters rely on context for accurate translation, we incorporate additional contextual cues together with the signing video, into a new translation framework. Specifically, besides visual sign recognition features that encode the input video, we integrate complementary textual information from (i) captions describing the background show, (ii) translation of previous sentences, as well as (iii) pseudo-glosses transcribing the signing. These are automatically extracted and inputted along with the visual features to a pre-trained large language model (LLM), which we fine-tune to generate spoken language translations in text form. Through extensive ablation studies, we show the positive contribution of each input cue to the translation performance. We train and evaluate our approach on BOBSL -- the largest British Sign Language dataset currently available. We show that our contextual approach significantly enhances the quality of the translations compared to previously reported results on BOBSL, and also to state-of-the-art methods that we implement as baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it also to How2Sign, an American Sign Language dataset, and achieve competitive results.</p></details> |  | None |

MAMo can augment and improve any single-image depth estimation networks into video depth estimation models, enabling them to take advantage of the temporal information to predict more accurate depth. In MAMo, we augment model with memory which aids the depth prediction as the model streams through the video. Specifically, the memory stores learned visual and displacement tokens of the previous time instances. This allows the depth network to cross-reference relevant features from the past when predicting depth on the current frame. We introduce a novel scheme to continuously update the memory, optimizing it to keep tokens that correspond with both the past and the present visual information. We adopt attention-based approach to process memory features where we first learn the spatio-temporal relation among the resultant visual and displacement memory tokens using self-attention module. Further, the output features of self-attention are aggregated with the current visual features through cross-attention. The cross-attended features are finally given to a decoder to predict depth on the current frame. Through extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including KITTI, NYU-Depth V2, and DDAD, we show that MAMo consistently improves monocular depth estimation networks and sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy. Notably, our MAMo video depth estimation provides higher accuracy with lower latency, when omparing to SOTA cost-volume-based video depth models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2023</p></details> | None |

Significant progress has been made in data-driven VO methods, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques to extract image features and estimate camera poses. However, these methods often struggle in low-light conditions because of the reduced visibility of features and the increased difficulty of matching keypoints. To address this limitation, we introduce BrightVO, a novel VO model based on Transformer architecture, which not only performs front-end visual feature extraction, but also incorporates a multi-modality refinement module in the back-end that integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. Using pose graph optimization, this module iteratively refines pose estimates to reduce errors and improve both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we create a synthetic low-light dataset, KiC4R, which includes a variety of lighting conditions to facilitate the training and evaluation of VO frameworks in challenging environments. Experimental results demonstrate that BrightVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the KiC4R dataset and the KITTI benchmarks. Specifically, it provides an average improvement of 20% in pose estimation accuracy in normal outdoor environments and 259% in low-light conditions, outperforming existing methods.

The inherent visual complexity of camouflaged objects, including their low contrast with the background, diverse textures, and subtle appearance variations, often obscures semantic cues, making accurate segmentation highly challenging. Existing methods primarily rely on visual features, which are insufficient to handle the variability and intricacy of camouflaged objects, leading to unstable object perception and ambiguous segmentation results. To tackle these limitations, we introduce a novel task, class-guided camouflaged object detection (CGCOD), which extends traditional COD task by incorporating object-specific class knowledge to enhance detection robustness and accuracy. To facilitate this task, we present a new dataset, CamoClass, comprising real-world camouflaged objects with class annotations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage framework, CGNet, which incorporates a plug-and-play class prompt generator and a simple yet effective class-guided detector. This establishes a new paradigm for COD, bridging the gap between contextual understanding and class-guided detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our flexible framework in improving the performance of proposed and existing detectors by leveraging class-level textual information.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Densely Connected Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08580v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of computer vision, Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PET) is increasingly replacing the traditional paradigm of pre-training followed by full fine-tuning. PET is particularly favored for its effectiveness in large foundation models, as it streamlines transfer learning costs and optimizes hardware utilization. However, the current PET methods are mainly designed for single-modal optimization. While some pioneering studies have undertaken preliminary explorations, they still remain at the level of aligned encoders (e.g., CLIP) and lack exploration of misaligned encoders. These methods show sub-optimal performance with misaligned encoders, as they fail to effectively align the multimodal features during fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce DETRIS, a parameter-efficient tuning framework designed to enhance low-rank visual feature propagation by establishing dense interconnections between each layer and all preceding layers, which enables effective cross-modal feature interaction and adaptation to misaligned encoders. We also suggest using text adapters to improve textual features. Our simple yet efficient approach greatly surpasses state-of-the-art methods with 0.9% to 1.8% backbone parameter updates, evaluated on challenging benchmarks.

However, most studies rely on highly controlled laboratory environments with scripted stimuli. Here, we examine the audio visual benefit using unscripted, natural speech from untrained speakers within a virtual acoustic environment. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and cortical speech tracking, we assessed neural responses across audio visual, audio only, visual only, and masked lip conditions to isolate the role of lip movements. Additionally, we analysed individual differences in acoustic and visual features of the speakers, including pitch, jitter, and lip openness, to explore their influence on the audio visual speech tracking benefit. Results showed a significant audio visual enhancement in speech tracking with background noise, with the masked lip condition performing similarly to the audio-only condition, emphasizing the importance of lip movements in adverse listening situations. Our findings reveal the feasibility of cortical speech tracking with naturalistic stimuli and underscore the impact of individual speaker characteristics on audio-visual integration in real world listening contexts.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Versatile Collage Visualization Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04008v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collage techniques are commonly used in visualization to organize a collection of geometric shapes, facilitating the representation of visual features holistically, as seen in word clouds or circular packing diagrams. Typically, packing methods rely on object-space optimization techniques, which often necessitate customizing the optimization process to suit the complexity of geometric primitives and the specific application requirements. In this paper, we introduce a versatile image-space collage technique designed to pack geometric elements into a given shape. Leveraging a differential renderer and image-space losses, our optimization process is highly efficient and can easily accommodate various loss functions. We demonstrate the diverse visual expressiveness of our approach across various visualization applications. The evaluation confirmed the benefits of our method in terms of both visual quality and time performance.

While Transformer-based methods have shown promise, their handling of long-range dependencies struggles due to quadratic computational costs, presenting a bottleneck in complex scenarios. To overcome this limitation and facilitate complex multi-modal comprehension with linear complexity, we introduce AVS-Mamba, a selective state space model to address the AVS task. Our framework incorporates two key components for video understanding and cross-modal learning: Temporal Mamba Block for sequential video processing and Vision-to-Audio Fusion Block for advanced audio-vision integration. Building on this, we develop the Multi-scale Temporal Encoder, aimed at enhancing the learning of visual features across scales, facilitating the perception of intra- and inter-frame information. To perform multi-modal fusion, we propose the Modality Aggregation Decoder, leveraging the Vision-to-Audio Fusion Block to integrate visual features into audio features across both frame and temporal levels. Further, we adopt the Contextual Integration Pyramid to perform audio-to-vision spatial-temporal context collaboration. Through these innovative contributions, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on the AVSBench-object and AVSBench-semantic datasets. Our source code and model weights are available at AVS-Mamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> | None |

Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634. Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.

In skin cancer diagnosis, while advancements in lesion detection and classification have improved accuracy, the black-box nature of these methods poses challenges in understanding their decision processes, leading to trust issues among physicians. This study leverages the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model, trained on different skin lesion datasets, to capture meaningful relationships between visual features and diagnostic criteria terms. To further enhance transparency, we propose a method called MedGrad E-CLIP, which builds on gradient-based E-CLIP by incorporating a weighted entropy mechanism designed for complex medical imaging like skin lesions. This approach highlights critical image regions linked to specific diagnostic descriptions. The developed integrated pipeline not only classifies skin lesions by matching corresponding descriptions but also adds an essential layer of explainability developed especially for medical data. By visually explaining how different features in an image relates to diagnostic criteria, this approach demonstrates the potential of advanced vision-language models in medical image analysis, ultimately improving transparency, robustness, and trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW)</p></details> | None |
| **[Explaining Datasets in Words: Statistical Models with Natural Language Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08466v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To make sense of massive data, we often fit simplified models and then interpret the parameters; for example, we cluster the text embeddings and then interpret the mean parameters of each cluster. However, these parameters are often high-dimensional and hard to interpret. To make model parameters directly interpretable, we introduce a family of statistical models -- including clustering, time series, and classification models -- parameterized by natural language predicates. For example, a cluster of text about COVID could be parameterized by the predicate "discusses COVID". To learn these statistical models effectively, we develop a model-agnostic algorithm that optimizes continuous relaxations of predicate parameters with gradient descent and discretizes them by prompting language models (LMs). Finally, we apply our framework to a wide range of problems: taxonomizing user chat dialogues, characterizing how they evolve across time, finding categories where one language model is better than the other, clustering math problems based on subareas, and explaining visual features in memorable images. Our framework is highly versatile, applicable to both textual and visual domains, can be easily steered to focus on specific properties (e.g. subareas), and explains sophisticated concepts that classical methods (e.g. n-gram analysis) struggle to produce.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GeoPix: Multi-Modal Large Language Model for Pixel-level Image Understanding in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06828v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in image- and region-level remote sensing (RS) image understanding tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding. However, existing RS MLLMs lack the pixel-level dialogue capability, which involves responding to user instructions with segmentation masks for specific instances. In this paper, we propose GeoPix, a RS MLLM that extends image understanding capabilities to the pixel level. This is achieved by equipping the MLLM with a mask predictor, which transforms visual features from the vision encoder into masks conditioned on the LLM's segmentation token embeddings. To facilitate the segmentation of multi-scale objects in RS imagery, a class-wise learnable memory module is integrated into the mask predictor to capture and store class-wise geo-context at the instance level across the entire dataset. In addition, to address the absence of large-scale datasets for training pixel-level RS MLLMs, we construct the GeoPixInstruct dataset, comprising 65,463 images and 140,412 instances, with each instance annotated with text descriptions, bounding boxes, and masks. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training strategy to balance the distinct requirements of text generation and masks prediction in multi-modal multi-task optimization. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and superiority of GeoPix in pixel-level segmentation tasks, while also maintaining competitive performance in image- and region-level benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RSRefSeg: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06809v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring remote sensing image segmentation is crucial for achieving fine-grained visual understanding through free-format textual input, enabling enhanced scene and object extraction in remote sensing applications. Current research primarily utilizes pre-trained language models to encode textual descriptions and align them with visual modalities, thereby facilitating the expression of relevant visual features. However, these approaches often struggle to establish robust alignments between fine-grained semantic concepts, leading to inconsistent representations across textual and visual information. To address these limitations, we introduce a referring remote sensing image segmentation foundational model, RSRefSeg. RSRefSeg leverages CLIP for visual and textual encoding, employing both global and local textual semantics as filters to generate referring-related visual activation features in the latent space. These activated features then serve as input prompts for SAM, which refines the segmentation masks through its robust visual generalization capabilities. Experimental results on the RRSIS-D dataset demonstrate that RSRefSeg outperforms existing methods, underscoring the effectiveness of foundational models in enhancing multimodal task comprehension.

| **[Understanding Multimodal LLMs: the Mechanistic Interpretability of Llava in Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10950v2)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the mechanisms behind Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for designing improved models and strategies. While recent studies have yielded valuable insights into the mechanisms of textual LLMs, the mechanisms of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remain underexplored. In this paper, we apply mechanistic interpretability methods to analyze the visual question answering (VQA) mechanisms in the first MLLM, Llava. We compare the mechanisms between VQA and textual QA (TQA) in color answering tasks and find that: a) VQA exhibits a mechanism similar to the in-context learning mechanism observed in TQA; b) the visual features exhibit significant interpretability when projecting the visual embeddings into the embedding space; and c) Llava enhances the existing capabilities of the corresponding textual LLM Vicuna during visual instruction tuning. Based on these findings, we develop an interpretability tool to help users and researchers identify important visual locations for final predictions, aiding in the understanding of visual hallucination. Our method demonstrates faster and more effective results compared to existing interpretability approaches.

| **[Open Eyes, Then Reason: Fine-grained Visual Mathematical Understanding in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06430v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often underperform on mathematical problem-solving tasks that require fine-grained visual understanding. The limitation is largely attributable to inadequate perception of geometric primitives during image-level contrastive pre-training (e.g., CLIP). While recent efforts to improve math MLLMs have focused on scaling up mathematical visual instruction datasets and employing stronger LLM backbones, they often overlook persistent errors in visual recognition. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the visual grounding capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal a significant negative correlation between visual grounding accuracy and problem-solving performance, underscoring the critical role of fine-grained visual understanding. Notably, advanced models like GPT-4o exhibit a 70% error rate when identifying geometric entities, highlighting that this remains a key bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel approach, SVE-Math (Selective Vision-Enhanced Mathematical MLLM), featuring a geometric-grounded vision encoder and a feature router that dynamically adjusts the contribution of hierarchical visual feature maps. Our model recognizes accurate visual primitives and generates precise visual prompts tailored to the language model's reasoning needs. In experiments, SVE-Math-Qwen2.5-7B outperforms other 7B models by 15% on MathVerse and is compatible with GPT-4V on MathVista. Despite being trained on smaller datasets, SVE-Math-7B achieves competitive performance on GeoQA, rivaling models trained on significantly larger datasets. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating fine-grained visual understanding into MLLMs and provide a promising direction for future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Neural Differential Appearance Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07128v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to reproduce dynamic appearance textures with space-stationary but time-varying visual statistics. While most previous work decomposes dynamic textures into static appearance and motion, we focus on dynamic appearance that results not from motion but variations of fundamental properties, such as rusting, decaying, melting, and weathering. To this end, we adopt the neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to learn the underlying dynamics of appearance from a target exemplar. We simulate the ODE in two phases. At the "warm-up" phase, the ODE diffuses a random noise to an initial state. We then constrain the further evolution of this ODE to replicate the evolution of visual feature statistics in the exemplar during the generation phase. The particular innovation of this work is the neural ODE achieving both denoising and evolution for dynamics synthesis, with a proposed temporal training scheme. We study both relightable (BRDF) and non-relightable (RGB) appearance models. For both we introduce new pilot datasets, allowing, for the first time, to study such phenomena: For RGB we provide 22 dynamic textures acquired from free online sources; For BRDFs, we further acquire a dataset of 21 flash-lit videos of time-varying materials, enabled by a simple-to-construct setup. Our experiments show that our method consistently yields realistic and coherent results, whereas prior works falter under pronounced temporal appearance variations. A user study confirms our approach is preferred to previous work for such exemplars.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 Journal Track.

In contrast to prevailing two-stage methods based on a large object detector (e.g., Faster R-CNN), one-stage methods integrate a fixed-size set of learnable queries to jointly reason relational triplets <subject, predicate, object>. This paradigm demonstrates robust performance with significantly reduced parameters and computational overhead. However, the challenge in one-stage methods stems from the issue of weak entanglement, wherein entities involved in relationships require both coupled features shared within triplets and decoupled visual features. Previous methods either adopt a single decoder for coupled triplet feature modeling or multiple decoders for separate visual feature extraction but fail to consider both. In this paper, we introduce UniQ, a Unified decoder with task-specific Queries architecture, where task-specific queries generate decoupled visual features for subjects, objects, and predicates respectively, and unified decoder enables coupled feature modeling within relational triplets. Experimental results on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate that UniQ has superior performance to both one-stage and two-stage methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[IPDN: Image-enhanced Prompt Decoding Network for 3D Referring Expression Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04995v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) aims to segment point cloud scenes based on a given expression. However, existing 3D-RES approaches face two major challenges: feature ambiguity and intent ambiguity. Feature ambiguity arises from information loss or distortion during point cloud acquisition due to limitations such as lighting and viewpoint. Intent ambiguity refers to the model's equal treatment of all queries during the decoding process, lacking top-down task-specific guidance. In this paper, we introduce an Image enhanced Prompt Decoding Network (IPDN), which leverages multi-view images and task-driven information to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. To address feature ambiguity, we propose the Multi-view Semantic Embedding (MSE) module, which injects multi-view 2D image information into the 3D scene and compensates for potential spatial information loss. To tackle intent ambiguity, we designed a Prompt-Aware Decoder (PAD) that guides the decoding process by deriving task-driven signals from the interaction between the expression and visual features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IPDN outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 1.9 and 4.2 points in mIoU metrics on the 3D-RES and 3D-GRES tasks, respectively.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 | None |
| **[Hyper-3DG: Text-to-3D Gaussian Generation via Hypergraph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09236v2)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D generation represents an exciting field that has seen rapid advancements, facilitating the transformation of textual descriptions into detailed 3D models. However, current progress often neglects the intricate high-order correlation of geometry and texture within 3D objects, leading to challenges such as over-smoothness, over-saturation and the Janus problem. In this work, we propose a method named ``3D Gaussian Generation via Hypergraph (Hyper-3DG)'', designed to capture the sophisticated high-order correlations present within 3D objects. Our framework is anchored by a well-established mainflow and an essential module, named ``Geometry and Texture Hypergraph Refiner (HGRefiner)''. This module not only refines the representation of 3D Gaussians but also accelerates the update process of these 3D Gaussians by conducting the Patch-3DGS Hypergraph Learning on both explicit attributes and latent visual features. Our framework allows for the production of finely generated 3D objects within a cohesive optimization, effectively circumventing degradation. Extensive experimentation has shown that our proposed method significantly enhances the quality of 3D generation while incurring no additional computational overhead for the underlying framework.

However, the accurate reconstruction of diverse details, including structure, background, texture, color, and more, remains challenging. The stable diffusion models inevitably result in the variability of reconstructed images, even under identical conditions. To address this challenge, we first uncover the neuroscientific perspective of diffusion methods, which primarily involve top-down creation using pre-trained knowledge from extensive image datasets, but tend to lack detail-driven bottom-up perception, leading to a loss of faithful details. In this paper, we propose NeuralDiffuser, which incorporates primary visual feature guidance to provide detailed cues in the form of gradients. This extension of the bottom-up process for diffusion models achieves both semantic coherence and detail fidelity when reconstructing visual stimuli. Furthermore, we have developed a novel guidance strategy for reconstruction tasks that ensures the consistency of repeated outputs with original images rather than with various outputs. Extensive experimental results on the Natural Senses Dataset (NSD) qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the advancement of NeuralDiffuser by comparing it against baseline and state-of-the-art methods horizontally, as well as conducting longitudinal ablation studies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable "Reference" prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in the vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into different features, i.e., the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between the Reference feature and the positional feature, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and the rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. A contrastive loss based on the masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed, which makes the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

However, reconstructing high-quality images from the spike input under low-light conditions remains challenging. Conventional learning-based methods often rely on the synthetic dataset as the supervision for training. Still, these approaches falter when dealing with noisy spikes fired under the low-light environment, leading to further performance degradation in the real-world dataset. This phenomenon is primarily due to inadequate noise modelling and the domain gap between synthetic and real datasets, resulting in recovered images with unclear textures, excessive noise, and diminished brightness. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel spike-to-image reconstruction framework SpikeCLIP that goes beyond traditional training paradigms. Leveraging the CLIP model's powerful capability to align text and images, we incorporate the textual description of the captured scene and unpaired high-quality datasets as the supervision. Our experiments on real-world low-light datasets U-CALTECH and U-CIFAR demonstrate that SpikeCLIP significantly enhances texture details and the luminance balance of recovered images. Furthermore, the reconstructed images are well-aligned with the broader visual features needed for downstream tasks, ensuring more robust and versatile performance in challenging environments.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 | None |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios.

Recent works have explored vision-language models (VLMs) as a promising alternative, using multi-view rendering and textual prompting to identify object parts. However, naively applying VLMs in this context introduces several drawbacks, such as the need for meticulous prompt engineering, and fails to leverage the 3D geometric structure of objects. To address these limitations, we propose COPS, a COmprehensive model for Parts Segmentation that blends the semantics extracted from visual concepts and 3D geometry to effectively identify object parts. COPS renders a point cloud from multiple viewpoints, extracts 2D features, projects them back to 3D, and uses a novel geometric-aware feature aggregation procedure to ensure spatial and semantic consistency. Finally, it clusters points into parts and labels them. We demonstrate that COPS is efficient, scalable, and achieves zero-shot state-of-the-art performance across five datasets, covering synthetic and real-world data, texture-less and coloured objects, as well as rigid and non-rigid shapes.

Unfortunately, existing methods rely on dataset-specific hyperparameters, significantly limiting their adaptability to unseen tasks. In response, we propose Online Gaussian Adaptation (OGA), a novel method that models the likelihoods of visual features using Gaussian distributions and incorporates zero-shot priors into an interpretable Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation framework with fixed hyper-parameters across all datasets. We demonstrate that OGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on most datasets and runs. Additionally, we show that combining OTTA with popular few-shot techniques (a practical yet overlooked setting in prior research) is highly beneficial. Furthermore, our experimental study reveals that common OTTA evaluation protocols, which average performance over at most three runs per dataset, are inadequate due to the substantial variability observed across runs for all OTTA methods. Therefore, we advocate for more rigorous evaluation practices, including increasing the number of runs and considering additional quantitative metrics, such as our proposed Expected Tail Accuracy (ETA), calculated as the average accuracy in the worst 10% of runs. We hope these contributions will encourage more rigorous and diverse evaluation practices in the OTTA community.

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods.

| **[KAnoCLIP: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection through Knowledge-Driven Prompt Learning and Enhanced Cross-Modal Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03786v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) identifies anomalies without needing training samples from the target dataset, essential for scenarios with privacy concerns or limited data. Vision-language models like CLIP show potential in ZSAD but have limitations: relying on manually crafted fixed textual descriptions or anomaly prompts is time-consuming and prone to semantic ambiguity, and CLIP struggles with pixel-level anomaly segmentation, focusing more on global semantics than local details. To address these limitations, We introduce KAnoCLIP, a novel ZSAD framework that leverages vision-language models. KAnoCLIP combines general knowledge from a Large Language Model (GPT-3.5) and fine-grained, image-specific knowledge from a Visual Question Answering system (Llama3) via Knowledge-Driven Prompt Learning (KnPL). KnPL uses a knowledge-driven (KD) loss function to create learnable anomaly prompts, removing the need for fixed text prompts and enhancing generalization. KAnoCLIP includes the CLIP visual encoder with V-V attention (CLIP-VV), Bi-Directional Cross-Attention for Multi-Level Cross-Modal Interaction (Bi-CMCI), and Conv-Adapter. These components preserve local visual semantics, improve local cross-modal fusion, and align global visual features with textual information, enhancing pixel-level anomaly detection. KAnoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZSAD across 12 industrial and medical datasets, demonstrating superior generalization compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Scale-wise Bidirectional Alignment Network for Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00851v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) is to extract specific pixel-level regions within an aerial image via a natural language expression. Recent advancements, particularly Transformer-based fusion designs, have demonstrated remarkable progress in this domain. However, existing methods primarily focus on refining visual features using language-aware guidance during the cross-modal fusion stage, neglecting the complementary vision-to-language flow. This limitation often leads to irrelevant or suboptimal representations. In addition, the diverse spatial scales of ground objects in aerial images pose significant challenges to the visual perception capabilities of existing models when conditioned on textual inputs. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework called Scale-wise Bidirectional Alignment Network (SBANet) to address these challenges for RRSIS. Specifically, we design a Bidirectional Alignment Module (BAM) with learnable query tokens to selectively and effectively represent visual and linguistic features, emphasizing regions associated with key tokens. BAM is further enhanced with a dynamic feature selection block, designed to provide both macro- and micro-level visual features, preserving global context and local details to facilitate more effective cross-modal interaction. Furthermore, SBANet incorporates a text-conditioned channel and spatial aggregator to bridge the gap between the encoder and decoder, enhancing cross-scale information exchange in complex aerial scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods on the RRSIS-D and RefSegRS datasets, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The code will be released after publication.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[Dense Video Captioning Using Unsupervised Semantic Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08455v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a method to learn unsupervised semantic visual information based on the premise that complex events can be decomposed into simpler events and that these simple events are shared across several complex events. We first employ a clustering method to group representations producing a visual codebook. Then, we learn a dense representation by encoding the co-occurrence probability matrix for the codebook entries. This representation leverages the performance of the dense video captioning task in a scenario with only visual features. For example, we replace the audio signal in the BMT method and produce temporal proposals with comparable performance. Furthermore, we concatenate the visual representation with our descriptor in a vanilla transformer method to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the captioning subtask compared to the methods that explore only visual features, as well as a competitive performance with multi-modal methods.

| **[PiLaMIM: Toward Richer Visual Representations by Integrating Pixel and Latent Masked Image Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03005v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Masked Image Modeling (MIM), two primary methods exist: Pixel MIM and Latent MIM, each utilizing different reconstruction targets, raw pixels and latent representations, respectively. Pixel MIM tends to capture low-level visual details such as color and texture, while Latent MIM focuses on high-level semantics of an object. However, these distinct strengths of each method can lead to suboptimal performance in tasks that rely on a particular level of visual features. To address this limitation, we propose PiLaMIM, a unified framework that combines Pixel MIM and Latent MIM to integrate their complementary strengths. Our method uses a single encoder along with two distinct decoders: one for predicting pixel values and another for latent representations, ensuring the capture of both high-level and low-level visual features. We further integrate the CLS token into the reconstruction process to aggregate global context, enabling the model to capture more semantic information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiLaMIM outperforms key baselines such as MAE, I-JEPA and BootMAE in most cases, proving its effectiveness in extracting richer visual representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TC-KANRecon: High-Quality and Accelerated MRI Reconstruction via Adaptive KAN Mechanisms and Intelligent Feature Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05705v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become essential in clinical diagnosis due to its high resolution and multiple contrast mechanisms. However, the relatively long acquisition time limits its broader application. To address this issue, this study presents an innovative conditional guided diffusion model, named as TC-KANRecon, which incorporates the Multi-Free U-KAN (MF-UKAN) module and a dynamic clipping strategy. TC-KANRecon model aims to accelerate the MRI reconstruction process through deep learning methods while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed images. The MF-UKAN module can effectively balance the tradeoff between image denoising and structure preservation. Specifically, it presents the multi-head attention mechanisms and scalar modulation factors, which significantly enhances the model's robustness and structure preservation capabilities in complex noise environments. Moreover, the dynamic clipping strategy in TC-KANRecon adjusts the cropping interval according to the sampling steps, thereby mitigating image detail loss typicalching the visual features of the images. Furthermore, the MC-Model incorporates full-sampling k-space information, realizing efficient fusion of conditional information, enhancing the model's ability to process complex data, and improving the realism and detail richness of reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other MRI reconstruction methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, TC-KANRecon method exhibits excellent reconstruction results when processing high-noise, low-sampling-rate MRI data.

Here, we propose a new way to model spatial co-occurrences by aligning local representations (before pooling) with a global image representation. We present CO-SSL, a family of instance discrimination methods and show that it outperforms previous methods on several datasets, including ImageNet-1K where it achieves 71.5% of Top-1 accuracy with 100 pre-training epochs. CO-SSL is also more robust to noise corruption, internal corruption, small adversarial attacks, and large training crop sizes. Our analysis further indicates that CO-SSL learns highly redundant local representations, which offers an explanation for its robustness. Overall, our work suggests that aligning local and global representations may be a powerful principle of unsupervised category learning.</p></details> | 20 pages | None |
| **[Multi-Modal One-Shot Federated Ensemble Learning for Medical Data with Vision Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03292v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has attracted considerable interest in the medical domain due to its capacity to facilitate collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy. However, conventional FL methods typically necessitate multiple communication rounds, leading to significant communication overhead and delays, especially in environments with limited bandwidth. One-shot federated learning addresses these issues by conducting model training and aggregation in a single communication round, thereby reducing communication costs while preserving privacy. Among these, one-shot federated ensemble learning combines independently trained client models using ensemble techniques such as voting, further boosting performance in non-IID data scenarios. On the other hand, existing machine learning methods in healthcare predominantly use unimodal data (e.g., medical images or textual reports), which restricts their diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness. Therefore, the integration of multi-modal data is proposed to address these shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce FedMME, an innovative one-shot multi-modal federated ensemble learning framework that utilizes multi-modal data for medical image analysis. Specifically, FedMME capitalizes on vision large language models to produce textual reports from medical images, employs a BERT model to extract textual features from these reports, and amalgamates these features with visual features to improve diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that our method demonstrated superior performance compared to existing one-shot federated learning methods in healthcare scenarios across four datasets with various data distributions. For instance, it surpasses existing one-shot federated learning approaches by more than 17.5% in accuracy on the RSNA dataset when applying a Dirichlet distribution with ($\alpha$ = 0.3).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CCStereo: Audio-Visual Contextual and Contrastive Learning for Binaural Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02786v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binaural audio generation (BAG) aims to convert monaural audio to stereo audio using visual prompts, requiring a deep understanding of spatial and semantic information. However, current models risk overfitting to room environments and lose fine-grained spatial details. In this paper, we propose a new audio-visual binaural generation model incorporating an audio-visual conditional normalisation layer that dynamically aligns the mean and variance of the target difference audio features using visual context, along with a new contrastive learning method to enhance spatial sensitivity by mining negative samples from shuffled visual features. We also introduce a cost-efficient way to utilise test-time augmentation in video data to enhance performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation accuracy on the FAIR-Play and MUSIC-Stereo benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
