| **[FineTec: Fine-Grained Action Recognition Under Temporal Corruption via Skeleton Decomposition and Sequence Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25067v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

| **[AI-Driven Evaluation of Surgical Skill via Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24411v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Lifelong Domain Adaptive 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23860v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[Patch as Node: Human-Centric Graph Representation Learning for Multimodal Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21916v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While human action recognition has witnessed notable achievements, multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton modalities still suffer from their inherent heterogeneity and fail to fully exploit the complementary potential between them. In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Skeleton-Based Action Representation Learning: A Benchmark and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02978v3)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL), which aims to learn meaningful prior representations from unlabeled data, has been proven effective for skeleton-based action understanding. Different from the image domain, skeleton data possesses sparser spatial structures and diverse representation forms, with the absence of background clues and the additional temporal dimension, presenting new challenges for spatial-temporal motion pretext task design. Recently, many endeavors have been made for skeleton-based SSL, achieving remarkable progress. However, a systematic and thorough review is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct, for the first time, a comprehensive survey on self-supervised skeleton-based action representation learning. Following the taxonomy of context-based, generative learning, and contrastive learning approaches, we make a thorough review and benchmark of existing works and shed light on the future possible directions. Remarkably, our investigation demonstrates that most SSL works rely on the single paradigm, learning representations of a single level, and are evaluated on the action recognition task solely, which leaves the generalization power of skeleton SSL models under-explored. To this end, a novel and effective SSL method for skeleton is further proposed, which integrates versatile representation learning objectives of different granularity, substantially boosting the generalization capacity for multiple skeleton downstream tasks. Extensive experiments under three large-scale datasets demonstrate our method achieves superior generalization performance on various downstream tasks, including recognition, retrieval, detection, and few-shot learning.</p></details> | IJCV 2025 | None |
| **[Bridging Modalities and Transferring Knowledge: Enhanced Multimodal Understanding and Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20501v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This manuscript explores multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference to enhance machine understanding of complex inputs. We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning. Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding. Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability. Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights. Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy. Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance. These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ph.D....</summary><p>Ph.D. manuscript; Supervisors/Mentors: Marie-Francine Moens and Tinne Tuytelaars</p></details> | None |
| **[Beyond Motion Pattern: An Empirical Study of Physical Forces for Human Motion Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20451v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DETACH : Decomposed Spatio-Temporal Alignment for Exocentric Video and Ambient Sensors with Staged Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20409v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Effect of Activation Function and Model Optimizer on the Performance of Human Activity Recognition System Using Various Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20104v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Contextual Analysis of Driver-Facing and Dual-View Video Inputs for Distraction Detection in Naturalistic Driving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20025v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Signal-SGN++: Topology-Enhanced Time-Frequency Spiking Graph Network for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22214v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SNN-Driven Multimodal Human Action Recognition via Sparse Spatial-Temporal Data Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13385v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal human action recognition based on RGB and skeleton data fusion, while effective, is constrained by significant limitations such as high computational complexity, excessive memory consumption, and substantial energy demands, particularly when implemented with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). These limitations restrict its applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-driven framework for multimodal human action recognition, utilizing event camera and skeleton data. Our framework is centered on two key innovations: (1) a novel multimodal SNN architecture that employs distinct backbone networks for each modality-an SNN-based Mamba for event camera data and a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (SGN) for skeleton data-combined with a spiking semantic extraction module to capture deep semantic representations; and (2) a pioneering SNN-based discretized information bottleneck mechanism for modality fusion, which effectively balances the preservation of modality-specific semantics with efficient information compression. To validate our approach, we propose a novel method for constructing a multimodal dataset that integrates event camera and skeleton data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both recognition accuracy and energy efficiency, offering a promising solution for practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Distinguishing Visually Similar Actions: Prompt-Guided Semantic Prototype Modulation for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19036v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot action recognition aims to enable models to quickly learn new action categories from limited labeled samples, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in real-world applications. Current research primarily addresses three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling, where models are prone to interference from irrelevant static background information and struggle to capture the essence of dynamic action features; (2) visual similarity, where categories with subtle visual differences are difficult to distinguish; and (3) the modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries, which complicates alignment within a shared embedding space. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CLIP-SPM framework, which includes three components: (1) the Hierarchical Synergistic Motion Refinement (HSMR) module, which aligns deep and shallow motion features to improve temporal modeling by reducing static background interference; (2) the Semantic Prototype Modulation (SPM) strategy, which generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge the modality gap and integrates them with visual features, enhancing the discriminability between similar actions; and (3) the Prototype-Anchor Dual Modulation (PADM) method, which refines support prototypes and aligns query features with a global semantic anchor, improving consistency across support and query samples. Comprehensive experiments across standard benchmarks, including Kinetics, SSv2-Full, SSv2-Small, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate that our CLIP-SPM achieves competitive performance under 1-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot settings. Extensive ablation studies and visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component and its contributions to addressing the core challenges.

| **[Context-Aware Network Based on Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Attention for Action Recognition in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18750v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a critical task in video understanding, requiring the comprehensive capture of spatio-temporal cues across various scales. However, existing methods often overlook the multi-granularity nature of actions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Context-Aware Network (CAN). CAN consists of two core modules: the Multi-scale Temporal Cue Module (MTCM) and the Group Spatial Cue Module (GSCM). MTCM effectively extracts temporal cues at multiple scales, capturing both fast-changing motion details and overall action flow. GSCM, on the other hand, extracts spatial cues at different scales by grouping feature maps and applying specialized extraction methods to each group. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (Something-Something V1 and V2, Diving48, Kinetics-400, and UCF101) demonstrate the effectiveness of CAN. Our approach achieves competitive performance, outperforming most mainstream methods, with accuracies of 50.4% on Something-Something V1, 63.9% on Something-Something V2, 88.4% on Diving48, 74.9% on Kinetics-400, and 86.9% on UCF101. These results highlight the importance of capturing multi-scale spatio-temporal cues for robust action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Framework for Multisource Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18553v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multisource domain adaptation (MDA) aims to use multiple source datasets with available labels to infer labels on a target dataset without available labels for target supervision. Prior works on MDA in the literature is ad-hoc as the pretraining of source models is either based on weight sharing or uses independently trained models. This work proposes a Bayesian framework for pretraining in MDA by considering that the distributions of different source domains are typically similar. The Hierarchical Bayesian Framework uses similarity between the different source data distributions to optimize the pretraining for MDA. Experiments using the proposed Bayesian framework for MDA show that our framework improves accuracy on recognition tasks for a large benchmark dataset. Performance comparison with state-of-the-art MDA methods on the challenging problem of human action recognition in multi-domain benchmark Daily-DA RGB video shows the proposed Bayesian Framework offers a 17.29% improvement in accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Skeleton-Snippet Contrastive Learning with Multiscale Feature Fusion for Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16504v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The self-supervised pretraining paradigm has achieved great success in learning 3D action representations for skeleton-based action recognition using contrastive learning. However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.</p></details> |  | None |

Basically, there are two main difficulties for activity recognition in this scenario. First, human activities are often recorded at a distance, and appear in a small resolution without much discriminative clue. Second, these activities are naturally distributed in a long-tailed way. It is hard to alleviate data bias for such heavy category imbalance. To tackle these problems, we propose a comprehensive recognition solution in this paper. First, we train video backbones with data balance, in order to alleviate overfitting in the challenge benchmark. Second, we design a dual-resolution distillation framework, which can effectively guide low-resolution action recognition by super-resolution knowledge. Finally, we apply model en-semble with post-processing, which can further boost per-formance on the long-tailed categories.

We present a systematic analysis of background bias across classification models, contrastive text-image pretrained models, and Video Large Language Models (VLLM) and find that all exhibit a strong tendency to default to background reasoning. Next, we propose mitigation strategies for classification models and show that incorporating segmented human input effectively decreases background bias by 3.78%. Finally, we explore manual and automated prompt tuning for VLLMs, demonstrating that prompt design can steer predictions towards human-focused reasoning by 9.85%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshops: SPACE in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI; and What Makes a Good Video: Next Practices in Video Generation and Evaluation</p></details> | None |

RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StegaVAR: Privacy-Preserving Video Action Recognition via Steganographic Domain Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12586v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of deep learning in video action recognition (VAR) in recent years, privacy leakage in videos remains a critical concern. Current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods often rely on anonymization. These methods suffer from (1) low concealment, where producing visually distorted videos that attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption, where degrading essential spatiotemporal features for accurate VAR. To address these issues, we propose StegaVAR, a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and directly performs VAR in the steganographic domain for the first time. Throughout both data transmission and action analysis, the spatiotemporal information of hidden secret video remains complete, while the natural appearance of cover videos ensures the concealment of transmission. Considering the difficulty of steganographic domain analysis, we propose Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) for analysis within the steganographic domain. STeP uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction in the steganographic domain during training. CroDA suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences. Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. Moreover, our framework is effective for multiple steganographic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures.

| **[DynaPURLS: Dynamic Refinement of Part-aware Representations for Skeleton-based Zero-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11941v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition (ZS-SAR) is fundamentally constrained by prevailing approaches that rely on aligning skeleton features with static, class-level semantics. This coarse-grained alignment fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, thereby impeding the effective transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records.

| **[TSkel-Mamba: Temporal Dynamic Modeling via State Space Model for Human Skeleton-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11503v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition has garnered significant attention in the computer vision community. Inspired by the recent success of the selective state-space model (SSM) Mamba in modeling 1D temporal sequences, we propose TSkel-Mamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba framework that effectively captures both spatial and temporal dynamics. In particular, our approach leverages Spatial Transformer for spatial feature learning while utilizing Mamba for temporal modeling. Mamba, however, employs separate SSM blocks for individual channels, which inherently limits its ability to model inter-channel dependencies. To better adapt Mamba for skeleton data and enhance Mamba`s ability to model temporal dependencies, we introduce a Temporal Dynamic Modeling (TDM) block, which is a versatile plug-and-play component that integrates a novel Multi-scale Temporal Interaction (MTI) module. The MTI module employs multi-scale Cycle operators to capture cross-channel temporal interactions, a critical factor in action recognition. Extensive experiments on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA and UAV-Human datasets demonstrate that TSkel-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low inference time, making it both efficient and highly effective.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Skeleton-based Zero-Shot Action Recognition with Training-Free Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11458v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Alchemist0754/Skeleton-Cache.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Alchemist0754/Skeleton-Cache) |
| **[Task-Specific Distance Correlation Matching for Few-Shot Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11340v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has recently made notable progress through set matching and efficient adaptation of large-scale pre-trained models. However, two key limitations persist. First, existing set matching metrics typically rely on cosine similarity to measure inter-frame linear dependencies and then perform matching with only instance-level information, thus failing to capture more complex patterns such as nonlinear relationships and overlooking task-specific cues. Second, for efficient adaptation of CLIP to FSAR, recent work performing fine-tuning via skip-fusion layers (which we refer to as side layers) has significantly reduced memory cost. However, the newly introduced side layers are often difficult to optimize under limited data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose TS-FSAR, a framework comprising three components: (1) a visual Ladder Side Network (LSN) for efficient CLIP fine-tuning; (2) a metric called Task-Specific Distance Correlation Matching (TS-DCM), which uses $α$-distance correlation to model both linear and nonlinear inter-frame dependencies and leverages a task prototype to enable task-specific matching; and (3) a Guiding LSN with Adapted CLIP (GLAC) module, which regularizes LSN using the adapted frozen CLIP to improve training for better $α$-distance correlation estimation under limited supervision. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our TS-FSAR yields superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages. 4 figures, conference</p></details> | None |

The hardware overhead of commonly adopted VR-based mHealth solutions further hinders their widespread clinical application. Therefore, we developed Breast-Rehab, a novel, low-cost mHealth system to provide patients with out-of-hospital upper limb rehabilitation management. Breast-Rehab integrates a bespoke human action recognition algorithm with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. By fusing visual and 3D skeletal data, our model accurately segments exercise videos recorded in uncontrolled home environments, outperforming standard models. These segmented clips, combined with a domain-specific knowledge base, guide a multi-modal large language model to generate clinically relevant assessment reports. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead and mitigates model hallucinations. We implemented the system as a WeChat Mini Program and a nurse-facing dashboard. A preliminary clinical study validated the system's feasibility and user acceptance, with patients achieving an average exercise frequency of 0.59 sessions/day over a two-week period. This work thus presents a complete, validated pipeline for AI-driven, at-home rehabilitation monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted by CHIP 2025</p></details> | None |

Unlike prior work focusing on human motion or video synthesis, we generate explicit trajectories for arbitrary objects using motion extracted from real-world videos via point tracking. Our transformer-based auto-encoder learns trajectory representations through dual supervision: textual motion descriptions and rendered trajectory visualizations, both mapped through CLIP's frozen encoders. Lang2Motion achieves 34.2% Recall@1 on text-to-trajectory retrieval, outperforming video-based methods by 12.5 points, and improves motion accuracy by 33-52% (12.4 ADE vs 18.3-25.3) compared to video generation baselines. We demonstrate 88.3% Top-1 accuracy on human action recognition despite training only on diverse object motions, showing effective transfer across motion domains. Lang2Motion supports style transfer, semantic interpolation, and latent-space editing through CLIP-aligned trajectory representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improving action classification with brain-inspired deep networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07729v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is also key for applications ranging from robotics to healthcare monitoring. Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants.</p></details> |  | None |

Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn). CUHK-X aims to enable the community to apply and develop data-intensive learning methods for robust, multimodal human activity analysis.

Accurate identification of the types of IoT devices and their associated actions through network traffic analysis is essential to mitigate potential threats. By monitoring and analysing packet flows between IoT devices and connected networks, anomalous or malicious behaviours can be detected. Existing research focuses primarily on device identification within local networks using methods such as protocol fingerprinting and wireless frequency scanning. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to monitor or classify IoT devices externally. To address this gap, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), in conjunction with targeted network traffic monitoring to classify IoT device types and their actions. We constructed a testbed comprising an NPAT-enabled router and a diverse set of IoT devices, including smart cameras, controller hubs, home appliances, power controllers, and streaming devices. Experimental results demonstrate that IoT device and action recognition is feasible using our proposed ML-driven approach, with the RF classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 91%, while the MLP recorded the lowest accuracy at 56%. Notably, all device categories were successfully classified except for certain actions associated with security cameras, underscoring both the potential and the limitations of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figures, conference</p></details> | None |

This approach uses attention to connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens, enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation.

However, they often rely on dominant, dataset-specific action sequences rather than true video comprehension, a problem that we define as ordinal bias. To address this issue, we propose two effective video manipulation methods: Action Masking, which masks frames of frequently co-occurring actions, and Sequence Shuffling, which randomizes the order of action segments. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that current models exhibit significant performance drops when confronted with nonstandard action sequences, underscoring their vulnerability to ordinal bias. Our findings emphasize the importance of rethinking evaluation strategies and developing models capable of generalizing beyond fixed action patterns in diverse instructional videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SCSL @ ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

To the best of our knowledge, no prior work in SE research has systematically examined this group, despite increasing recognition of neurodiversity in the workplace. Underdiagnosis, masking, and male-centric workplace cultures continue to exacerbate barriers that contribute to stress, burnout, and attrition. In response, we propose a hybrid methodological approach that integrates InclusiveMag's inclusivity framework with the GenderMag walkthrough process, tailored to the context of neurodivergent women in SE. The overarching design unfolds across three stages, scoping through literature review, deriving personas and analytic processes, and applying the method in collaborative workshops. We present a targeted literature review that synthesize challenges into cognitive, social, organizational, structural and career progression challenges neurodivergent women face in SE, including how under/late diagnosis and masking intensify exclusion. These findings lay the groundwork for subsequent stages that will develop and apply inclusive analytic methods to support actionable change.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose an efficient approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active objects upon confirmed interaction.

We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active object.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, In International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing</p></details> | None |

Employing gating mechanisms for multimodal fusion, we aim to surpass limitations inherent in traditional unimodal recognition methods while exploring novel possibilities for diverse applications. Through an exhaustive investigation of gating mechanisms and adaptive weighting-based fusion architectures, our methodology enables the selective integration of relevant information from various modalities, thereby bolstering both accuracy and robustness in action recognition tasks. We meticulously examine various gated fusion strategies to pinpoint the most effective approach for multimodal action recognition, showcasing its superiority over conventional unimodal methods. Gating mechanisms facilitate the extraction of pivotal features, resulting in a more holistic representation of actions and substantial enhancements in recognition performance. Our evaluations across human action recognition, violence action detection, and multiple self-supervised learning tasks on benchmark datasets demonstrate promising advancements in accuracy. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize action recognition systems across diverse fields. The fusion of multimodal information promises sophisticated applications in surveillance and human-computer interaction, especially in contexts related to active assisted living.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing PES models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as the Gate Shift Module (GSM) or the Gate Shift Fuse to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability. We propose Multi-Focus Temporal Shifting Module (MFS) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal shifts and Group Focus Module, enabling efficient modeling of both short and long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MFS is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates seamlessly with diverse 2D backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis Australia dataset, the first PES benchmark for table tennis containing over 4,800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES benchmarks demonstrate that MFS consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, achieving leading results among lightweight methods (+4.09 mAP, 45 GFLOPs).</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

Nevertheless, existing methods for extracting deep features from RGB videos face challenges such as information redundancy, susceptibility to noise and high storage costs. To address these issues and fully harness the useful information in videos, we propose a novel heatmap pooling network (HP-Net) for action recognition from videos, which extracts information-rich, robust and concise pooled features of the human body in videos through a feedback pooling module. The extracted pooled features demonstrate obvious performance advantages over the previously obtained pose data and heatmap features from videos. In addition, we design a spatial-motion co-learning module and a text refinement modulation module to integrate the extracted pooled features with other multimodal data, enabling more robust action recognition. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Toyota-Smarthome and UAV-Human consistently verify the effectiveness of our HP-Net, which outperforms the existing human action recognition methods.

Existing action-centric methods struggle with the flexibility of real procedures, where step order varies depending on object states. In this work, we propose to shift the focus to an object-centric paradigm by regarding actions as mechanisms that drive state transitions. To advance this direction, we introduce Object-IVQA, a long-form instructional video benchmark with 107 videos and 514 open-ended question-answer pairs annotated with temporally grounded evidence. The benchmark evaluates four dimensions of object-centric reasoning, including state evolution, precondition verification, counterfactual reasoning and mistake recognition. We further propose an agent framework that orchestrates object-centric planning, perception, analysis and generation tools, enabling explicit evidence retrieval and multi-hop reasoning across disjoint segments. Experiments show that existing large vision-language models struggle in object-level recognition and reasoning, whereas our framework achieves substantially improvement.</p></details> |  | None |

Skeleton data are typically transmitted to cloud servers for action recognition, with results returned to clients via Apps/APIs. However, the vulnerability of skeletal models against adversarial perturbations gradually reveals the unreliability of these systems. Existing black-box attacks all operate in a decision-based manner, resulting in numerous queries that hinder efficiency and feasibility in real-world applications. Moreover, all attacks off the shelf focus on only restricted perturbations, while ignoring model weaknesses when encountered with non-semantic perturbations. In this paper, we propose two query-effIcient Skeletal Adversarial AttaCks, ISAAC-K and ISAAC-N. As a black-box attack, ISAAC-K utilizes Grad-CAM in a surrogate model to extract key joints where minor sparse perturbations are then added to fool the classifier. To guarantee natural adversarial motions, we introduce constraints of both bone length and temporal consistency. ISAAC-K finds stronger adversarial examples on the $\ell_\infty$ norm, which can encompass those on other norms. Exhaustive experiments substantiate that ISAAC-K can uplift the attack efficiency of the perturbations under 10 skeletal models. Additionally, as a byproduct, ISAAC-N fools the classifier by replacing skeletons unrelated to the action. We surprisingly find that skeletal models are vulnerable to large perturbations where the part-wise non-semantic joints are just replaced, leading to a query-free no-box attack without any prior knowledge. Based on that, four adaptive defenses are eventually proposed to improve the robustness of skeleton recognition models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (TIFS)</p></details> | None |

However, current methods face fundamental challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control of LLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text Mining Analysis of Symptom Patterns in Medical Chatbot Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00768v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fast growth of digital health systems has led to a need to better comprehend how they interpret and represent patient-reported symptoms. Chatbots have been used in healthcare to provide clinical support and enhance the user experience, making it possible to provide meaningful clinical patterns from text-based data through chatbots. The proposed research utilises several different natural language processing methods to study the occurrences of symptom descriptions in medicine as well as analyse the patterns that emerge through these conversations within medical bots. Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology. By demonstrating a method for converting unstructured free-flowing dialogue into actionable knowledge regarding symptoms this work provides an extensible framework to further enhance future performance, dependability and clinical utility of selecting medical chatbots.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 tables | None |

Automated yoga pose classification has therefore gained importance to reduce reliance on expert practitioners. While human pose keypoint extraction models have shown high potential in action recognition, systematic benchmarking for yoga pose recognition remains limited, as prior works often focus solely on raw images or a single pose extraction model. In this study, we introduce a curated dataset, 'Yoga-16', which addresses limitations of existing datasets, and systematically evaluate three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception) using three input modalities (direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images). Our experiments demonstrate that skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs, with the highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Additionally, we provide interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM, offering insights into model decision-making for yoga pose classification with cross validation analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Although Action Units (AUs) have long served as the foundation of affective computing, existing approaches rarely address how to infer psychologically plausible causal relations between AUs and expressions directly from data. We propose CausalAffect, the first framework for causal graph discovery in facial affect analysis. CausalAffect models AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies through a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy that integrates population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures. A feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanism further enforces true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations. Crucially, our approach requires neither jointly annotated datasets nor handcrafted causal priors, yet it recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that CausalAffect advances the state of the art in both AU detection and expression recognition, establishing a principled connection between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior. All trained models and source code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

SynPlay departs from traditional synthetic datasets by addressing a critical but underexplored challenge: localizing humans in aerial scenes where subjects often occupy only tens of pixels in the image. In such scenarios, fine-grained details like facial features or textures become irrelevant, shifting the burden of recognition to human motion, behavior, and interactions. To meet this need, SynPlay implements a novel rule-guided motion generation framework that combines real-world motion capture with motion evolution graphs. This design enables human actions to evolve dynamically through high-level game rules rather than predefined scripts, resulting in effectively uncountable motion variations. Unlike existing synthetic datasets-which either focus on static visual traits or reuse a limited set of mocap-driven actions-SynPlay captures a wide spectrum of spontaneous behaviors, including complex interactions that naturally emerge from unscripted gameplay scenarios. SynPlay also introduces an extensive multi-camera setup that spans UAVs at random altitudes, CCTVs, and a freely roaming UGV, achieving true near-to-far perspective coverage in a single dataset. The majority of instances are captured from aerial viewpoints at varying scales, directly supporting the development of models for long-range human analysis-a setting where existing datasets fall short. Our data contains over 73k images and 6.5M human instances, with detailed annotations for detection, segmentation, and keypoint tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with SynPlay significantly improves human localization performance, especially in few-shot and data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://synplaydataset.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Experiments on three diverse video datasets - EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition) with multiple target models covering both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that LD-ViCE generalizes well and achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, LD-ViCE achieves significantly higher regression accuracy than prior methods and exhibits high temporal consistency, while the refinement stage further improves perceptual quality. Qualitative analyses confirm that LD-ViCE produces semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, providing actionable insights into model behavior. LD-ViCE advances the trustworthiness and interpretability of video-based AI systems through visually coherent counterfactual explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review CVPR 2026 (44 Pages)</p></details> | None |
| **[SkeletonAgent: An Agentic Interaction Framework for Skeleton-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22433v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition increasingly leverage semantic priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich skeletal representations. However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues.

This work explores AI-driven analysis of classroom recordings, focusing on multimodal instructional activity and discourse recognition as a foundation for actionable feedback. Using a densely annotated dataset of 164 hours of video and 68 lesson transcripts, we design parallel, modality-specific pipelines. For video, we evaluate zero-shot multimodal LLMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, and self-supervised video transformers on 24 activity labels. For transcripts, we fine-tune a transformer-based classifier with contextualized inputs and compare it against prompting-based LLMs on 19 discourse labels. To handle class imbalance and multi-label complexity, we apply per-label thresholding, context windows, and imbalance-aware loss functions. The results show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform prompting-based approaches, achieving macro-F1 scores of 0.577 for video and 0.460 for transcripts. These results demonstrate the feasibility of automated classroom analysis and establish a foundation for scalable teacher feedback systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> | None |

To do this, video understanding models must be able to obtain structured understandings, such as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actions and skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel environments, tasks, and problem domains. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1) step recognition and (2) video question answering, over a dataset of temporally segmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk recordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to: (1) generalize to novel domains; (2) utilize long temporal context and multimodal (e.g. visual and speech) information. Our extensive experimental analysis highlights the challenges of Spacewalk-18, but also suggests best practices for domain generalization and long-form understanding. Notably, we discover a promising adaptation via summarization technique that leads to significant performance improvement without model fine-tuning. The Spacewalk-18 benchmark is released at https://brown-palm.github.io/Spacewalk-18/.</p></details> | WACV 2026 | [Code Link](https://brown-palm.github.io/Spacewalk-18) |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards an Effective Action-Region Tracking Framework for Fine-grained Video Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21202v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper explores these issues through the lens of Meursault, the protagonist of Albert Camus' The Stranger, whose emotionally detached existence epitomizes the existential concept of absurdity. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including emotion detection (BERT), sentiment analysis (VADER), and named entity recognition (spaCy)-this study quantifies key events and behaviors in Meursault's life. Our analysis reveals the inherent limitations of applying algorithmic models to complex human experiences, particularly those rooted in existential alienation and moral ambiguity. By examining how modern AI tools misinterpret Meursault's actions and emotions, this research underscores the broader ethical dilemmas of reducing nuanced human narratives to data points, challenging the foundational assumptions of our data-driven society. The findings presented in this paper serve as a critique of the increasing reliance on data-driven narratives and advocate for incorporating humanistic values in artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> | None |

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

| **[Beyond Realism: Learning the Art of Expressive Composition with StickerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20957v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ENACT: Evaluating Embodied Cognition with World Modeling of Egocentric Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20937v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency - capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce an evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks - action recognition and character recognition - each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a VLM-based evaluator for video world model rollouts adapted under data and compute constraints. In our extensive experiments totaling over 5,154 GPU-days, we explore full, partial, and parameter-efficient adaptation methods across various task formats, context lengths, sampling methods, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator achieves parity with task-specific checkpoints. Human studies across seven diverse environments confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a lightweight, adaptable, and semantics-aware evaluator for video world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS LAW 2025 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interaction underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and grounded embodied agents.</p></details> |  | None |

In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.</p></details> | 18 pages | None |

A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured. Extensive experiments, conducted on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets, show the effectiveness and the outperformance of our label-frugal GCNs against the related work.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101 -- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight paper.

The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module. Our proposed model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings, achieving up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods concentrate primarily on full-body movements and often overlook subtle hand motions that are critical for distinguishing fine-grained actions. Recent work leverages a unified graph representation that combines body, hand, and foot keypoints to capture detailed body dynamics. Yet, these models often blur fine hand details due to the disparity between body and hand action characteristics and the loss of subtle features during the spatial-pooling. In this paper, we propose BHaRNet (Body-Hand action Recognition Network), a novel framework that augments a typical body-expert model with a hand-expert model. Our model jointly trains both streams with an ensemble loss that fosters cooperative specialization, functioning in a manner reminiscent of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Moreover, cross-attention is employed via an expertized branch method and a pooling-attention module to enable feature-level interactions and selectively fuse complementary information. Inspired by MMNet, we also demonstrate the applicability of our approach to multi-modal tasks by leveraging RGB information, where body features guide RGB learning to capture richer contextual cues. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks (NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, and Northwestern-UCLA) demonstrate that BHaRNet achieves SOTA accuracies -- improving from 86.4\% to 93.0\% in hand-intensive actions -- while maintaining fewer GFLOPs and parameters than the relevant unified methods.</p></details> | 7 figures, 8 pages | None |

The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper evaluates a wide range of pose forecasting algorithms in the task of absolute pose forecasting, revealing many reproducibility issues, and provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline. After drawing a high-level analogy to the task of speech understanding, it is shown that recent speech models can be efficiently adapted to the task of pose forecasting, and improve current state-of-the-art performance. At last the robustness of the models is evaluated, using noisy joint coordinates obtained from a pose estimator model, to reflect a realistic type of noise, which is more close to real-world applications. For this a new dataset variation is introduced, and it is shown that estimated poses result in a substantial performance degradation, and how much of it can be recovered again by unsupervised finetuning.</p></details> |  | None |

Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%. Grounding generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity and yields clinician-verifiable rationales, supporting auditable use in surgical training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as proceedings paper for ML4H 2025</p></details> | None |

The reliance on high-energy-consuming continuous floating-point operations inherent in GCN-based methods poses significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained, battery-powered edge devices. To address these limitations, MK-SGN, a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation, is proposed to leverage the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for skeleton-based action recognition for the first time. By integrating the energy-saving properties of SNNs with the graph representation capabilities of GCNs, MK-SGN achieves significant reductions in energy consumption while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy. Firstly, we formulate a Spiking Multimodal Fusion (SMF) module to effectively fuse multimodal skeleton data represented as spike-form features. Secondly, we propose the Self-Attention Spiking Graph Convolution (SA-SGC) module and the Spiking Temporal Convolution (STC) module, to capture spatial relationships and temporal dynamics of spike-form features. Finally, we propose an integrated knowledge distillation strategy to transfer information from the multimodal GCN to the SGN, incorporating both intermediate-layer distillation and soft-label distillation to enhance the performance of the SGN. MK-SGN exhibits substantial advantages, surpassing state-of-the-art GCN frameworks in energy efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art SNN frameworks in recognition accuracy. The proposed method achieves a remarkable reduction in energy consumption, exceeding 98\% compared to conventional GCN-based approaches. This research establishes a robust baseline for developing high-performance, energy-efficient SNN-based models for skeleton-based action recognition</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, journal</p></details> | None |

Recently, several hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods have been developed to generate future possible hand waypoints, which still suffer from insufficient prediction targets, inherent modality gaps, entangled hand-head motion, and limited validation in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we present a universal hand motion forecasting framework considering multi-modal input, multi-dimensional and multi-target prediction patterns, and multi-task affordances for downstream applications. We harmonize multiple modalities by vision-language fusion, global context incorporation, and task-aware text embedding injection, to forecast hand waypoints in both 2D and 3D spaces. A novel dual-branch diffusion is proposed to concurrently predict human head and hand movements, capturing their motion synergy in egocentric vision. By introducing target indicators, the prediction model can forecast the specific joint waypoints of the wrist or the fingers, besides the widely studied hand center points. In addition, we enable Uni-Hand to additionally predict hand-object interaction states (contact/separation) to facilitate downstream tasks better. As the first work to incorporate downstream task evaluation in the literature, we build novel benchmarks to assess the real-world applicability of hand motion forecasting algorithms. The experimental results on multiple publicly available datasets and our newly proposed benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-Hand achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multi-dimensional and multi-target hand motion forecasting. Extensive validation in multiple downstream tasks also presents its impressive human-robot policy transfer to enable robotic manipulation, and effective feature enhancement for action anticipation/recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended journal version of MMTwin (IROS'25)</p></details> | None |

Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.</p></details> |  | None |

Caregiving tasks involve complex physical human-robot interactions, requiring precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning. While recent advances in robot learning from demonstrations have shown promise, there is a lack of a large-scale, diverse, and expert-driven dataset that captures real-world caregiving routines. To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

| **[Computer Vision based group activity detection and action spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13315v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group activity detection in multi-person scenes is challenging due to complex human interactions, occlusions, and variations in appearance over time. This work presents a computer vision based framework for group activity recognition and action spotting using a combination of deep learning models and graph based relational reasoning. The system first applies Mask R-CNN to obtain accurate actor localization through bounding boxes and instance masks. Multiple backbone networks, including Inception V3, MobileNet, and VGG16, are used to extract feature maps, and RoIAlign is applied to preserve spatial alignment when generating actor specific features. The mask information is then fused with the feature maps to obtain refined masked feature representations for each actor. To model interactions between individuals, we construct Actor Relation Graphs that encode appearance similarity and positional relations using methods such as normalized cross correlation, sum of absolute differences, and dot product. Graph Convolutional Networks operate on these graphs to reason about relationships and predict both individual actions and group level activities. Experiments on the Collective Activity dataset demonstrate that the combination of mask based feature refinement, robust similarity search, and graph neural network reasoning leads to improved recognition performance across both crowded and non crowded scenarios. This approach highlights the potential of integrating segmentation, feature extraction, and relational graph reasoning for complex video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MGCA-Net: Multi-Grained Category-Aware Network for Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13039v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization (OV-TAL) aims to recognize and localize instances of any desired action categories in videos without explicitly curating training data for all categories. Existing methods mostly recognize action categories at a single granularity, which degrades the recognition accuracy of both base and novel action categories. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Grained Category-Aware Network (MGCA-Net) comprising a localizer, an action presence predictor, a conventional classifier, and a coarse-to-fine classifier. Specifically, the localizer localizes category-agnostic action proposals. For these action proposals, the action presence predictor estimates the probability that they belong to an action instance. At the same time, the conventional classifier predicts the probability of each action proposal over base action categories at the snippet granularity. Novel action categories are recognized by the coarse-to-fine classifier, which first identifies action presence at the video granularity. Finally, it assigns each action proposal to one category from the coarse categories at the proposal granularity. Through coarse-to-fine category awareness for novel actions and the conventional classifier's awareness of base actions, multi-grained category awareness is achieved, effectively enhancing localization performance. Comprehensive evaluations on the THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our MGCA-Net achieves state-of-the-art results under the Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization setting.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[View-aware Cross-modal Distillation for Multi-view Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12870v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of multi-sensor systems has increased research in multi-view action recognition. While existing approaches in multi-view setups with fully overlapping sensors benefit from consistent view coverage, partially overlapping settings where actions are visible in only a subset of views remain underexplored. This challenge becomes more severe in real-world scenarios, as many systems provide only limited input modalities and rely on sequence-level annotations instead of dense frame-level labels. In this study, we propose View-aware Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ViCoKD), a framework that distills knowledge from a fully supervised multi-modal teacher to a modality- and annotation-limited student. ViCoKD employs a cross-modal adapter with cross-modal attention, allowing the student to exploit multi-modal correlations while operating with incomplete modalities. Moreover, we propose a View-aware Consistency module to address view misalignment, where the same action may appear differently or only partially across viewpoints. It enforces prediction alignment when the action is co-visible across views, guided by human-detection masks and confidence-weighted Jensen-Shannon divergence between their predicted class distributions. Experiments on the real-world MultiSensor-Home dataset show that ViCoKD consistently outperforms competitive distillation methods across multiple backbones and environments, delivering significant gains and surpassing the teacher model under limited conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> | None |

Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the locomotion methods in the CAVE are limited by unnatural interaction methods, severely hindering the user experience and immersion in the CAVE. We proposed a locomotion framework for CAVE environments aimed at enhancing the immersive locomotion experience through optimized human motion recognition technology. Firstly, we construct a four-sided display CAVE system, then through the dynamic method based on Perspective-n-Point to calibrate the camera, using the obtained camera intrinsics and extrinsic parameters, and an action recognition architecture to get the action category. At last, transform the action category to a graphical workstation that renders display effects on the screen. We designed a user study to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to the traditional methods, our method has significant improvements in realness and self-presence in the virtual environment, effectively reducing motion sickness.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning-based driver activity recognition methods have shown promise in detecting such distractions, their effectiveness in real-world deployments is hindered by two critical challenges: variations in camera viewpoints (cross-view) and domain shifts such as change in sensor modality or environment. Existing methods typically address either cross-view generalization or unsupervised domain adaptation in isolation, leaving a gap in the robust and scalable deployment of models across diverse vehicle configurations. In this work, we propose a novel two-phase cross-view, cross-modal unsupervised domain adaptation framework that addresses these challenges jointly on real-time driver monitoring data. In the first phase, we learn view-invariant and action-discriminative features within a single modality using contrastive learning on multi-view data. In the second phase, we perform domain adaptation to a new modality using information bottleneck loss without requiring any labeled data from the new domain. We evaluate our approach using state-of-the art video transformers (Video Swin, MViT) and multi modal driver activity dataset called Drive&Act, demonstrating that our joint framework improves top-1 accuracy on RGB video data by almost 50% compared to a supervised contrastive learning-based cross-view method, and outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation-only methods by up to 5%, using the same video transformer backbone.</p></details> |  | None |

Recognizing actions in videos requires both spatial and temporal understanding, yet most existing models lack a balanced spatio-temporal understanding of videos. To address this, we propose a novel two-stream architecture, called Cross-Attention in Space and Time (CAST), using only RGB input. In each layer of CAST, Bottleneck Cross-Attention (B-CA) enables spatial and temporal experts to exchange information and make synergistic predictions. For holistic video understanding, we extend CAST by integrating an audio expert, forming Cross-Attention in Visual and Audio (CAVA). We validate the CAST on benchmarks with different characteristics, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Something-Something-V2, and Kinetics-400, consistently showing balanced performance. We also validate the CAVA on audio-visual action recognition benchmarks, including UCF-101, VGG-Sound, KineticsSound, and EPIC-SOUNDS. With a favorable performance of CAVA across these datasets, we demonstrate the effective information exchange among multiple experts within the B-CA module. In summary, CA^2ST combines CAST and CAVA by employing spatial, temporal, and audio experts through cross-attention, achieving balanced and holistic video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our paper has been accepted to IEEE TPAMI</p></details> | None |

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> | None |

Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.</p></details> |  | None |

With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance.

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations. Extensive experiments across eight standard benchmarks demonstrate that Facial-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in FEA, with strong generalization and robust interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026. 16 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables</p></details> | None |

In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR. Moreover, experiments on zero-shot scenarios show that SUGAR is more versatile than linear-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Main Track</p></details> | None |

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2 $mm$ MPJPE and 112.6 $mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Preprint), 45 pages, 29 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Revisiting Cross-Architecture Distillation: Adaptive Dual-Teacher Transfer for Lightweight Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09469v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.</p></details> | 2 figures, 7 tables | None |
| **[Learning by Neighbor-Aware Semantics, Deciding by Open-form Flows: Towards Robust Zero-Shot Skeleton Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09388v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

| **[Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Here, we propose a tactile-encoded BCI that leverages sensory afferents through a novel tactile-evoked P300 paradigm, allowing intuitive and reliable decoding of supernumerary motor intentions even when superimposed with voluntary actions. The interface was evaluated in a multi-day experiment comprising of a single motor recognition task to validate baseline BCI performance and a dual task paradigm to assess the potential influence between the BCI and natural human movement. The brain interface achieved real-time and reliable decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom, with significant performance improvements after only three days of training. Importantly, after training, performance did not differ significantly between the single- and dual-BCI task conditions, and natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control. Lastly, the interface was deployed in a movement augmentation task, demonstrating its ability to command two supernumerary robotic arms for functional assistance during bimanual tasks. These results establish a new neural interface paradigm for movement augmentation through stimulation of sensory afferents, expanding motor degrees of freedom without impairing natural movement.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Planned Event Forecasting using Future Mentions and Related Entity Extraction in News Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07879v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In democracies like India, people are free to express their views and demands. Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format. In this paper, we have developed a geographically independent, generalized model to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events. There could be many mentions of entities, but only a few may actually be involved in the event. This paper calls such entities Related Entities and proposes a method to extract them, referred to as Related Entity Extraction.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Otter: Mitigating Background Distractions of Wide-Angle Few-Shot Action Recognition with Enhanced RWKV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06741v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wide-angle videos in few-shot action recognition (FSAR) effectively express actions within specific scenarios. However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Oral</p></details> | None |

Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents -- virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.

Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes. Our findings emphasize a need for action recognition to be supported by spatial understanding instead of statistical pattern recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 SpaVLE, for code see https://github.com/nbabey20/groundactrec , 9 pages, 1 figure</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/nbabey20/groundactrec) |
| **[STARS: Self-supervised Tuning for 3D Action Recognition in Skeleton Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10935v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised pretraining methods with masked prediction demonstrate remarkable within-dataset performance in skeleton-based action recognition. However, we show that, unlike contrastive learning approaches, they do not produce well-separated clusters. Additionally, these methods struggle with generalization in few-shot settings. To address these issues, we propose Self-supervised Tuning for 3D Action Recognition in Skeleton sequences (STARS). Specifically, STARS first uses a masked prediction stage using an encoder-decoder architecture. It then employs nearest-neighbor contrastive learning to partially tune the weights of the encoder, enhancing the formation of semantic clusters for different actions. By tuning the encoder for a few epochs, and without using hand-crafted data augmentations, STARS achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised results in various benchmarks, including NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD. In addition, STARS exhibits significantly better results than masked prediction models in few-shot settings, where the model has not seen the actions throughout pretraining.

Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented, especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising 2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models. Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IJCNLP-AACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> | None |
| **[Accurate online action and gesture recognition system using detectors and Deep SPD Siamese Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05250v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network. The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods tackle action recognition and dark enhancement separately, limiting the potential for end-to-end learning of spatiotemporal representations for video action classification. This paper introduces Dark Transformer, a novel video transformer-based approach for action recognition in low-light environments. Dark Transformer leverages spatiotemporal self-attention mechanisms in cross-domain settings to enhance cross-domain action recognition. By extending video transformers to learn cross-domain knowledge, Dark Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark action recognition datasets, including InFAR, XD145, and ARID. The proposed approach demonstrates significant promise in addressing the challenges of action recognition in adverse lighting conditions, offering practical implications for real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 Figures, 12 Pages | None |

Yet, the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly, 3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures | None |

However, existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101 -- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight paper.

Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets. Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D, and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we present a novel evaluation dataset, ProMQA, to measure system advancements in application-oriented scenarios. ProMQA consists of 401 multimodal procedural QA pairs on user recording of procedural activities, i.e., cooking, coupled with their corresponding instructions/recipes. For QA annotation, we take a cost-effective human-LLM collaborative approach, where the existing annotation is augmented with LLM-generated QA pairs that are later verified by humans. We then provide the benchmark results to set the baseline performance on ProMQA. Our experiment reveals a significant gap between human performance and that of current systems, including competitive proprietary multimodal models.

In this task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Selec...</summary><p>Selected as Best Industry Paper Award at ICIP2024</p></details> | None |

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains.

To achieve this, we introduce a transformer architecture tailored for action recognition that employs both visual and textual features. Visual features are obtained from RGB and optical flow data, while text embeddings represent contextual information. Furthermore, we define a joint loss function to simultaneously train the model for both coarse- and fine-grained action recognition, effectively exploiting the hierarchical nature of actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we extend the Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU) dataset by incorporating action hierarchies, resulting in the Hierarchical TSU dataset, a hierarchical dataset designed for monitoring activities of the elderly in home environments. An ablation study assesses the performance impact of different strategies for integrating contextual and hierarchical data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms SOTA methods on the Hierarchical TSU dataset, Assembly101 and IkeaASM, achieving over a 17% improvement in top-1 accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing surgical action triplet recognition methods are limited to learning from frame-level classification, failing to reliably link actions to specific instrument instances.Previous attempts at spatial grounding have primarily relied on class activation maps, which lack the precision and robustness required for detailed instrument-tissue interaction analysis.To address this gap, we propose grounding surgical action triplets with instrument instance segmentation, or triplet segmentation for short, a new unified task which produces spatially grounded  outputs.We start by presenting CholecTriplet-Seg, a large-scale dataset containing over 30,000 annotated frames, linking instrument instance masks with action verb and anatomical target annotations, and establishing the first benchmark for strongly supervised, instance-level triplet grounding and evaluation.To learn triplet segmentation, we propose TargetFusionNet, a novel architecture that extends Mask2Former with a target-aware fusion mechanism to address the challenge of accurate anatomical target prediction by fusing weak anatomy priors with instrument instance queries.Evaluated across recognition, detection, and triplet segmentation metrics, TargetFusionNet consistently improves performance over existing baselines, demonstrating that strong instance supervision combined with weak target priors significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of surgical action understanding.Triplet segmentation establishes a unified framework for spatially grounding surgical action triplets. The proposed benchmark and architecture pave the way for more interpretable, surgical scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types.

However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and 68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the model's adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Still, their reliance on floating-point computations leads to high energy consumption, limiting their applicability in battery-powered devices. While energy-efficient, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) struggle to model skeleton dynamics, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose Signal-SGN (Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which utilizes the temporal dimension of skeleton sequences as the spike time steps and represents features as multi-dimensional discrete stochastic signals for temporal-frequency domain feature extraction. It combines the 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) module and the Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) module to extract features from the skeleton represented as spiking form. Additionally, the Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Feature Fusion (MWTF) module is proposed to extract dynamic spiking features and capture frequency-specific characteristics, enhancing classification performance. Experiments across three large-scale datasets reveal Signal-SGN exceeding state-of-the-art SNN-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency while attaining comparable performance with GCN methods and significantly reducing theoretical energy consumption.</p></details> |  | None |

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion (PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters, overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result, scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen. Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR) while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains. The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge management and security operations.</p></details> |  | None |

This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models (e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition, activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to 18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review at IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2025</p></details> | None |

Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%.

| **[Informative Sample Selection Model for Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25345v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation, has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information, combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism, is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples. To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Affordance Representation and Recognition for Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24459v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations prevents agents from adapting to evolving services. This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive, and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Evaluation of Vision-LLMs in Surveillance Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23190v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding.

We analyze transcription accuracy across speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American, ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation, particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns, is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.</p></details> |  | None |

Current benchmarks oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense, layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching, element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation. Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to novel interfaces.

Operating in dynamic on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector: environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence, pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more robust and secure embodied agents.</p></details> |  | None |

This research applies advanced machine learning methods for sentiment analysis on Twitter data, with a focus on predicting consumer trends. Using the Sentiment140 dataset, the study detects evolving patterns in consumer preferences with "car" as an example. A structured workflow was used to clean and prepare data for analysis. Machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), were employed to classify sentiments and predict trends. Model performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with BERT achieving the highest results (Accuracy: 83.48%, Precision: 79.37%, Recall: 90.60%, F1: 84.61). Results show that LSTM and BERT effectively capture linguistic and contextual patterns, improving prediction accuracy and providing insights into consumer behavior. Temporal analysis revealed sentiment shifts across time, while Named Entity Recognition (NER) identified related terms and themes.

However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network (ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action recognition.</p></details> |  | None |

As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way, with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e., Something-Something V1 & V2.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Pattern Recognition.

We introduce a complete pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model, running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in real-time via the recognized actions.</p></details> |  | None |

While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through self-exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL--world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at the MICCAI2025 workshop proceedings on COLlaborative Intelligence and Autonomy in Image-guided Surgery (COLAS)</p></details> | None |

While image-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition, they lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose ActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video classification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization strength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language model (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions across multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer parameters.

This paper proposes ActLumos, a teacher-student framework that attains single-stream inference while retaining multi-stream level accuracy. The teacher consumes dual stream inputs, which include original dark frames and retinex-enhanced frames, processed by weight-shared R(2+1)D-34 backbones and fused by a Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, which dynamically re-weights the two streams at each time step, emphasising the most informative temporal segments. The teacher is also included with a supervised contrastive loss (SupCon) that sharpens class margins. The student shares the R(2+1)D-34 backbone but uses only dark frames and no fusion at test time. The student is first pre-trained with self-supervision on dark clips of both datasets without their labels and then fine-tuned with knowledge distillation from the teacher, transferring the teacher's multi-stream knowledge into a single-stream model. Under single-stream inference, the distilled student attains state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.92% (Top-1) on ARID V1.0, 88.27% on ARID V1.5, and 48.96% on Dark48. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each component, i.e., DFF in the teacher outperforms single or static fusion, knowledge distillation (KD) transfers these gains to the single-stream student, and two-view spatio-temporal SSL surpasses spatial-only or temporal-only variants without increasing inference cost.

Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results.

| **[StretchySnake: Flexible SSM Training Unlocks Action Recognition Across Spatio-Temporal Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16209v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences, whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos. Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM, which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long, complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks, StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%, with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore, our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

This is mainly due to transient features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally, like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.</p></details> | 10 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[MoCom: Motion-based Inter-MAV Visual Communication Using Event Vision and Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14770v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns, which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down), horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right, representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption, and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV communication in constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities.

Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  | None |

However, microgravity alters human motion, interactions, and visual semantics, revealing a critical gap for real-world vision systems. This presents a challenge for domain-robust video understanding in safety-critical space applications. To address this, we introduce MicroG-4M, the first benchmark for spatio-temporal and semantic understanding of human activities in microgravity. Constructed from real-world space missions and cinematic simulations, the dataset includes 4,759 clips covering 50 actions, 1,238 context-rich captions, and over 7,000 question-answer pairs on astronaut activities and scene understanding. MicroG-4M supports three core tasks: fine-grained multi-label action recognition, temporal video captioning, and visual question answering, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both spatial localization and semantic reasoning in microgravity contexts.

However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs' tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge, which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process: (1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19 leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data & Code: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ExpVid</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ExpVid) |

However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM), which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing PES models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as the Gate Shift Module (GSM) or the Gate Shift Fuse to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal shifts and channel grouped spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short and long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates seamlessly with diverse 2D backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis Australia dataset, the first PES benchmark for table tennis containing over 4,800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across four PES benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

While LLMs encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference. PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1 gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable, high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach couples masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii) visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we address the data-limited action understanding problem by bridging data scarcity. We propose a novel method that employs a text-to-video diffusion transformer to generate annotated data for model training. This paradigm enables the generation of realistic annotated data on an infinite scale without human intervention. We proposed the information enhancement strategy and the uncertainty-based label smoothing tailored to generate sample training. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we observed that real samples generally contain a richer level of information than generated samples. Based on this observation, the information enhancement strategy is proposed to enhance the informative content of the generated samples from two aspects: the environments and the characters. Furthermore, we observed that some low-quality generated samples might negatively affect model training. To address this, we devised the uncertainty-based label smoothing strategy to increase the smoothing of these samples, thus reducing their impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on four datasets across five tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot action recognition.</p></details> | IJCAI2025 | None |

For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding.

In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose KeyScore, a caption-aware frame scoring method that combines three complementary signals: semantic similarity to captions, temporal representativeness, and contextual drop impact. Applied to large-scale video-caption datasets, KeyScore generates frame-level importance scores that enable training keyframe extractors or guiding video-language models. To support this, we also propose STACFP, a Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering method that generates diverse and compact frame proposals across long videos. Together, KeyScore and STACFP reduce uninformative frames while preserving critical content, resulting in faster and more accurate inference. Our experiments on three standard video-language benchmarks (MSRVTT, MSVD, DiDeMo) show that combining STACFP and KeyScore enables up to 99% frame reduction compared to full-frame processing, while outperforming uniform 8-frame encoders in video-text retrieval, keyframe extraction, and action recognition tasks. By focusing on semantically relevant frames, our method enhances both efficiency and performance, enabling scalable and caption-grounded video understanding.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures | None |

Most production applications were never designed with speech in mind. This article provides a concrete architecture that enables GUIs to interface with LLM-based speech-enabled assistants. The architecture makes an application's navigation graph and semantics available through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The ViewModel, part of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, exposes the application's capabilities to the assistant by supplying both tools applicable to a currently visible view and application-global tools extracted from the GUI tree router. This architecture facilitates full voice accessibility while ensuring reliable alignment between spoken input and the visual interface, accompanied by consistent feedback across modalities. It future-proofs apps for upcoming OS super assistants that employ computer use agents (CUAs) and natively consume MCP if an application provides it. To address concerns about privacy and data security, the practical effectiveness of locally deployable, open-weight LLMs for speech-enabled multimodal UIs is evaluated. Findings suggest that recent smaller open-weight models approach the performance of leading proprietary models in overall accuracy and require enterprise-grade hardware for fast responsiveness.

Existing models often fall short in offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks, while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios. Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale, general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination. Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent robustness and generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet existing 3D human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale, Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12 everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14 interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object 3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.</p></details> |  | None |

An evaluation of data scaling in Kinyarwanda and Kikuyu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07221v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for low-resource African languages remains challenging due to limited transcribed speech data. While recent advances in large multilingual models like OpenAI's Whisper offer promising pathways for low-resource ASR development, critical questions persist regarding practical deployment requirements. This paper addresses two fundamental concerns for practitioners: determining the minimum data volumes needed for viable performance and characterizing the primary failure modes that emerge in production systems. We evaluate Whisper's performance through comprehensive experiments on two Bantu languages: systematic data scaling analysis on Kinyarwanda using training sets from 1 to 1,400 hours, and detailed error characterization on Kikuyu using 270 hours of training data. Our scaling experiments demonstrate that practical ASR performance (WER < 13\%) becomes achievable with as little as 50 hours of training data, with substantial improvements continuing through 200 hours (WER < 10\%). Complementing these volume-focused findings, our error analysis reveals that data quality issues, particularly noisy ground truth transcriptions, account for 38.6\% of high-error cases, indicating that careful data curation is as critical as data volume for robust system performance. These results provide actionable benchmarks and deployment guidance for teams developing ASR systems across similar low-resource language contexts.

Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

In the multivariate time series domain, existing approaches often produce counterfactuals that lack validity, plausibility, or intuitive interpretability. We present \textbf{GenFacts}, a novel generative framework for producing plausible and actionable counterfactual explanations for time series classifiers. GenFacts introduces a structured approach to latent space modeling and targeted counterfactual synthesis. We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture recognition as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts consistently outperforms baseline methods in plausibility metrics (+18.7\%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in user studies. These results underscore that realism and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are vital for actionable counterfactuals in time series applications.</p></details> | 4 pages | None |

However, these datasets are often heavily imbalanced, with rare actions and tools under-represented, which limits the robustness of downstream models. We address this challenge with $SurgiFlowVid$, a sparse and controllable video diffusion framework for generating surgical videos of under-represented classes. Our approach introduces a dual-prediction diffusion module that jointly denoises RGB frames and optical flow, providing temporal inductive biases to improve motion modeling from limited samples. In addition, a sparse visual encoder conditions the generation process on lightweight signals (e.g., sparse segmentation masks or RGB frames), enabling controllability without dense annotations. We validate our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction. Synthetic data generated by our method yields consistent gains of 10-20% over competitive baselines, establishing $SurgiFlowVid$ as a promising strategy to mitigate data imbalance and advance surgical video understanding methods.</p></details> | 29 pages, 16 figures | None |

With the increasing availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D 120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3% accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing, outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Multimodal Graph-Based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15192v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships. These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions, allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust and generalizable action recognition.</p></details> |  | None |

While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, under submission</p></details> | None |

A central obstacle in modeling these interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from 3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable, accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)</p></details> | None |

Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

However, these systems also introduce unique challenges, particularly in maintaining software quality and performance. Among these challenges, Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) has emerged as a growing concern, significantly impacting the maintainability and overall quality of ML and DL-enabled systems. Despite its critical implications, the lifecycle of DL-specific SATD, how developers introduce, acknowledge, and address it over time-remains underexplored. This study presents a preliminary analysis of the persistence and lifecycle of DL-specific SATD in DL-enabled systems. The purpose of this project is to uncover the patterns of SATD introduction, recognition, and durability during the development life cycle, providing information on how to manage these issues. Using mining software repository techniques, we examined 40 ML projects, focusing on 185 DL-specific SATD instances. The analysis tracked the introduction and persistence of SATD instances through project commit histories to assess their lifecycle and developer actions. The findings indicate that DL-specific SATD is predominantly introduced during the early and middle stages of project development. Training and Hardware phases showed the longest SATD durations, highlighting critical areas where debt accumulates and persists. Additionally, developers introduce DL-specific SATD more frequently during feature implementation and bug fixes. This study emphasizes the need for targeted DL-specific SATD management strategies in DL-enabled systems to mitigate its impact. By understanding the temporal characteristics and evolution of DL-specific SATD, developers can prioritize interventions at critical stages to improve the maintainability and quality of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Workshop of Software Quality Assurance for Artificial Intelligence 2025 (SQA4AI), Montréal, Canada</p></details> | None |

Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between explainable AI and sports biomechanics.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000 vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and (3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation reporting with video timestamping.

Experiments on the FR-FS dataset demonstrate that Gate-Shift-Pose significantly outperforms the RGB-only baseline, improving accuracy by up to 40% with ResNet18 and 20% with ResNet50. Early-fusion achieves the highest accuracy (98.08%) with ResNet50, leveraging the model's capacity for effective multimodal integration, while late-fusion is better suited for lighter backbones like ResNet18.

To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals, and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of 1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6 types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics: multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions. Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting.

While several echocardiography-specific FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions, high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs. CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional, structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the design of future echocardiography foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Most current approaches follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates its robustness in real-world settings.</p></details> |  | None |

However, progress in this area is currently hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to 57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient embodied HRI.</p></details> |  | None |

In contrast, real-world scenarios often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and textual contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench (VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic abilities in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises ten vision-grounded environments that cover cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive interactions. The performance of VLM agents is evaluated across three dimensions: perception measured by element recognition accuracy; strategic reasoning measured by next-action prediction accuracy; and decision-making measured by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments on fifteen leading VLMs show that, although current models exhibit strong perception abilities, there remains a significant gap to optimal performance in reasoning and decision-making, with the best-performing model attaining 46.6% prediction accuracy and 31.4% normalized return. We further analyze the key factors influencing performance, conduct human experiments, and examine failure modes to provide a deeper understanding of VLMs' strategic abilities. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on strategic multimodal agents.

However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 13 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review | None |

| **[Sparse Covariance Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01669v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix of input data to leverage correlation information as pairwise connections. They have achieved success in a multitude of applications such as neuroscience, financial forecasting, and sensor networks. However, the empirical covariance matrix on which VNNs operate typically contains spurious correlations, creating a mismatch with the actual covariance matrix that degrades VNNs' performance and computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we put forth Sparse coVariance Neural Networks (S-VNNs), a framework that applies sparsification techniques on the sample covariance matrix and incorporates the latter into the VNN architecture. We investigate the S-VNN when the underlying data covariance matrix is both sparse and dense. When the true covariance matrix is sparse, we propose hard and soft thresholding to improve the covariance estimation and reduce the computational cost. Instead, when the true covariance is dense, we propose a stochastic sparsification where data correlations are dropped in probability according to principled strategies. Besides performance and computation improvements, we show that S-VNNs are more stable to finite-sample covariance estimations than nominal VNNs and the analogous sparse principal component analysis. By analyzing the impact of sparsification on their behavior, we tie the S-VNN stability to the data distribution and sparsification approach. We support our theoretical findings with experimental results on a variety of application scenarios, ranging from brain data to human action recognition, and show an improved task performance, improved stability, and reduced computational time compared to alternatives.</p></details> |  | None |

The quality of videos is constantly increasing, with current standards reaching 8K resolution. However, optical flow methods are usually designed for low resolution and do not generalize to large inputs due to their rigid architectures. They adopt downscaling or input tiling to reduce the input size, causing a loss of details and global information. There is also a lack of optical flow benchmarks to judge the actual performance of existing methods on high-resolution samples. Previous works only conducted qualitative high-resolution evaluations on hand-picked samples. This paper fills this gap in optical flow estimation in two ways. We propose DPFlow, an adaptive optical flow architecture capable of generalizing up to 8K resolution inputs while trained with only low-resolution samples. We also introduce Kubric-NK, a new benchmark for evaluating optical flow methods with input resolutions ranging from 1K to 8K. Our high-resolution evaluation pushes the boundaries of existing methods and reveals new insights about their generalization capabilities. Extensive experimental results show that DPFlow achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2015, Spring, and other high-resolution benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025.

| **[AssemblyHands-X: Modeling 3D Hand-Body Coordination for Understanding Bimanual Human Activities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23888v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose) for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of bimanual activities.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR) technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals. Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary rehabilitation in future research.

In this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined with a scene prediction loss.

Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement. Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks), superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions. Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight. Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative research's humanistic commitments.

| **[Prompt-guided Representation Disentanglement for Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21783v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

We evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories. These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and reliability constraints.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce a frequency-domain physics prior that improves motion plausibility without modifying model architectures. Our method decomposes common rigid motions (translation, rotation, scaling) into lightweight spectral losses, requiring only 2.7% of frequency coefficients while preserving 97%+ of spectral energy. Applied to Open-Sora, MVDIT, and Hunyuan, our approach improves both motion accuracy and action recognition by ~11% on average on OpenVID-1M (relative), while maintaining visual quality. User studies show 74--83% preference for our physics-enhanced videos. It also reduces warping error by 22--37% (depending on the backbone) and improves temporal consistency scores. These results indicate that simple, global spectral cues are an effective drop-in regularizer for physically plausible motion in video diffusion.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Every Subtlety Counts: Fine-grained Person Independence Micro-Action Recognition via Distributionally Robust Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21261v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Biologically Plausible Learning via Bidirectional Spike-Based Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20284v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing biologically plausible learning algorithms that can achieve performance comparable to error backpropagation remains a longstanding challenge. Existing approaches often compromise biological plausibility by entirely avoiding the use of spikes for error propagation or relying on both positive and negative learning signals, while the question of how spikes can represent negative values remains unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce Bidirectional Spike-based Distillation (BSD), a novel learning algorithm that jointly trains a feedforward and a backward spiking network. We formulate learning as a transformation between two spiking representations (i.e., stimulus encoding and concept encoding) so that the feedforward network implements perception and decision-making by mapping stimuli to actions, while the backward network supports memory recall by reconstructing stimuli from concept representations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including image recognition, image generation, and sequential regression, show that BSD achieves performance comparable to networks trained with classical error backpropagation. These findings represent a significant step toward biologically grounded, spike-driven learning in neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M) module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally, SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model (LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door", "approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper", etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bpiyush.github.io/lift-website/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://bpiyush.github.io/lift-website) |
| **[Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10401v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this \emph{counterfactual inference gap}, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution.

We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines, including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.</p></details> |  | None |

Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness.

This study introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering, to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate, rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions, achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.</p></details> | 23 Pages, 9 Tables | None |

MoCrop uses motion vectors that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6 to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment in the compressed domain.

Each team - a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress. Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events, thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing FSAR approaches typically neglect the role of individual motion pattern in comparison, and under-explore the feature statistics for video dynamics. Thereby, they struggle to handle the challenging temporal misalignment in video dynamics, particularly by using 2D backbones. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes an adaptively aligned multi-scale second-order moment network, namely A$^2$M$^2$-Net, to describe the latent video dynamics with a collection of powerful representation candidates and adaptively align them in an instance-guided manner. To this end, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net involves two core components, namely, adaptive alignment (A$^2$ module) for matching, and multi-scale second-order moment (M$^2$ block) for strong representation. Specifically, M$^2$ block develops a collection of semantic second-order descriptors at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Furthermore, A$^2$ module aims to adaptively select informative candidate descriptors while considering the individual motion pattern. By such means, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net is able to handle the challenging temporal misalignment problem by establishing an adaptive alignment protocol for strong representation. Notably, our proposed method generalizes well to various few-shot settings and diverse metrics. The experiments are conducted on five widely used FSAR benchmarks, and the results show our A$^2$M$^2$-Net achieves very competitive performance compared to state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[PASS: Path-selective State Space Model for Event-based Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16953v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture intensity changes asynchronously with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution. Existing methods for event-based object/action recognition predominantly sample and convert event representation at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they are constrained to processing a limited number of event lengths and show poor frequency generalization, thus not fully leveraging the event's high temporal resolution. In this paper, we present our PASS framework, exhibiting superior capacity for spatiotemporal event modeling towards a larger number of event lengths and generalization across varying inference temporal frequencies. Our key insight is to learn adaptively encoded event features via the state space models (SSMs), whose linear complexity and generalization on input frequency make them ideal for processing high temporal resolution events. Specifically, we propose a Path-selective Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event presentations. On top of it, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features during the PEAS selection process. Our method outperforms prior methods on five public datasets and shows strong generalization across varying inference frequencies with less accuracy drop (ours -8.62% vs. -20.69% for the baseline). Overall, PASS exhibits strong long spatiotemporal modeling for a broader distribution of event length (1-10^9), precise temporal perception, and generalization for real-world</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

| **[KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04783v4)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD) |
| **[Benchmarking Offline Reinforcement Learning for Emotion-Adaptive Social Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16858v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of social robots to respond to human emotions is crucial for building trust and acceptance in human-robot collaborative environments. However, developing such capabilities through online reinforcement learning is sometimes impractical due to the prohibitive cost of data collection and the risk of generating unsafe behaviors. In this paper, we study the use of offline reinforcement learning as a practical and efficient alternative. This technique uses pre-collected data to enable emotion-adaptive social robots. We present a system architecture that integrates multimodal sensing and recognition, decision-making, and adaptive responses. Using a limited dataset from a human-robot game-playing scenario, we establish a benchmark for comparing offline reinforcement learning algorithms that do not require an online environment. Our results show that BCQ and CQL are more robust to data sparsity, achieving higher state-action values compared to NFQ, DQN, and DDQN. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking offline RL in emotion-adaptive robotics and informs future deployment in real-world HRI. Our findings provide empirical insight into the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms in data-constrained HRI. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking offline RL in emotion-adaptive robotics and informs its future deployment in real-world HRI, such as in conversational agents, educational partners, and personal assistants, require reliable emotional responsiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to conference</p></details> | None |
