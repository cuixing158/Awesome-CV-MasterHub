| **[Surg-3M: A Dataset and Foundation Model for Perception in Surgical Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19740v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in computer-assisted surgical procedures heavily rely on accurate visual data interpretation from camera systems used during surgeries. Traditional open-access datasets focusing on surgical procedures are often limited by their small size, typically consisting of fewer than 100 videos with less than 100K images. To address these constraints, a new dataset called Surg-3M has been compiled using a novel aggregation pipeline that collects high-resolution videos from online sources. Featuring an extensive collection of over 4K surgical videos and more than 3 million high-quality images from multiple procedure types, Surg-3M offers a comprehensive resource surpassing existing alternatives in size and scope, including two novel tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this dataset, we present SurgFM, a self-supervised foundation model pretrained on Surg-3M that achieves impressive results in downstream tasks such as surgical phase recognition, action recognition, and tool presence detection. Combining key components from ConvNeXt, DINO, and an innovative augmented distillation method, SurgFM exhibits exceptional performance compared to specialist architectures across various benchmarks. Our experimental results show that SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in multiple downstream tasks, including significant gains in surgical phase recognition (+8.9pp, +4.7pp, and +3.9pp of Jaccard in AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), action recognition (+3.1pp of mAP in CholecT50) and tool presence detection (+4.6pp of mAP in Cholec80). Moreover, even when using only half of the data, SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in AutoLaparo and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Cholec80. Both Surg-3M and SurgFM have significant potential to accelerate progress towards developing autonomous robotic surgery systems.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |
| **[fine-CLIP: Enhancing Zero-Shot Fine-Grained Surgical Action Recognition with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19670v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language models like CLIP have advanced zero-shot surgical phase recognition, they struggle with fine-grained surgical activities, especially action triplets. This limitation arises because current CLIP formulations rely on global image features, which overlook the fine-grained semantics and contextual details crucial for complex tasks like zero-shot triplet recognition. Furthermore, these models do not explore the hierarchical structure inherent in triplets, reducing their ability to generalize to novel triplets. To address these challenges, we propose fine-CLIP, which learns object-centric features and lever- ages the hierarchy in triplet formulation. Our approach integrates three components: hierarchical prompt modeling to capture shared semantics, LoRA-based vision backbone adaptation for enhanced feature extraction, and a graph-based condensation strategy that groups similar patch features into meaningful object clusters. Since triplet classification is a challenging task, we introduce an alternative yet meaningful base-to-novel generalization benchmark with two settings on the CholecT50 dataset: Unseen-Target, assessing adaptability to triplets with novel anatomical structures, and Unseen-Instrument-Verb, where models need to generalize to novel instrument-verb interactions. fine-CLIP shows significant improvements in F1 and mAP, enhancing zero-shot recognition of novel surgical triplets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 tables, 3 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[HD-EPIC: A Highly-Detailed Egocentric Video Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04144v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a validation dataset of newly-collected kitchen-based egocentric videos, manually annotated with highly detailed and interconnected ground-truth labels covering: recipe steps, fine-grained actions, ingredients with nutritional values, moving objects, and audio annotations. Importantly, all annotations are grounded in 3D through digital twinning of the scene, fixtures, object locations, and primed with gaze. Footage is collected from unscripted recordings in diverse home environments, making HDEPIC the first dataset collected in-the-wild but with detailed annotations matching those in controlled lab environments. We show the potential of our highly-detailed annotations through a challenging VQA benchmark of 26K questions assessing the capability to recognise recipes, ingredients, nutrition, fine-grained actions, 3D perception, object motion, and gaze direction. The powerful long-context Gemini Pro only achieves 38.5% on this benchmark, showcasing its difficulty and highlighting shortcomings in current VLMs. We additionally assess action recognition, sound recognition, and long-term video-object segmentation on HD-EPIC. HD-EPIC is 41 hours of video in 9 kitchens with digital twins of 413 kitchen fixtures, capturing 69 recipes, 59K fine-grained actions, 51K audio events, 20K object movements and 37K object masks lifted to 3D. On average, we have 263 annotations per minute of our unscripted videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025.

| **[LLaVAction: evaluating and training multi-modal large language models for action recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18712v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human behavior requires measuring behavioral actions. Due to its complexity, behavior is best mapped onto a rich, semantic structure such as language. The recent development of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) is a promising candidate for a wide range of action understanding tasks. In this work, we focus on evaluating and then improving MLLMs to perform action recognition. We reformulate EPIC-KITCHENS-100, one of the largest and most challenging egocentric action datasets, to the form of video multiple question answering (EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA). We show that when we sample difficult incorrect answers as distractors, leading MLLMs struggle to recognize the correct actions. We propose a series of methods that greatly improve the MLLMs' ability to perform action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art on both the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 validation set, as well as outperforming GPT-4o by 21 points in accuracy on EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA. Lastly, we show improvements on other action-related video benchmarks such as EgoSchema, PerceptionTest, LongVideoBench, VideoMME and MVBench, suggesting that MLLMs are a promising path forward for complex action tasks.

| **[Body-Hand Modality Expertized Networks with Cross-attention for Fine-grained Skeleton Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14960v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition (HAR) is a vital technology in robotics and human-robot interaction. However, most existing methods concentrate primarily on full-body movements and often overlook subtle hand motions that are critical for distinguishing fine-grained actions. Recent work leverages a unified graph representation that combines body, hand, and foot keypoints to capture detailed body dynamics. Yet, these models often blur fine hand details due to the disparity between body and hand action characteristics and the loss of subtle features during the spatial-pooling. In this paper, we propose BHaRNet (Body-Hand action Recognition Network), a novel framework that augments a typical body-expert model with a hand-expert model. Our model jointly trains both streams with an ensemble loss that fosters cooperative specialization, functioning in a manner reminiscent of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Moreover, cross-attention is employed via an expertized branch method and a pooling-attention module to enable feature-level interactions and selectively fuse complementary information. Inspired by MMNet, we also demonstrate the applicability of our approach to multi-modal tasks by leveraging RGB information, where body features guide RGB learning to capture richer contextual cues. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks (NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, and Northwestern-UCLA) demonstrate that BHaRNet achieves SOTA accuracies -- improving from 86.4\% to 93.0\% in hand-intensive actions -- while maintaining fewer GFLOPs and parameters than the relevant unified methods.</p></details> | 7 figures, 8 pages | None |
| **[Temporal-Guided Spiking Neural Networks for Event-Based Human Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17132v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Explaining Human Activity Recognition with SHAP: Validating Insights with Perturbation and Quantitative Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03714v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Human Activity Recognition (HAR), understanding the intricacy of body movements within high-risk applications is essential. This study uses SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to explain the decision-making process of Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) when classifying activities with skeleton data. We employ SHAP to explain two real-world datasets: one for cerebral palsy (CP) classification and the widely used NTU RGB+D 60 action recognition dataset. To test the explanation, we introduce a novel perturbation approach that modifies the model's edge importance matrix, allowing us to evaluate the impact of specific body key points on prediction outcomes. To assess the fidelity of our explanations, we employ informed perturbation, targeting body key points identified as important by SHAP and comparing them against random perturbation as a control condition. This perturbation enables a judgment on whether the body key points are truly influential or non-influential based on the SHAP values. Results on both datasets show that body key points identified as important through SHAP have the largest influence on the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity metrics. Our findings highlight that SHAP can provide granular insights into the input feature contribution to the prediction outcome of GCNs in HAR tasks. This demonstrates the potential for more interpretable and trustworthy models in high-stakes applications like healthcare or rehabilitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> | None |
| **[Revealing Key Details to See Differences: A Novel Prototypical Perspective for Skeleton-based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18941v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In skeleton-based action recognition, a key challenge is distinguishing between actions with similar trajectories of joints due to the lack of image-level details in skeletal representations. Recognizing that the differentiation of similar actions relies on subtle motion details in specific body parts, we direct our approach to focus on the fine-grained motion of local skeleton components. To this end, we introduce ProtoGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based model that breaks down the dynamics of entire skeleton sequences into a combination of learnable prototypes representing core motion patterns of action units. By contrasting the reconstruction of prototypes, ProtoGCN can effectively identify and enhance the discriminative representation of similar actions. Without bells and whistles, ProtoGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, and FineGYM, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/firework8/ProtoGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/firework8/ProtoGCN) |
| **[EPAM-Net: An Efficient Pose-driven Attention-guided Multimodal Network for Video Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05421v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multimodal-based human action recognition approaches are computationally intensive, limiting their deployment in real-time applications. In this work, we present a novel and efficient pose-driven attention-guided multimodal network (EPAM-Net) for action recognition in videos. Specifically, we propose eXpand temporal Shift (X-ShiftNet) convolutional architectures for RGB and pose streams to capture spatio-temporal features from RGB videos and their skeleton sequences. The X-ShiftNet tackles the high computational cost of the 3D CNNs by integrating the Temporal Shift Module (TSM) into an efficient 2D CNN, enabling efficient spatiotemporal learning. Then skeleton features are utilized to guide the visual network stream, focusing on keyframes and their salient spatial regions using the proposed spatial-temporal attention block. Finally, the predictions of the two streams are fused for final classification. The experimental results show that our method, with a significant reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), outperforms and competes with the state-of-the-art methods on NTU RGB-D 60, NTU RGB-D 120, PKU-MMD, and Toyota SmartHome datasets. The proposed EPAM-Net provides up to a 72.8x reduction in FLOPs and up to a 48.6x reduction in the number of network parameters.

| **[STEP: Simultaneous Tracking and Estimation of Pose for Animals and Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13344v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce STEP, a novel framework utilizing Transformer-based discriminative model prediction for simultaneous tracking and estimation of pose across diverse animal species and humans. We are inspired by the fact that the human brain exploits spatiotemporal continuity and performs concurrent localization and pose estimation despite the specialization of brain areas for form and motion processing. Traditional discriminative models typically require predefined target states for determining model weights, a challenge we address through Gaussian Map Soft Prediction (GMSP) and Offset Map Regression Adapter (OMRA) Modules. These modules remove the necessity of keypoint target states as input, streamlining the process. Our method starts with a known target state in the initial frame of a given video sequence. It then seamlessly tracks the target and estimates keypoints of anatomical importance as output for subsequent frames. Unlike prevalent top-down pose estimation methods, our approach doesn't rely on per-frame target detections due to its tracking capability. This facilitates a significant advancement in inference efficiency and potential applications. We train and validate our approach on datasets encompassing diverse species. Our experiments demonstrate superior results compared to existing methods, opening doors to various applications, including but not limited to action recognition and behavioral analysis.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[From Image to Video: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07001v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling, enabling unprecedented realism in image and video synthesis. This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  | None |

Architectural innovations including 1D, 2D, and 3D convolutional models, dilated and grouped convolutions, depthwise separable convolutions, and attention mechanisms address domain-specific challenges and enhance feature representation and computational efficiency. Structural refinements such as spatial-channel exploitation, multi-path design, and feature-map enhancement contribute to robust hierarchical feature extraction and improved generalization, particularly through transfer learning. Efficient preprocessing strategies, including Fourier transforms, structured transforms, low-precision computation, and weight compression, optimize inference speed and facilitate deployment in resource-constrained environments. This survey presents a unified taxonomy that classifies CNN architectures based on spatial exploitation, multi-path structures, depth, width, dimensionality expansion, channel boosting, and attention mechanisms. It systematically reviews CNN applications in face recognition, pose estimation, action recognition, text classification, statistical language modeling, disease diagnosis, radiological analysis, cryptocurrency sentiment prediction, 1D data processing, video analysis, and speech recognition. In addition to consolidating architectural advancements, the review highlights emerging learning paradigms such as few-shot, zero-shot, weakly supervised, federated learning frameworks and future research directions include hybrid CNN-transformer models, vision-language integration, generative learning, etc. This review provides a comprehensive perspective on CNN's evolution from 2015 to 2025, outlining key innovations, challenges, and opportunities.</p></details> | <details><summary>100 P...</summary><p>100 Pages, 44 Figures</p></details> | None |
| **[DPFlow: Adaptive Optical Flow Estimation with a Dual-Pyramid Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14880v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical flow estimation is essential for video processing tasks, such as restoration and action recognition. The quality of videos is constantly increasing, with current standards reaching 8K resolution. However, optical flow methods are usually designed for low resolution and do not generalize to large inputs due to their rigid architectures. They adopt downscaling or input tiling to reduce the input size, causing a loss of details and global information. There is also a lack of optical flow benchmarks to judge the actual performance of existing methods on high-resolution samples. Previous works only conducted qualitative high-resolution evaluations on hand-picked samples. This paper fills this gap in optical flow estimation in two ways. We propose DPFlow, an adaptive optical flow architecture capable of generalizing up to 8K resolution inputs while trained with only low-resolution samples. We also introduce Kubric-NK, a new benchmark for evaluating optical flow methods with input resolutions ranging from 1K to 8K. Our high-resolution evaluation pushes the boundaries of existing methods and reveals new insights about their generalization capabilities. Extensive experimental results show that DPFlow achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2015, Spring, and other high-resolution benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025.

| **[A Real-Time Human Action Recognition Model for Assisted Living](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18957v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety and well-being of elderly and vulnerable populations in assisted living environments is a critical concern. Computer vision presents an innovative and powerful approach to predicting health risks through video monitoring, employing human action recognition (HAR) technology. However, real-time prediction of human actions with high performance and efficiency is a challenge. This research proposes a real-time human action recognition model that combines a deep learning model and a live video prediction and alert system, in order to predict falls, staggering and chest pain for residents in assisted living. Six thousand RGB video samples from the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset were selected to create a dataset with four classes: Falling, Staggering, Chest Pain, and Normal, with the Normal class comprising 40 daily activities. Transfer learning technique was applied to train four state-of-the-art HAR models on a GPU server, namely, UniFormerV2, TimeSformer, I3D, and SlowFast. Results of the four models are presented in this paper based on class-wise and macro performance metrics, inference efficiency, model complexity and computational costs. TimeSformer is proposed for developing the real-time human action recognition model, leveraging its leading macro F1 score (95.33%), recall (95.49%), and precision (95.19%) along with significantly higher inference throughput compared to the others. This research provides insights to enhance safety and health of the elderly and people with chronic illnesses in assisted living environments, fostering sustainable care, smarter communities and industry innovation.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Action Recognition in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21113v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for surveillance in public spaces presents significant challenges due to the shortage of human resources. Current AI-based video surveillance systems heavily rely on core computer vision models that require extensive finetuning, which is particularly difficult in surveillance settings due to limited datasets and difficult setting (viewpoint, low quality, etc.). In this work, we propose leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), known for their strong zero and few-shot generalization, to tackle video understanding tasks in surveillance. Specifically, we explore VideoLLaMA2, a state-of-the-art LVLM, and an improved token-level sampling method, Self-Reflective Sampling (Self-ReS). Our experiments on the UCF-Crime dataset show that VideoLLaMA2 represents a significant leap in zero-shot performance, with 20% boost over the baseline. Self-ReS additionally increases zero-shot action recognition performance to 44.6%. These results highlight the potential of LVLMs, paired with improved sampling techniques, for advancing surveillance video analysis in diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional modules to capture temporal information. Although the additional modules increase the capacity of model, enabling it to better capture video-specific inductive biases, existing methods typically introduce a substantial number of new parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to enhance the alignment between textual and visual representations, achieving a balance between generalizable knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint.This constraint involves providing template inputs (e.g., "a video of \{\textbf{cls}\}") to the trainable language branch and LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions to the pre-trained language branch, enforcing output consistency between the branches. This approach reduces overfitting to downstream tasks and enhances the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Scalable Modeling of Compressed Videos for Efficient Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13724v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robust deep video representations has proven to be computationally challenging due to substantial decoding overheads, the enormous size of raw video streams, and their inherent high temporal redundancy. Different from existing schemes, operating exclusively in the compressed video domain and exploiting all freely available modalities, i.e., I-frames, and P-frames (motion vectors and residuals) offers a compute-efficient alternative. Existing methods approach this task as a naive multi-modality problem, ignoring the temporal correlation and implicit sparsity across P-frames for modeling stronger shared representations for videos of the same action, making training and generalization easier. By revisiting the high-level design of dominant video understanding backbones, we increase inference speed by a factor of $56$ while retaining similar performance. For this, we propose a hybrid end-to-end framework that factorizes learning across three key concepts to reduce inference cost by $330\times$ versus prior art: First, a specially designed dual-encoder scheme with efficient Spiking Temporal Modulators to minimize latency while retaining cross-domain feature aggregation. Second, a unified transformer model to capture inter-modal dependencies using global self-attention to enhance I-frame -- P-frame contextual interactions. Third, a Multi-Modal Mixer Block to model rich representations from the joint spatiotemporal token embeddings. Experiments show that our method results in a lightweight architecture achieving state-of-the-art video recognition performance on UCF-101, HMDB-51, K-400, K-600 and SS-v2 datasets with favorable costs ($0.73$J/V) and fast inference ($16$V/s). Our observations bring new insights into practical design choices for efficient next-generation spatiotemporal learners. Code is available.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their effectiveness in joint video and language understanding has not been extensively explored. In the paper, we introduce Valley, a multi-modal foundation model that is designed to enable enhanced video comprehension and instruction-following capabilities. To this end, we construct two datasets, namely Valley-702k and Valley-instruct-73k, to cover a diverse range of video-text alignment and video-based instruction tasks, such as multi-shot captions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal inference, etc. Then, we adopt ViT-L/14 as the vision encoder and explore three different temporal modeling modules to learn multifaceted features for enhanced video understanding. In addition, we implement a two-phase training approach for Valley: the first phase focuses solely on training the projection module to facilitate the LLM's capacity to understand visual input, and the second phase jointly trains the projection module and the LLM to improve their instruction following ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Valley has the potential to serve as an effective video assistant, simplifying complex video-understanding scenarios.

| **[A Generically Contrastive Spatiotemporal Representation Enhancement for 3D Skeleton Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15144v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition is a central task in computer vision and human-robot interaction. However, most previous methods suffer from overlooking the explicit exploitation of the latent data distributions (i.e., the intra-class variations and inter-class relations), thereby leading to confusion about ambiguous samples and sub-optimum solutions of the skeleton encoders. To mitigate this, we propose a Contrastive Spatiotemporal Representation Enhancement (CSRE) framework to obtain more discriminative representations from the sequences, which can be incorporated into various previous skeleton encoders and can be removed when testing. Specifically, we decompose the representation into spatial- and temporal-specific features to explore fine-grained motion patterns along the corresponding dimensions. Furthermore, to explicitly exploit the latent data distributions, we employ the attentive features to contrastive learning, which models the cross-sequence semantic relations by pulling together the features from the positive pairs and pushing away the negative pairs. Extensive experiments show that CSRE with five various skeleton encoders (HCN, 2S-AGCN, CTR-GCN, Hyperformer, and BlockGCN) achieves solid improvements on five benchmarks. The code will be released at https://github.com/zhshj0110/CSRE.</p></details> | Accepted by PR 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhshj0110/CSRE) |
| **[ProbDiffFlow: An Efficient Learning-Free Framework for Probabilistic Single-Image Optical Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12348v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies optical flow estimation, a critical task in motion analysis with applications in autonomous navigation, action recognition, and film production. Traditional optical flow methods require consecutive frames, which are often unavailable due to limitations in data acquisition or real-world scene disruptions. Thus, single-frame optical flow estimation is emerging in the literature. However, existing single-frame approaches suffer from two major limitations: (1) they rely on labeled training data, making them task-specific, and (2) they produce deterministic predictions, failing to capture motion uncertainty. To overcome these challenges, we propose ProbDiffFlow, a training-free framework that estimates optical flow distributions from a single image. Instead of directly predicting motion, ProbDiffFlow follows an estimation-by-synthesis paradigm: it first generates diverse plausible future frames using a diffusion-based model, then estimates motion from these synthesized samples using a pre-trained optical flow model, and finally aggregates the results into a probabilistic flow distribution. This design eliminates the need for task-specific training while capturing multiple plausible motions. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ProbDiffFlow achieves superior accuracy, diversity, and efficiency, outperforming existing single-image and two-frame baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Salient Temporal Encoding for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14524v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing a dynamic scene using a structured spatial-temporal scene graph is a novel and particularly challenging task. To tackle this task, it is crucial to learn the temporal interactions between objects in addition to their spatial relations. Due to the lack of explicitly annotated temporal relations in current benchmark datasets, most of the existing spatial-temporal scene graph generation methods build dense and abstract temporal connections among all objects across frames. However, not all temporal connections are encoding meaningful temporal dynamics. We propose a novel spatial-temporal scene graph generation method that selectively builds temporal connections only between temporal-relevant objects pairs and represents the temporal relations as explicit edges in the scene graph. The resulting sparse and explicit temporal representation allows us to improve upon strong scene graph generation baselines by up to $4.4\%$ in Scene Graph Detection. In addition, we show that our approach can be leveraged to improve downstream vision tasks. Particularly, applying our approach to action recognition, shows 0.6\% gain in mAP in comparison to the state-of-the-art</p></details> |  | None |

While some existing methods in the literature can run in real-time, they struggle with temporal scalability, i.e., they fail to adapt to long-duration manipulations effectively. To address this, leveraging the generalizable scene graph representations, we propose a new Factorized Graph Sequence Encoder network that not only runs in real-time but also scales effectively in the temporal dimension, thanks to its factorized encoder architecture. Additionally, we introduce Hand Pooling operation, a simple pooling operation for more focused extraction of the graph-level embeddings. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art real-time approach, achieving a 14.3\% and 5.6\% improvement in F1-macro score on the KIT Bimanual Action (Bimacs) Dataset and Collaborative Action (CoAx) Dataset, respectively. Moreover, we conduct an extensive ablation study to validate our network design choices. Finally, we compare our model with its architecturally similar RGB-based model on the Bimacs dataset and show the limitations of this model in contrast to ours on such an object-centric manipulation dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[VA-AR: Learning Velocity-Aware Action Representations with Mixture of Window Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11004v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a crucial task in artificial intelligence, with significant implications across various domains. We initially perform a comprehensive analysis of seven prominent action recognition methods across five widely-used datasets. This analysis reveals a critical, yet previously overlooked, observation: as the velocity of actions increases, the performance of these methods variably declines, undermining their robustness. This decline in performance poses significant challenges for their application in real-world scenarios. Building on these findings, we introduce the Velocity-Aware Action Recognition (VA-AR) framework to obtain robust action representations across different velocities. Our principal insight is that rapid actions (e.g., the giant circle backward in uneven bars or a smash in badminton) occur within short time intervals, necessitating smaller temporal attention windows to accurately capture intricate changes. Conversely, slower actions (e.g., drinking water or wiping face) require larger windows to effectively encompass the broader context. VA-AR employs a Mixture of Window Attention (MoWA) strategy, dynamically adjusting its attention window size based on the action's velocity. This adjustment enables VA-AR to obtain a velocity-aware representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of action recognition. Extensive experiments confirm that VA-AR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the same five datasets, demonstrating VA-AR's effectiveness across a broad spectrum of action recognition scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[SurgRAW: Multi-Agent Workflow with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Surgical Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10265v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in surgical intelligence is hindered by hallucinations, domain knowledge gaps, and limited understanding of task interdependencies within surgical scenes, undermining clinical reliability. While recent VLMs demonstrate strong general reasoning and thinking capabilities, they still lack the domain expertise and task-awareness required for precise surgical scene interpretation. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can structure reasoning more effectively, current approaches rely on self-generated CoT steps, which often exacerbate inherent domain gaps and hallucinations. To overcome this, we present SurgRAW, a CoT-driven multi-agent framework that delivers transparent, interpretable insights for most tasks in robotic-assisted surgery. By employing specialized CoT prompts across five tasks: instrument recognition, action recognition, action prediction, patient data extraction, and outcome assessment, SurgRAW mitigates hallucinations through structured, domain-aware reasoning. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is also integrated to external medical knowledge to bridge domain gaps and improve response reliability. Most importantly, a hierarchical agentic system ensures that CoT-embedded VLM agents collaborate effectively while understanding task interdependencies, with a panel discussion mechanism promotes logical consistency. To evaluate our method, we introduce SurgCoTBench, the first reasoning-based dataset with structured frame-level annotations. With comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed SurgRAW with 29.32% accuracy improvement over baseline VLMs on 12 robotic procedures, achieving the state-of-the-art performance and advancing explainable, trustworthy, and autonomous surgical assistance.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize object and action recognition, often neglecting the intricate nuances of human emotions, behaviors, and speech-visual alignment within video content. We present HumanVBench, an innovative benchmark meticulously crafted to bridge these gaps in the evaluation of video MLLMs. HumanVBench comprises 16 carefully designed tasks that explore two primary dimensions: inner emotion and outer manifestations, spanning static and dynamic, basic and complex, as well as single-modal and cross-modal aspects. With two advanced automated pipelines for video annotation and distractor-included QA generation, HumanVBench utilizes diverse state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques to streamline benchmark data synthesis and quality assessment, minimizing human annotation dependency tailored to human-centric multimodal attributes. A comprehensive evaluation across 22 SOTA video MLLMs reveals notable limitations in current performance, especially in cross-modal and emotion perception, underscoring the necessity for further refinement toward achieving more human-like understanding. HumanVBench is open-sourced to facilitate future advancements and real-world applications in video MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 23 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

Unlike images, videos possess an additional temporal dimension, which harbors considerable redundant information, making condensation even more crucial. However, video dataset condensation still remains an underexplored area. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a large-scale study with systematic design and fair comparison. Specifically, our work delves into three key aspects to provide valuable empirical insights: (1) temporal processing of video data, (2) the evaluation protocol for video dataset condensation, and (3) adaptation of condensation algorithms to the space-time domain. From this study, we derive several intriguing observations: (i) labeling methods greatly influence condensation performance, (ii) simple sliding-window sampling is effective for temporal processing, and (iii) dataset distillation methods perform better in challenging scenarios, while sample selection methods excel in easier ones. Furthermore, we propose a unified evaluation protocol for the fair comparison of different condensation algorithms and achieve state-of-the-art results on four widely-used action recognition datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, SSv2 and K400.

Recent approaches mainly focus on employing image-level features to construct temporal dependencies and generate prototypes for each action category. However, a considerable number of these methods utilize mainly image-level features that incorporate background noise and focus insufficiently on real foreground (action-related instances), thereby compromising the recognition capability, particularly in the few-shot scenario. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel joint Image-Instance level Spatial-temporal attention approach (I2ST) for Few-shot Action Recognition. The core concept of I2ST is to perceive the action-related instances and integrate them with image features via spatial-temporal attention. Specifically, I2ST consists of two key components: Action-related Instance Perception and Joint Image-Instance Spatial-temporal Attention. Given the basic representations from the feature extractor, the Action-related Instance Perception is introduced to perceive action-related instances under the guidance of a text-guided segmentation model. Subsequently, the Joint Image-Instance Spatial-temporal Attention is used to construct the feature dependency between instances and images...</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computer Vision and Image Understanding</p></details> | None |

In zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, aligning skeleton features with the text features of action labels is essential for accurately predicting unseen actions. Previous methods focus on direct alignment between skeleton and text latent spaces, but the modality gaps between these spaces hinder robust generalization learning. Motivated from the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models, we leverage their alignment capabilities between different modalities mostly by focusing on the training process during reverse diffusion rather than using their generative power. Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones. Our TDSM significantly outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with large margins of 2.36%-point to 13.05%-point, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability in zero-shot settings through effective skeleton-text matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kaist-viclab.github.io/TDSM_site) |
| **[Synchronized and Fine-Grained Head for Skeleton-Based Ambiguous Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14833v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition using GCNs has achieved remarkable performance, but recognizing ambiguous actions, such as "waving" and "saluting", remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on a serial combination of GCNs and TCNs, where spatial and temporal features are extracted independently, leading to an unbalanced spatial-temporal information, which hinders accurate action recognition. Moreover, existing methods for ambiguous actions often overemphasize local details, resulting in the loss of crucial global context, which further complicates the task of differentiating ambiguous actions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play module called SF-Head, inserted between GCN and TCN layers. SF-Head first conducts SSTE with a Feature Redundancy Loss (F-RL), ensuring a balanced interaction. It then performs AC-FA, with a Feature Consistency Loss (F-CL), which aligns the aggregated feature with their original spatial-temporal feature. Experimental results on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA and PKU-MMD I datasets demonstrate significant improvements in distinguishing ambiguous actions.</p></details> | 25pages | None |
| **[Adaptive Hyper-Graph Convolution Network for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition with Virtual Connections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14796v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shared topology of human skeletons motivated the recent investigation of graph convolutional network (GCN) solutions for action recognition. However, most of the existing GCNs rely on the binary connection of two neighboring vertices (joints) formed by an edge (bone), overlooking the potential of constructing multi-vertex convolution structures. Although some studies have attempted to utilize hyper-graphs to represent the topology, they rely on a fixed construction strategy, which limits their adaptivity in uncovering the intricate latent relationships within the action. In this paper, we address this oversight and explore the merits of an adaptive hyper-graph convolutional network (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information conveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively optimises the hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven multi-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we outperform the existing solutions on NTU-120, achieving 90.5\% and 91.7\% in terms of the top-1 recognition accuracy on X-Sub and X-Set.</p></details> |  | None |

Real-world time series datasets typically exhibit complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, RNN-based, CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid models have been proposed. Unfortunately, current deep learning-based methods often neglect the simultaneous construction of local features and global dependencies at different time scales, lacking sufficient feature extraction capabilities to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multiscale Periodic Time Series Network (MPTSNet), which integrates multiscale local patterns and global correlations to fully exploit the inherent information in time series. Recognizing the multi-periodicity and complex variable correlations in time series, we use the Fourier transform to extract primary periods, enabling us to decompose data into multiscale periodic segments. Leveraging the inherent strengths of CNN and attention mechanism, we introduce the PeriodicBlock, which adaptively captures local patterns and global dependencies while offering enhanced interpretability through attention integration across different periodic scales. The experiments on UEA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MPTSNet outperforms 21 existing advanced baselines in the MTSC tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 | None |

However, current Transformer-based methods for video pose estimation often face challenges in managing redundant temporal information and achieving fine-grained perception because they only focus on processing low-resolution features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale resolution framework that encodes spatio-temporal representations at varying granularities and executes fine-grained perception compensation. Furthermore, we employ a density peaks clustering method to dynamically identify and prioritize tokens that offer important semantic information. This strategy effectively prunes redundant feature tokens, especially those arising from multi-frame features, thereby optimizing computational efficiency without sacrificing semantic richness. Empirically, it sets new benchmarks for both performance and efficiency on three large-scale datasets. Our method achieves a 93.8% improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline, while also enhancing pose estimation accuracy, reaching 87.4 mAP on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

We evaluate two fusion strategies: early-fusion, which combines RGB frames with Gaussian heatmaps of pose keypoints at the input stage, and late-fusion, which employs a multi-stream architecture with attention mechanisms to combine RGB and pose features. Experiments on the FR-FS dataset demonstrate that Gate-Shift-Pose significantly outperforms the RGB-only baseline, improving accuracy by up to 40% with ResNet18 and 20% with ResNet50. Early-fusion achieves the highest accuracy (98.08%) with ResNet50, leveraging the model's capacity for effective multimodal integration, while late-fusion is better suited for lighter backbones like ResNet18. These results highlight the potential of multimodal architectures for sports action recognition and the critical role of skeleton pose information in capturing complex motion patterns.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the high computational complexity of mainstream Transformer-based methods limits their application. Recent Mamba demonstrates efficiency in modeling long sequences, but directly applying Mamba to FSAR overlooks the importance of local feature modeling and alignment. Moreover, long sub-sequences within the same class accumulate intra-class variance, which adversely impacts FSAR performance. To solve these challenges, we propose a Matryoshka MAmba and CoNtrasTive LeArning framework (Manta). Firstly, the Matryoshka Mamba introduces multiple Inner Modules to enhance local feature representation, rather than directly modeling global features. An Outer Module captures dependencies of timeline between these local features for implicit temporal alignment. Secondly, a hybrid contrastive learning paradigm, combining both supervised and unsupervised methods, is designed to mitigate the negative effects of intra-class variance accumulation. The Matryoshka Mamba and the hybrid contrastive learning paradigm operate in two parallel branches within Manta, enhancing Mamba for FSAR of long sub-sequence. Manta achieves new state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks, including SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical studies prove that Manta significantly improves FSAR of long sub-sequence from multiple perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

When data with a trigger is processed by a backdoor model, it can lead to mispredictions targeted by attackers, whereas normal data yields regular results. The scope of backdoor attacks is expanding beyond computer vision and encroaching into areas such as natural language processing and speech recognition. Nevertheless, existing backdoor defense methods are typically tailored to specific data modalities, restricting their application in multimodal contexts. While multimodal learning proves highly applicable in facial recognition, sentiment analysis, action recognition, visual question answering, the security of these models remains a crucial concern. Specifically, there are no existing backdoor benchmarks targeting multimodal applications or related tasks. In order to facilitate the research in multimodal backdoor, we introduce BackdoorMBTI, the first backdoor learning toolkit and benchmark designed for multimodal evaluation across three representative modalities from eleven commonly used datasets. BackdoorMBTI provides a systematic backdoor learning pipeline, encompassing data processing, data poisoning, backdoor training, and evaluation. The generated poison datasets and backdoor models enable detailed evaluation of backdoor defenses. Given the diversity of modalities, BackdoorMBTI facilitates systematic evaluation across different data types. Furthermore, BackdoorMBTI offers a standardized approach to handling practical factors in backdoor learning, such as issues related to data quality and erroneous labels. We anticipate that BackdoorMBTI will expedite future research in backdoor defense methods within a multimodal context.

However, the complexity of real-world backgrounds presents significant challenges for this task, and previous approaches have struggled with practical implementation due to their limited ability to observe subtle behavioral differences and effectively learn inter-frame features from video. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Perception (STP) architecture that emphasizes both temporal information and spatial relationships between key objects, incorporating a causal decoder to perform behavior recognition and temporal action localization. Without requiring multimodal input, STP directly extracts temporal and spatial distance features from RGB video clips. Subsequently, these dual features are jointly encoded by maximizing the expected likelihood across all possible permutations of the factorization order. By integrating temporal and spatial features at different scales, STP can perceive subtle behavioral changes in challenging scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a causal-aware module to explore relationships between video frame features, significantly enhancing detection efficiency and performance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using two publicly available driver distraction detection benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most FSAR methods focus on single-scale (e.g., frame-level, segment-level, etc) feature alignment, which ignores that human actions with the same semantic may appear at different velocities. To this end, we develop a novel Multi-Velocity Progressive-alignment (MVP-Shot) framework to progressively learn and align semantic-related action features at multi-velocity levels. Concretely, a Multi-Velocity Feature Alignment (MVFA) module is designed to measure the similarity between features from support and query videos with different velocity scales and then merge all similarity scores in a residual fashion. To avoid the multiple velocity features deviating from the underlying motion semantic, our proposed Progressive Semantic-Tailored Interaction (PSTI) module injects velocity-tailored text information into the video feature via feature interaction on channel and temporal domains at different velocities. The above two modules compensate for each other to make more accurate query sample predictions under the few-shot settings. Experimental results show our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on multiple standard few-shot benchmarks (i.e., HMDB51, UCF101, Kinetics, and SSv2-small).</p></details> | Accepted to TMM 2025 | None |

Specifically, we employ learnable prompts for the language model conditioned on the skeleton modality to optimize feature representation. Furthermore, we propose a fusion mechanism that combines dual-modality features using a salient fusion module, incorporating attention and transformer mechanisms to address the modalities' high dimensionality. This fusion process prioritizes informative video frames and body joints, enhancing the recognition accuracy of human actions. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset tailored for real-world robotic applications in construction sites, featuring visual, skeleton, and depth data modalities, named VolvoConstAct.

However, acquiring annotations for a video is costly, and semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been studied to improve performance even with a small number of labeled data in the task. Prior studies for semi-supervised video action recognition have mostly focused on using single modality - visuals - but the video is multi-modal, so utilizing both visuals and audio would be desirable and improve performance further, which has not been explored well. Therefore, we propose audio-visual SSL for video action recognition, which uses both visual and audio together, even with quite a few labeled data, which is challenging. In addition, to maximize the information of audio and video, we propose a novel audio source localization-guided mixup method that considers inter-modal relations between video and audio modalities.

Prior works on video alignment have focused on using global temporal ordering across sequence pairs, whereas our loss encourages identifying the best-scoring subsequence alignment. LAC uses the differentiable Smith-Waterman (SW) affine method, which features a flexible parameterization learned through the training phase, enabling the model to adjust the temporal gap penalty length dynamically.

Action recognition models often suffer from background bias (i.e., inferring actions based on background cues) and foreground bias (i.e., relying on subject appearance), which can be detrimental to real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles or assisted living monitoring. While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background bias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both foreground and background bias. We propose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that mitigates foreground and background biases without requiring specialized knowledge of the bias attributes. Our framework applies an adversarial cross-entropy loss to the sampled static clip (where all the frames are the same) and aims to make its class probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy maximization loss. Additionally, we introduce a gradient penalty loss for regularization against the debiasing process. We evaluate our method on established background and foreground bias protocols, setting a new state-of-the-art and strongly improving combined debiasing performance by over 12% absolute on HMDB51. Furthermore, we identify an issue of background leakage in the existing UCF101 protocol for bias evaluation which provides a shortcut to predict actions and does not provide an accurate measure of the debiasing capability of a model. We address this issue by proposing more fine-grained segmentation boundaries for the actor, where our method also outperforms existing approaches.

However, real-world applications often face challenges with incomplete modalities due to privacy concerns, efficiency needs, or hardware issues. Current methods, while effective, often necessitate retraining the model entirely to handle missing modalities, making them computationally intensive, particularly with large training datasets. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address this issue at test time without requiring retraining. We frame the problem as a test-time adaptation task, where the model adjusts to the available unlabeled data at test time. Our method, MiDl~(Mutual information with self-Distillation), encourages the model to be insensitive to the specific modality source present during testing by minimizing the mutual information between the prediction and the available modality. Additionally, we incorporate self-distillation to maintain the model's original performance when both modalities are available. MiDl represents the first self-supervised, online solution for handling missing modalities exclusively at test time. Through experiments with various pretrained models and datasets, MiDl demonstrates substantial performance improvement without the need for retraining.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce a novel video segmentation strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These segmented frames are then processed by two existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain player skeletal joints, and the other for shuttlecock trajectory detection to extract shuttlecock trajectories. Leveraging these joints, trajectories, and player positions as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset, ShuttleSet, which shows that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is likely to be a trend for racket sports action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (excluding references).

However, due to the static bias of CLIP, such video learners tend to overfit on shortcut static features, thereby compromising their generalizability, especially to novel out-of-context actions. To address this issue, we introduce Open-MeDe, a novel Meta-optimization framework with static Debiasing for Open-vocabulary action recognition. From a fresh perspective of generalization, Open-MeDe adopts a meta-learning approach to improve known-to-open generalizing and image-to-video debiasing in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, Open-MeDe introduces a cross-batch meta-optimization scheme that explicitly encourages video learners to quickly generalize to arbitrary subsequent data via virtual evaluation, steering a smoother optimization landscape. In effect, the free of CLIP regularization during optimization implicitly mitigates the inherent static bias of the video meta-learner. We further apply self-ensemble over the optimization trajectory to obtain generic optimal parameters that can achieve robust generalization to both in-context and out-of-context novel data. Extensive evaluations show that Open-MeDe not only surpasses state-of-the-art regularization methods tailored for in-context open-vocabulary action recognition but also substantially excels in out-of-context scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

The emergence of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies has heightened the demand for real-time performance in these applications. However, current state-of-the-art models often exhibit promising results at the expense of substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we present a query-optimized real-time Transformer (QORT-Former), the first Transformer-based real-time framework for 3D pose estimation of two hands and an object. We first limit the number of queries and decoders to meet the efficiency requirement. Given limited number of queries and decoders, we propose to optimize queries which are taken as input to the Transformer decoder, to secure better accuracy: (1) we propose to divide queries into three types (a left hand query, a right hand query and an object query) and enhance query features (2) by using the contact information between hands and an object and (3) by using three-step update of enhanced image and query features with respect to one another. With proposed methods, we achieved real-time pose estimation performance using just 108 queries and 1 decoder (53.5 FPS on an RTX 3090TI GPU). Surpassing state-of-the-art results on the H2O dataset by 17.6% (left hand), 22.8% (right hand), and 27.2% (object), as well as on the FPHA dataset by 5.3% (right hand) and 10.4% (object), our method excels in accuracy. Additionally, it sets the state-of-the-art in interaction recognition, maintaining real-time efficiency with an off-the-shelf action recognition module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up.

Analyzing it involves tasks such as classification, clustering, prototyping, and regression. Classification identifies normal vs. abnormal movements in skeleton-based motion sequences, clustering detects stock market behavior patterns, prototyping expands physical therapy datasets, and regression predicts patient recovery. Deep learning has recently gained traction in time series analysis due to its success in other domains. This thesis leverages deep learning to enhance classification with feature engineering, introduce foundation models, and develop a compact yet state-of-the-art architecture. We also address limited labeled data with self-supervised learning. Our contributions apply to real-world tasks, including human motion analysis for action recognition and rehabilitation. We introduce a generative model for human motion data, valuable for cinematic production and gaming. For prototyping, we propose a shape-based synthetic sample generation method to support regression models when data is scarce. Lastly, we critically evaluate discriminative and generative models, identifying limitations in current methodologies and advocating for a robust, standardized evaluation framework. Our experiments on public datasets provide novel insights and methodologies, advancing time series analysis with practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations. This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded. In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body. A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras. In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit. We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network. Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.

Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton sequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around human physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework. Alternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture higher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex joint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces motion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a fresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action recognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both traditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN and Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal graph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against motion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of Taylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion dynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This study underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to effectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference (WWW Companion 2025)</p></details> | None |

Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.

Traditional studies initially extracted refined features from each view, followed by implemented paired interaction and integration, but they potentially overlooked the critical local features in each view. When observing objects from multiple perspectives, individuals typically form a comprehensive impression and subsequently fill in specific details. Drawing inspiration from this cognitive process, we propose a novel trunk-branch contrastive network (TBCNet) for RGB-based multi-view action recognition. Distinctively, TBCNet first obtains fused features in the trunk block and then implicitly supplements vital details provided by the branch block via contrastive learning, generating a more informative and comprehensive action representation. Within this framework, we construct two core components: the multi-view deformable aggregation and the trunk-branch contrastive learning. MVDA employed in the trunk block effectively facilitates multi-view feature fusion and adaptive cross-view spatio-temporal correlation, where a global aggregation module is utilized to emphasize significant spatial information and a composite relative position bias is designed to capture the intra- and cross-view relative positions. Moreover, a trunk-branch contrastive loss is constructed between aggregated features and refined details from each view. By incorporating two distinct weights for positive and negative samples, a weighted trunk-branch contrastive loss is proposed to extract valuable information and emphasize subtle inter-class differences. The effectiveness of TBCNet is verified by extensive experiments on four datasets including NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, PKU-MMD, and N-UCLA dataset. Compared to other RGB-based methods, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-subject and cross-setting protocols.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Balanced Representation Learning for Long-tailed Skeleton-based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14024v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition has recently made significant progress. However, data imbalance is still a great challenge in real-world scenarios. The performance of current action recognition algorithms declines sharply when training data suffers from heavy class imbalance. The imbalanced data actually degrades the representations learned by these methods and becomes the bottleneck for action recognition. How to learn unbiased representations from imbalanced action data is the key to long-tailed action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel balanced representation learning method to address the long-tailed problem in action recognition. Firstly, a spatial-temporal action exploration strategy is presented to expand the sample space effectively, generating more valuable samples in a rebalanced manner. Secondly, we design a detached action-aware learning schedule to further mitigate the bias in the representation space. The schedule detaches the representation learning of tail classes from training and proposes an action-aware loss to impose more effective constraints. Additionally, a skip-modal representation is proposed to provide complementary structural information. The proposed method is validated on four skeleton datasets, NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA, and Kinetics. It not only achieves consistently large improvement compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also demonstrates a superior generalization capacity through extensive experiments.

Among various modalities, skeleton-based approaches have gained significant popularity, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing 3D temporal data while ensuring robustness to environmental variations. However, most existing works focus on segment-based recognition, making them unsuitable for real-time, continuous recognition scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel online recognition system designed for real-time skeleton sequence streaming. Our approach leverages a hybrid architecture combining Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (S-GCN) for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer-based Graph Encoder (TGE) for capturing temporal dependencies across frames. Additionally, we introduce a continual learning mechanism to enhance model adaptability to evolving data distributions, ensuring robust recognition in dynamic environments. We evaluate our method on the SHREC'21 benchmark dataset, demonstrating its superior performance in online hand gesture recognition. Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly reduces false positive rates, making it a compelling solution for real-time applications. The proposed system can be seamlessly integrated into various domains, including human-robot collaboration and assistive technologies, where natural and intuitive interaction is crucial.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite successes on existing testbeds, we find that current EgoVLMs can be easily misled by simple modifications, such as changing the verbs or nouns in interaction descriptions, with models struggling to distinguish between these changes. This raises the question: Do EgoVLMs truly understand hand-object interactions? To address this question, we introduce a benchmark called EgoHOIBench, revealing the performance limitation of current egocentric models when confronted with such challenges. We attribute this performance gap to insufficient fine-grained supervision and the greater difficulty EgoVLMs experience in recognizing verbs compared to nouns. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel asymmetric contrastive objective named EgoNCE++. For the video-to-text objective, we enhance text supervision by generating negative captions using large language models or leveraging pretrained vocabulary for HOI-related word substitutions. For the text-to-video objective, we focus on preserving an object-centric feature space that clusters video representations based on shared nouns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoNCE++ significantly enhances EgoHOI understanding, leading to improved performance across various EgoVLMs in tasks such as multi-instance retrieval, action recognition, and temporal understanding.

These limitations restrict its applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-driven framework for multimodal human action recognition, utilizing event camera and skeleton data. Our framework is centered on two key innovations: (1) a novel multimodal SNN architecture that employs distinct backbone networks for each modality-an SNN-based Mamba for event camera data and a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (SGN) for skeleton data-combined with a spiking semantic extraction module to capture deep semantic representations; and (2) a pioneering SNN-based discretized information bottleneck mechanism for modality fusion, which effectively balances the preservation of modality-specific semantics with efficient information compression. To validate our approach, we propose a novel method for constructing a multimodal dataset that integrates event camera and skeleton data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both recognition accuracy and energy efficiency, offering a promising solution for practical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Additionally, some works approach point clouds from the perspective of event vision, employing Spiking Neural Network (SNN) due to their asynchronous nature. However, these contributions are often domain-specific, making it difficult to extend their applicability to other intersecting fields. Moreover, while SNN-based visual tasks have seen significant growth, the conventional timestep-wise iterative activation strategy largely limits their real-world applications by large timesteps, resulting in significant delays and increased computational costs. Although some innovative methods achieve good performance with short timesteps (<10), few have fundamentally restructured the update strategy of spiking neurons to completely overcome the limitations of timesteps. In response to these concerns, we propose a novel and general activation strategy for spiking neurons called Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2). This approach extends the concept of timesteps from a manually crafted parameter within the activation function to any existing network structure. In experiments on common point cloud tasks (classification, object, and scene segmentation) and event cloud tasks (action recognition), we found that AMP2 stabilizes SNN training, maintains competitive performance, and reduces latency compared to the traditional timestep-wise activation paradigm.</p></details> |  | None |

However, using a single model to simultaneously recognize multiple attributes can lead to a decrease in accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel method i.e. Adaptive Attribute Prototype Model (AAPM) for human action recognition, which captures rich action-relevant attribute information and strikes a balance between accuracy and robustness. Firstly, we introduce the Text-Constrain Module (TCM) to incorporate textual information from potential labels, and constrain the construction of different attributes prototype representations.

Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities.

Recently, adversarial attacks have been proposed in this area, which exposes potential security concerns, and more importantly provides a good tool for model robustness test. Within this research, transfer-based attack is an important tool as it mimics the real-world scenario where an attacker has no knowledge of the target model, but is under-explored in Skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR). Consequently, existing S-HAR attacks exhibit weak adversarial transferability and the reason remains largely unknown. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon via the characterization of the loss function. We find that one prominent indicator of poor transferability is the low smoothness of the loss function. Led by this observation, we improve the transferability by properly smoothening the loss when computing the adversarial examples. This leads to the first Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothened model posterior of pre-trained surrogates, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike existing transfer-based methods which overlook the temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. For exhaustive evaluation, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense models. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR.

Conformal Predictions (CP), which provide label sets with rigorous guarantees on ground truth inclusion probabilities, have recently gained traction as a valuable tool in HITL settings. One key application area is video surveillance, closely associated with Human Action Recognition (HAR). This study explores the application of CP on top of state-of-the-art HAR methods that utilize extensively pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our findings reveal that CP can significantly reduce the average number of candidate classes without modifying the underlying VLM. However, these reductions often result in distributions with long tails. To address this, we introduce a method based on tuning the temperature parameter of the VLMs to minimize these tails without requiring additional calibration data.

A pressing topic subsequently arises: how can we effectively adapt CLIP to the video domain? Recent studies have focused on adjusting either the textual or visual branch of CLIP for action recognition. However, we argue that adaptations of both branches are crucial. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CLAVER}: a \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{A}ction \textbf{V}ideo Learn\textbf{er}, designed to shift CLIP's focus from the alignment of static visual objects and concrete nouns to the alignment of dynamic action behaviors and abstract verbs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Kronecker mask attention for temporal modeling. Our tailored Kronecker mask offers three benefits 1) it expands the temporal receptive field for each token, 2) it serves as an effective spatiotemporal heterogeneity inductive bias, mitigating the issue of spatiotemporal homogenization, and 3) it can be seamlessly plugged into transformer-based models. Regarding the textual branch, we leverage large language models to generate diverse, sentence-level and semantically rich interpretive prompts of actions, which shift the model's focus towards the verb comprehension. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and learning scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generality of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

However, finetuning CLIP directly for ZSAR yields suboptimal performance, given its inherent constraints in capturing essential temporal dynamics from both vision and text perspectives, especially when encountering novel actions with fine-grained spatiotemporal discrepancies. In this work, we propose Spatiotemporal Dynamic Duo (STDD), a novel CLIP-based framework to comprehend multi-modal spatiotemporal dynamics synergistically. For the vision side, we propose an efficient Space-time Cross Attention, which captures spatiotemporal dynamics flexibly with simple yet effective operations applied before and after spatial attention, without adding additional parameters or increasing computational complexity. For the semantic side, we conduct spatiotemporal text augmentation by comprehensively constructing an Action Semantic Knowledge Graph (ASKG) to derive nuanced text prompts. The ASKG elaborates on static and dynamic concepts and their interrelations, based on the idea of decomposing actions into spatial appearances and temporal motions. During the training phase, the frame-level video representations are meticulously aligned with prompt-level nuanced text representations, which are concurrently regulated by the video representations from the frozen CLIP to enhance generalizability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on popular video benchmarks (i.e., Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51) under challenging ZSAR settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

To mitigate this, linear attention mechanisms have been explored but struggle to capture the hierarchical structure of skeleton data. Meanwhile, the Poincar\'e model, as a typical hyperbolic geometry, offers a powerful framework for modeling hierarchical structures but lacks well-defined operations for existing mainstream linear attention. In this paper, we propose HyLiFormer, a novel hyperbolic linear attention Transformer tailored for skeleton-based action recognition. Our approach incorporates a Hyperbolic Transformation with Curvatures (HTC) module to map skeleton data into hyperbolic space and a Hyperbolic Linear Attention (HLA) module for efficient long-range dependency modeling. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that HyLiFormer significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving model accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficiency-critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes MD-BERT, a novel multi-stream approach that integrates complementary pre-processing techniques such as gamma correction and histogram equalization alongside raw dark frames to address these challenges. We introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, extending existing attentional fusion methods to a three-stream setting, thereby capturing fine-grained and global contextual information across different brightness and contrast enhancements. The fused spatiotemporal features are then processed by a BERT-based temporal model, which leverages its bidirectional self-attention to effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships across frames. Extensive experiments on the ARID V1.0 and ARID V1.5 dark video datasets show that MD-BERT outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each input stream and the effectiveness of the proposed DFF and BERT modules.

This characteristic introduces two novel challenges regarding micro-gestures that are worth rethinking. The first is whether strategies designed for other action recognition are entirely applicable to micro-gestures. The second is whether micro-gestures, as supplementary data, can provide additional insights for emotional understanding. In recognizing micro-gestures, we explored various augmentation strategies that take into account the subtle spatial and brief temporal characteristics of micro-gestures, often accompanied by repetitiveness, to determine more suitable augmentation methods. Considering the significance of temporal domain information for micro-gestures, we introduce a simple and efficient plug-and-play spatiotemporal balancing fusion method. We not only studied our method on the considered micro-gesture dataset but also conducted experiments on mainstream action datasets. The results show that our approach performs well in micro-gesture recognition and on other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous micro-gesture recognition methods. For emotional understanding based on micro-gestures, we construct complex emotional reasoning scenarios. Our evaluation, conducted with large language models, shows that micro-gestures play a significant and positive role in enhancing comprehensive emotional understanding. The scenarios we developed can be extended to other micro-gesture-based tasks such as deception detection and interviews. We confirm that our new insights contribute to advancing research in micro-gesture and emotional artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pr...</summary><p>We provide a link to the public release of the code and data in this new version</p></details> | None |

However, these models are typically trained on web videos, which often fail to capture the challenges present in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) videos. Existing works address ADL-specific challenges, such as similar appearances, subtle motion patterns, and multiple viewpoints, by combining 3D skeletons and RGB videos. However, these approaches are not integrated with language, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen action classes. In this paper, we introduce SKI models, which integrate 3D skeletons into the vision-language embedding space. SKI models leverage a skeleton-language model, SkeletonCLIP, to infuse skeleton information into Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) through collaborative training. Notably, SKI models do not require skeleton data during inference, enhancing their robustness for real-world applications. The effectiveness of SKI models is validated on three popular ADL datasets for zero-shot action recognition and video caption generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HFGCN:Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11007v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, action recognition has received much attention and wide application due to its important role in video understanding. Most of the researches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance via various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton points. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was seldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to classify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point in terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological relations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation classification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To synthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a novel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the proposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different body parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the recognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the categorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the hypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order relationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation of the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and hypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and channel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, our CSVR consists of three branches: a generative pose prediction branch, a discriminative context matching branch, and a video generating branch. Among them, the first one encodes dynamic motion feature by utilizing Conditional-GAN to predict the human poses of future frames, and the second branch extracts static context features by contrasting positive and negative video feature and I-frame feature pairs. The third branch is designed to generate both current and future video frames, for the purpose of collaboratively improving dynamic motion features and static context features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple popular video datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

While HAR has been extensively studied, action summarization, which involves identifying and summarizing continuous actions, remains an emerging task. This paper introduces the novel XRF V2 dataset, designed for indoor daily activity Temporal Action Localization (TAL) and action summarization. XRF V2 integrates multimodal data from Wi-Fi signals, IMU sensors (smartphones, smartwatches, headphones, and smart glasses), and synchronized video recordings, offering a diverse collection of indoor activities from 16 volunteers across three distinct environments. To tackle TAL and action summarization, we propose the XRFMamba neural network, which excels at capturing long-term dependencies in untrimmed sensory sequences and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, such as ActionFormer and WiFiTAD.

While transformer-based architectures have been the de facto in vision-language training, they face challenges like quadratic computational complexity, high GPU memory usage, and difficulty with long-term dependencies. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaVL, a novel model that leverages recent advancements in selective state space modality fusion to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and learn joint representations for vision and language data. MambaVL utilizes a shared state transition matrix across both modalities, allowing the model to capture information about actions from multiple perspectives within the scene. Furthermore, we propose a question-answering task that helps guide the model toward relevant cues. These questions provide critical information about actions, objects, and environmental context, leading to enhanced performance. As a result, MambaVL achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition on the Epic-Kitchens-100 dataset and outperforms baseline methods in action anticipation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bones of Contention: Exploring Query-Efficient Attacks Against Skeleton Recognition Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16843v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton action recognition models have secured more attention than video-based ones in various applications due to privacy preservation and lower storage requirements. Skeleton data are typically transmitted to cloud servers for action recognition, with results returned to clients via Apps/APIs. However, the vulnerability of skeletal models against adversarial perturbations gradually reveals the unreliability of these systems. Existing black-box attacks all operate in a decision-based manner, resulting in numerous queries that hinder efficiency and feasibility in real-world applications. Moreover, all attacks off the shelf focus on only restricted perturbations, while ignoring model weaknesses when encountered with non-semantic perturbations. In this paper, we propose two query-effIcient Skeletal Adversarial AttaCks, ISAAC-K and ISAAC-N. As a black-box attack, ISAAC-K utilizes Grad-CAM in a surrogate model to extract key joints where minor sparse perturbations are then added to fool the classifier. To guarantee natural adversarial motions, we introduce constraints of both bone length and temporal consistency. ISAAC-K finds stronger adversarial examples on $\ell_\infty$ norm, which can encompass those on other norms. Exhaustive experiments substantiate that ISAAC-K can uplift the attack efficiency of the perturbations under 10 skeletal models. Additionally, as a byproduct, ISAAC-N fools the classifier by replacing skeletons unrelated to the action. We surprisingly find that skeletal models are vulnerable to large perturbations where the part-wise non-semantic joints are just replaced, leading to a query-free no-box attack without any prior knowledge. Based on that, four adaptive defenses are eventually proposed to improve the robustness of skeleton recognition models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures | None |

| **[Optimizing Human Pose Estimation Through Focused Human and Joint Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14439v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose estimation has given rise to a broad spectrum of novel and compelling applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, as well as surveillance. However, accurate video pose estimation remains an open challenge. One aspect that has been overlooked so far is that existing methods learn motion clues from all pixels rather than focusing on the target human body, making them easily misled and disrupted by unimportant information such as background changes or movements of other people. Additionally, while the current Transformer-based pose estimation methods has demonstrated impressive performance with global modeling, they struggle with local context perception and precise positional identification. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose a bilayer Human-Keypoint Mask module that performs coarse-to-fine visual token refinement, which gradually zooms in on the target human body and keypoints while masking out unimportant figure regions. (2) We further introduce a novel deformable cross attention mechanism and a bidirectional separation strategy to adaptively aggregate spatial and temporal motion clues from constrained surrounding contexts. (3) We mathematically formulate the deformable cross attention, constraining that the model focuses solely on the regions centered at the target person body. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale benchmark datasets. A remarkable highlight is that our method achieves an 84.8 mean Average Precision (mAP) on the challenging wrist joint, which significantly outperforms the 81.5 mAP achieved by the current state-of-the-art method on the PoseTrack2017 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

While effective and adaptable, these models often require substantial computational resources, especially in scenarios with multiple views and multiple temporal sequences. Addressing this limitation, this paper introduces the MV-GMN model, a state-space model specifically designed to efficiently aggregate multi-modal data (RGB and skeleton), multi-view perspectives, and multi-temporal information for action recognition with reduced computational complexity. The MV-GMN model employs an innovative Multi-View Graph Mamba network comprising a series of MV-GMN blocks. Each block includes a proposed Bidirectional State Space Block and a GCN module. The Bidirectional State Space Block introduces four scanning strategies, including view-prioritized and time-prioritized approaches. The GCN module leverages rule-based and KNN-based methods to construct the graph network, effectively integrating features from different viewpoints and temporal instances. Demonstrating its efficacy, MV-GMN outperforms the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, achieving notable accuracies of 97.3\% and 96.7\% on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset in cross-subject and cross-view scenarios, respectively. MV-GMN also surpasses Transformer-based baselines while requiring only linear inference complexity, underscoring the model's ability to reduce computational load and enhance the scalability and applicability of multi-view action recognition technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

These patterns arise in sequential data, such as video frames, which are often essential to accurately distinguish actions that would be ambiguous in a single image. HAR has garnered considerable interest due to its broad applicability, ranging from robotics and surveillance systems to sports motion analysis, healthcare, and the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles. While several taxonomies have been proposed to categorize HAR approaches in surveys, they often overlook hybrid methodologies and fail to demonstrate how different models incorporate various architectures and modalities. In this comprehensive survey, we present the novel SMART-Vision taxonomy, which illustrates how innovations in deep learning for HAR complement one another, leading to hybrid approaches beyond traditional categories. Our survey provides a clear roadmap from foundational HAR works to current state-of-the-art systems, highlighting emerging research directions and addressing unresolved challenges in discussion sections for architectures within the HAR domain. We provide details of the research datasets that various approaches used to measure and compare goodness HAR approaches. We also explore the rapidly emerging field of Open-HAR systems, which challenges HAR systems by presenting samples from unknown, novel classes during test time.</p></details> |  | None |

Action recognition models need to represent the action itself, not the appearance. However, some fully-supervised works show that models often rely on static appearances, such as the background and objects, rather than human actions. This issue, known as static bias, has not been investigated for zero-shot. Although CLIP-based zero-shot models are now common, it remains unclear if they sufficiently focus on human actions, as CLIP primarily captures appearance features related to languages. In this paper, we investigate the influence of static bias in zero-shot action recognition with CLIP-based models. Our approach involves masking backgrounds, objects, and people differently during training and validation. Experiments with masking background show that models depend on background bias as their performance decreases for Kinetics400. However, for Mimetics, which has a weak background bias, masking the background leads to improved performance even if the background is masked during validation. Furthermore, masking both the background and objects in different colors improves performance for SSv2, which has a strong object bias. These results suggest that masking the background or objects during training prevents models from overly depending on static bias and makes them focus more on human action.</p></details> | In proc. of MMM2025 | None |

To address this we introduce BlanketGen2-Fit3D (BG2-Fit3D), an augmentation of Fit3D dataset that contains 1,217,312 frames with synthetic photo-realistic blankets. To generate it we used BlanketGen2, our new and improved version of our BlanketGen pipeline that simulates synthetic blankets using ground-truth Skinned Multi-Person Linear model (SMPL) meshes and then renders them as transparent images that can be layered on top of the original frames. This dataset was used in combination with the original Fit3D to finetune the ViTPose-B HPE model, to evaluate synthetic blanket augmentation effectiveness. The trained models were further evaluated on a real-world blanket occluded in-bed HPE dataset (SLP dataset). Comparing architectures trained on only Fit3D with the ones trained with our synthetic blanket augmentation the later improved pose estimation performance on BG2-Fit3D, the synthetic blanket occluded dataset significantly to (0.977 Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK), 0.149 Normalized Mean Error (NME)) with an absolute 4.4% PCK increase. Furthermore, the test results on SLP demonstrated the utility of synthetic data augmentation by improving performance by an absolute 2.3% PCK, on real-world images with the poses occluded by real blankets. These results show synthetic blanket augmentation has the potential to improve in-bed blanket occluded HPE from RGB images. The dataset as well as the code will be made available to the public.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> | None |

In light of this, data collected through monitoring can provide essential insights, and information for decision-making aimed at preserving global biodiversity. Despite the importance of such data, there is a notable scarcity of datasets featuring videos of birds, and none of the existing datasets offer detailed annotations of bird behaviors in video format. In response to this gap, our study introduces the first fine-grained video dataset specifically designed for bird behavior detection and species classification. This dataset addresses the need for comprehensive bird video datasets and provides detailed data on bird actions, facilitating the development of deep learning models to recognize these, similar to the advancements made in human action recognition.

However, existing methods still struggle to recognise seen actions on unseen objects due to the limitations in representing object shape and movement using 3D bounding boxes. Additionally, the reliance on object templates at test time limits their generalisability to unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage superquadrics as an alternative 3D object representation to bounding boxes and demonstrate their effectiveness on both template-free object reconstruction and action recognition tasks. Moreover, as we find that pure appearance-based methods can outperform the unified methods, the potential benefits from 3D geometric information remain unclear. Therefore, we study the compositionality of actions by considering a more challenging task where the training combinations of verbs and nouns do not overlap with the testing split. We extend H2O and FPHA datasets with compositional splits and design a novel collaborative learning framework that can explicitly reason about the geometric relations between hands and the manipulated object. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-arts in (compositional) action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

We also propose Spatial Temporal Variable Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-VGCN) to effectively model the Variable Graph (VG) containing object nodes. Specifically, in order to validate the role of interactive object information, by leveraging a simple self-training approach, we establish a new dataset, JXGC 24, and an extended dataset, NTU RGB+D+Object 60, including more than 2 million additional object nodes. At the same time, we designe the Variable Graph construction method to accommodate a variable number of nodes for graph structure. Additionally, we are the first to explore the overfitting issue introduced by incorporating additional object information, and we propose a VG-based data augmentation method to address this issue, called Random Node Attack. Finally, regarding the network structure, we introduce two fusion modules, CAF and WNPool, along with a novel Node Balance Loss, to enhance the comprehensive performance by effectively fusing and balancing skeleton and object node information. Our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on multiple skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. The accuracy of our method on NTU RGB+D 60 cross-subject split is 96.7\%, and on cross-view split, it is 99.2\%.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[High-Performance Inference Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18710v3)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the significant achievements have been made in skeleton-based human action recognition with the emergence of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models used for this task focus on constructing more complex higher-order connections between joint nodes to describe skeleton information, which leads to complex inference processes and high computational costs. To address the slow inference speed caused by overly complex model structures, we introduce re-parameterization and over-parameterization techniques to GCNs and propose two novel high-performance inference GCNs, namely HPI-GCN-RP and HPI-GCN-OP. After the completion of model training, model parameters are fixed. HPI-GCN-RP adopts re-parameterization technique to transform high-performance training model into fast inference model through linear transformations, which achieves a higher inference speed with competitive model performance. HPI-GCN-OP further utilizes over-parameterization technique to achieve higher performance improvement by introducing additional inference parameters, albeit with slightly decreased inference speed. The experimental results on the two skeleton-based action recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our HPI-GCN-OP achieves performance comparable to the current SOTA models, with inference speeds five times faster. Specifically, our HPI-GCN-OP achieves an accuracy of 93\% on the cross-subject split of the NTU-RGB+D 60 dataset, and 90.1\% on the cross-subject benchmark of the NTU-RGB+D 120 dataset.

While recent developments, driven by powerful large language models (LLMs), aim to be general enough to cover a wide range of categories, they often overlook the need for more specific capabilities. In this work, we address the more challenging task of Fine-grained Action Recognition (FAR), which focuses on detailed semantic labels within shorter temporal duration (e.g., "salto backward tucked with 1 turn"). Given the high costs of annotating fine-grained labels and the substantial data needed for fine-tuning LLMs, we propose to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our framework, SeFAR, incorporates several innovative designs to tackle these challenges. Specifically, to capture sufficient visual details, we construct Dual-level temporal elements as more effective representations, based on which we design a new strong augmentation strategy for the Teacher-Student learning paradigm through involving moderate temporal perturbation. Furthermore, to handle the high uncertainty within the teacher model's predictions for FAR, we propose the Adaptive Regulation to stabilize the learning process. Experiments show that SeFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FAR datasets, FineGym and FineDiving, across various data scopes. It also outperforms other semi-supervised methods on two classical coarse-grained datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51. Further analysis and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our designs. Additionally, we show that the features extracted by our SeFAR could largely promote the ability of multimodal foundation models to understand fine-grained and domain-specific semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025; Code: https://github.com/KyleHuang9/SeFAR</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/KyleHuang9/SeFAR) |

These events provide rich motion cues that can be exploited for various computer vision tasks, such as action recognition. However, most existing DVS-based action recognition methods lose temporal information during data transformation or suffer from noise and outliers caused by sensor imperfections or environmental factors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that preserves and exploits the spatiotemporal structure of event data for action recognition. Our framework consists of two main components: 1) a point-wise event masked autoencoder (MAE) that learns a compact and discriminative representation of event patches by reconstructing them from masked raw event camera points data; 2) an improved event points patch generation algorithm that leverages an event data inlier model and point-wise data augmentation techniques to enhance the quality and diversity of event points patches. To the best of our knowledge, our approach introduces the pre-train method into event camera raw points data for the first time, and we propose a novel event points patch embedding to utilize transformer-based models on event cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> | None |
| **[Frequency-aware Event Cloud Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20803v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are biologically inspired sensors that emit events asynchronously with remarkable temporal resolution, garnering significant attention from both industry and academia. Mainstream methods favor frame and voxel representations, which reach a satisfactory performance while introducing time-consuming transformation, bulky models, and sacrificing fine-grained temporal information. Alternatively, Point Cloud representation demonstrates promise in addressing the mentioned weaknesses, but it ignores the polarity information, and its models have limited proficiency in abstracting long-term events' features. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware network named FECNet that leverages Event Cloud representations. FECNet fully utilizes 2S-1T-1P Event Cloud by innovating the event-based Group and Sampling module. To accommodate the long sequence events from Event Cloud, FECNet embraces feature extraction in the frequency domain via the Fourier transform. This approach substantially extinguishes the explosion of Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) while effectively abstracting spatial-temporal features. We conducted extensive experiments on event-based object classification, action recognition, and human pose estimation tasks, and the results substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of FECNet.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

However, the complexity and high parameter count demands of these models hinder their practical applications, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose FreqMixForemrV2, which was built upon the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer) for identifying subtle and discriminative actions with pioneered frequency-domain analysis. We design a lightweight architecture that maintains robust performance while significantly reducing the model complexity. This is achieved through a redesigned frequency operator that optimizes high-frequency and low-frequency parameter adjustments, and a simplified frequency-aware attention module. These improvements result in a substantial reduction in model parameters, enabling efficient deployment with only a minimal sacrifice in accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations of standard datasets (NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a superior balance between efficiency and accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with only 60% of the parameters.</p></details> | IEEE FG2025 | None |

Existing models for individuals often fall short in this task due to the inherent distribution discrepancies among entity skeletons, leading to suboptimal backbone optimization. To this end, we introduce a Convex Hull Adaptive Shift based multi-Entity action recognition method (CHASE), which mitigates inter-entity distribution gaps and unbiases subsequent backbones. Specifically, CHASE comprises a learnable parameterized network and an auxiliary objective. The parameterized network achieves plausible, sample-adaptive repositioning of skeleton sequences through two key components. First, the Implicit Convex Hull Constrained Adaptive Shift ensures that the new origin of the coordinate system is within the skeleton convex hull. Second, the Coefficient Learning Block provides a lightweight parameterization of the mapping from skeleton sequences to their specific coefficients in convex combinations. Moreover, to guide the optimization of this network for discrepancy minimization, we propose the Mini-batch Pair-wise Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the additional objective. CHASE operates as a sample-adaptive normalization method to mitigate inter-entity distribution discrepancies, thereby reducing data bias and improving the subsequent classifier's multi-entity action recognition performance. Extensive experiments on six datasets, including NTU Mutual 11/26, H2O, Assembly101, Collective Activity and Volleyball, consistently verify our approach by seamlessly adapting to single-entity backbones and boosting their performance in multi-entity scenarios.

Specifically, most Asian scenarios are far more complex, involving numerous objects with distinct motions and behaviors. Addressing this gap, we present a new dataset, DAVE, designed for evaluating perception methods with high representation of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs: e.g. pedestrians, animals, motorbikes, and bicycles) in complex and unpredictable environments. DAVE is a manually annotated dataset encompassing 16 diverse actor categories (spanning animals, humans, vehicles, etc.) and 16 action types (complex and rare cases like cut-ins, zigzag movement, U-turn, etc.), which require high reasoning ability. DAVE densely annotates over 13 million bounding boxes (bboxes) actors with identification, and more than 1.6 million boxes are annotated with both actor identification and action/behavior details. The videos within DAVE are collected based on a broad spectrum of factors, such as weather conditions, the time of day, road scenarios, and traffic density. DAVE can benchmark video tasks like Tracking, Detection, Spatiotemporal Action Localization, Language-Visual Moment retrieval, and Multi-label Video Action Recognition. Given the critical importance of accurately identifying VRUs to prevent accidents and ensure road safety, in DAVE, vulnerable road users constitute 41.13% of instances, compared to 23.71% in Waymo. DAVE provides an invaluable resource for the development of more sensitive and accurate visual perception algorithms in the complex real world. Our experiments show that existing methods suffer degradation in performance when evaluated on DAVE, highlighting its benefit for future video recognition research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Non-linear Dependency Modeling and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18780v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human skeleton-based action recognition has long been an indispensable aspect of artificial intelligence. Current state-of-the-art methods tend to consider only the dependencies between connected skeletal joints, limiting their ability to capture non-linear dependencies between physically distant joints. Moreover, most existing approaches distinguish action classes by estimating the probability density of motion representations, yet the high-dimensional nature of human motions invokes inherent difficulties in accomplishing such measurements. In this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from two directions: (1) We propose a novel dependency refinement approach that explicitly models dependencies between any pair of joints, effectively transcending the limitations imposed by joint distance. (2) We further propose a framework that utilizes the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion to differentiate action classes without being affected by data dimensionality, and mathematically derive learning objectives guaranteeing precise recognition. Empirically, our approach sets the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition, which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC) layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph convolution operations. Extensive experiments on a challenging hand-to-hand interaction dataset, i.e., the Assembely101 dataset, and two large-scale human-to-human interaction datasets, i.e., NTU60-Interaction and NTU120-Interaction consistently verify the superiority of our proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based and Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

It spurs the need to continually adapt to various users and scenes. Fine-tuning current video understanding models on newly encountered domains often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the models lose their ability to perform well on previously learned scenarios. To address this issue, we formalize the problem of Video Domain Incremental Learning (VDIL), which enables models to learn continually from different domains while maintaining a fixed set of action classes. Existing continual learning research primarily focuses on class-incremental learning, while the domain incremental learning has been largely overlooked in video understanding. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark of domain incremental human action recognition for unconstrained home environments. We design three domain split types (user, scene, hybrid) to systematically assess the challenges posed by domain shifts in real-world home settings. Furthermore, we propose a baseline learning strategy based on replay and reservoir sampling techniques without domain labels to handle scenarios with limited memory and task agnosticism. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our simple sampling and replay strategy outperforms most existing continual learning methods across the three proposed benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

Still, their reliance on floating-point computations leads to high energy consumption, limiting their applicability in battery-powered devices. While energy-efficient, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) struggle to model skeleton dynamics, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose Signal-SGN (Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which utilizes the temporal dimension of skeleton sequences as the spike time steps and represents features as multi-dimensional discrete stochastic signals for temporal-frequency domain feature extraction. It combines the 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) module and the Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) module to extract features from the skeleton represented as spiking form. Additionally, the Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Feature Fusion (MWTF) module is proposed to extract dynamic spiking features and capture frequency-specific characteristics, enhancing classification performance. Experiments across three large-scale datasets reveal Signal-SGN exceeding state-of-the-art SNN-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency while attaining comparable performance with GCN methods and significantly reducing theoretical energy consumption.</p></details> |  | None |

Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 1 figure, conference</p></details> | None |

However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (\textbf{PCAN}) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. \textbf{Firstly}, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. \textbf{Secondly}, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative ($\mathbb{FN}$) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive ($\mathbb{FP}$) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. \textbf{Finally}, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes.

Prevalent methods tackling this problem use differential privacy (DP) or obfuscation techniques to protect the privacy of individuals. In both cases, the utility of the trained model is sacrificed heavily in this process. In this work, we present an anonymization pipeline that replaces sensitive human subjects in video datasets with synthetic avatars within context, employing a combined rendering and stable diffusion-based strategy. Additionally we propose masked differential privacy ({MaskDP}) to protect non-anonymized but privacy sensitive background information. MaskDP allows for controlling sensitive regions where differential privacy is applied, in contrast to applying DP on the entire input. This combined methodology provides strong privacy protection while minimizing the usual performance penalty of privacy preserving methods. Experiments on multiple challenging action recognition datasets demonstrate that our proposed techniques result in better utility-privacy trade-offs compared to standard differentially private training in the especially demanding $\epsilon<1$ regime.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in real-world scenarios, human actions often fall outside the distribution of training data, requiring a model to both recognize in-distribution (ID) actions and reject out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Despite its importance, there has been limited research on OOD detection in human actions. Existing works on OOD detection mainly focus on image data with RGB structure, and many methods are post-hoc in nature. While these methods are convenient and computationally efficient, they often lack sufficient accuracy, fail to consider the exposure of OOD samples, and ignore the application in skeleton structure data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end skeleton-based model called Skeleton-OOD, which is committed to improving the effectiveness of OOD tasks while ensuring the accuracy of ID recognition. Through extensive experiments conducted on NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Kinetics-400 datasets, Skeleton-OOD demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The reliance on high-energy-consuming continuous floating-point operations inherent in GCN-based methods poses significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained, battery-powered edge devices. To address these limitations, MK-SGN, a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network with Multimodal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation, is proposed to leverage the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for skeleton-based action recognition for the first time. By integrating the energy-saving properties of SNNs with the graph representation capabilities of GCNs, MK-SGN achieves significant reductions in energy consumption while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy. Firstly, we formulate a Spiking Multimodal Fusion (SMF) module to effectively fuse multimodal skeleton data represented as spike-form features. Secondly, we propose the Self-Attention Spiking Graph Convolution (SA-SGC) module and the Spiking Temporal Convolution (STC) module, to capture spatial relationships and temporal dynamics of spike-form features. Finally, we propose an integrated knowledge distillation strategy to transfer information from the multimodal GCN to the SGN, incorporating both intermediate-layer distillation and soft-label distillation to enhance the performance of the SGN. MK-SGN exhibits substantial advantages, surpassing state-of-the-art GCN frameworks in energy efficiency and outperforming state-of-the-art SNN frameworks in recognition accuracy. The proposed method achieves a remarkable reduction in energy consumption, exceeding 98\% compared to conventional GCN-based approaches.

As a roadmap to improving spatial intelligence, we introduce SAT, Spatial Aptitude Training, which goes beyond static relative object position questions to the more dynamic tasks. SAT contains 218K question-answer pairs for 22K synthetic scenes across a training and testing set. Generated using a photo-realistic physics engine, our dataset can be arbitrarily scaled and easily extended to new actions, scenes, and 3D assets. We find that even MLMs that perform relatively well on static questions struggle to accurately answer dynamic spatial questions. Further, we show that SAT instruction-tuning data improves not only dynamic spatial reasoning on SAT, but also zero-shot performance on existing real-image spatial benchmarks: $23\%$ on CVBench, $8\%$ on the harder BLINK benchmark, and $18\%$ on VSR. When instruction-tuned on SAT, our 13B model matches larger proprietary MLMs like GPT4-V and Gemini-3-1.0 in spatial reasoning.

| **[Action Recognition based Industrial Safety Violation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05531v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) can save the lives of industry workers and it is a widely used application of computer vision in the large manufacturing industries. However, most of the applications deployed generate a lot of false alarms (violations) because they tend to generalize the requirements of PPE across the industry and tasks. The key to resolving this issue is to understand the action being performed by the worker and customize the inference for the specific PPE requirements of that action. In this paper, we propose a system that employs activity recognition models to first understand the action being performed and then use object detection techniques to check for violations. This leads to a 23% improvement in the F1-score compared to the PPE-based approach on our test dataset of 109 videos.</p></details> |  | None |

We envision a future service scenario where wireless sensing service providers distribute sensing models to users. During usage, users might request new sensing capabilities. For example, if someone is away from home on a business trip or vacation for an extended period, they may want a new sensing capability that can detect falls in elderly parents or grandparents and promptly alert them. In this paper, we propose CCS (continuous customized service), enabling model updates on users' local computing resources without data transmission to the service providers. To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in model updates where updating model parameters to implement new capabilities leads to the loss of existing capabilities we design knowledge distillation and weight alignment modules. These modules enable the sensing model to acquire new capabilities while retaining the existing ones. We conducted extensive experiments on the large-scale XRF55 dataset across Wi-Fi, millimeter-wave radar, and RFID modalities to simulate scenarios where four users sequentially introduced new customized demands. The results affirm that CCS excels in continuous model services across all the above wireless modalities, significantly outperforming existing approaches like OneFi.</p></details> | 9 pages,8 figures | None |

However, a persistent and significant challenge within this field is the accurate prediction of human poses under conditions of severe occlusion. Traditional image-based estimators struggle with heavy occlusions due to a lack of temporal context, resulting in inconsistent predictions. While video-based models benefit from processing temporal data, they encounter limitations when faced with prolonged occlusions that extend over multiple frames. This challenge arises because these models struggle to generalize beyond their training datasets, and the variety of occlusions is hard to capture in the training data. Addressing these challenges, we propose STRIDE (Single-video based TempoRally contInuous Occlusion-Robust 3D Pose Estimation), a novel Test-Time Training (TTT) approach to fit a human motion prior for each video. This approach specifically handles occlusions that were not encountered during the model's training. By employing STRIDE, we can refine a sequence of noisy initial pose estimates into accurate, temporally coherent poses during test time, effectively overcoming the limitations of prior methods. Our framework demonstrates flexibility by being model-agnostic, allowing us to use any off-the-shelf 3D pose estimation method for improving robustness and temporal consistency. We validate STRIDE's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on challenging datasets like Occluded Human3.6M, Human3.6M, and OCMotion, where it not only outperforms existing single-image and video-based pose estimation models but also showcases superior handling of substantial occlusions, achieving fast, robust, accurate, and temporally consistent 3D pose estimates.

In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.</p></details> |  | None |

OAR must operate under stringent latency constraints, making it an indispensable component for real-time feedback for edge computing. Existing methods, which typically rely on the processing of entire video clips, fall short in scenarios requiring immediate recognition. To address this, we designed EdgeOAR, a novel framework specifically designed for OAR on edge devices. EdgeOAR includes the Early Exit-oriented Task-specific Feature Enhancement Module (TFEM), which comprises lightweight submodules to optimize features in both temporal and spatial dimensions. We design an iterative training method to enable TFEM learning features from the beginning of the video. Additionally, EdgeOAR includes an Inverse Information Entropy (IIE) and Modality Consistency (MC)-driven fusion module to fuse features and make better exit decisions. This design overcomes the two main challenges: robust modeling of spatio-temporal action representations with limited initial frames in online video streams and balancing accuracy and efficiency on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments show that on the UCF-101 dataset, our method EdgeOAR reduces latency by 99.23% and energy consumption by 99.28% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. And achieves an adequate accuracy on edge devices.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures | None |

Our approach decomposes skeletal motion analysis into spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal streams, using channel partitioning to capture distinct movement characteristics efficiently. By implementing a structured, multi-directional scanning strategy within SSMs, our model captures local joint interactions and global motion patterns across multiple anatomical body parts. This anatomically-aware decomposition enhances the ability to identify subtle motion patterns critical in medical diagnosis, such as gait anomalies associated with neurological conditions. On public action recognition benchmarks, i.e., NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA, our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy improvements up to $3.2\%$ with lower computational complexity than previous leading transformer-based models. We also introduce a novel medical dataset for motion-based patient neurological disorder analysis to validate our method's potential in automated disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods often focus solely on spatial or temporal features, limiting their ability to comprehend complex human activities fully. Our proposed model integrates joint, motion, and temporal information through a multi-stream fusion architecture. Specifically, it comprises a jointstream for extracting skeleton features, a temporal stream for capturing dynamic temporal features, and an ARN-LSTM block that utilizes Time-Distributed Long Short-Term Memory (TD-LSTM) layers followed by an Attention Relation Network (ARN) to model temporal relations. The outputs from these streams are fused in a fully connected layer to provide the final action prediction.

| **[TAMT: Temporal-Aware Model Tuning for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19041v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Going beyond few-shot action recognition (FSAR), cross-domain FSAR (CDFSAR) has attracted recent research interests by solving the domain gap lying in source-to-target transfer learning. Existing CDFSAR methods mainly focus on joint training of source and target data to mitigate the side effect of domain gap. However, such kind of methods suffer from two limitations: First, pair-wise joint training requires retraining deep models in case of one source data and multiple target ones, which incurs heavy computation cost, especially for large source and small target data. Second, pre-trained models after joint training are adopted to target domain in a straightforward manner, hardly taking full potential of pre-trained models and then limiting recognition performance. To overcome above limitations, this paper proposes a simple yet effective baseline, namely Temporal-Aware Model Tuning (TAMT) for CDFSAR. Specifically, our TAMT involves a decoupled paradigm by performing pre-training on source data and fine-tuning target data, which avoids retraining for multiple target data with single source. To effectively and efficiently explore the potential of pre-trained models in transferring to target domain, our TAMT proposes a Hierarchical Temporal Tuning Network (HTTN), whose core involves local temporal-aware adapters (TAA) and a global temporal-aware moment tuning (GTMT). Particularly, TAA learns few parameters to recalibrate the intermediate features of frozen pre-trained models, enabling efficient adaptation to target domains. Furthermore, GTMT helps to generate powerful video representations, improving match performance on the target domain. Experiments on several widely used video benchmarks show our TAMT outperforms the recently proposed counterparts by 13%$\sim$31%, achieving new state-of-the-art CDFSAR results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EventCrab: Harnessing Frame and Point Synergy for Event-based Action Recognition and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18328v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based Action Recognition (EAR) possesses the advantages of high-temporal resolution capturing and privacy preservation compared with traditional action recognition. Current leading EAR solutions typically follow two regimes: project unconstructed event streams into dense constructed event frames and adopt powerful frame-specific networks, or employ lightweight point-specific networks to handle sparse unconstructed event points directly. However, such two regimes are blind to a fundamental issue: failing to accommodate the unique dense temporal and sparse spatial properties of asynchronous event data. In this article, we present a synergy-aware framework, i.e., EventCrab, that adeptly integrates the "lighter" frame-specific networks for dense event frames with the "heavier" point-specific networks for sparse event points, balancing accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a joint frame-text-point representation space to bridge distinct event frames and points. In specific, to better exploit the unique spatiotemporal relationships inherent in asynchronous event points, we devise two strategies for the "heavier" point-specific embedding: i) a Spiking-like Context Learner (SCL) that extracts contextualized event points from raw event streams. ii) an Event Point Encoder (EPE) that further explores event-point long spatiotemporal features in a Hilbert-scan way. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the significant performance of our proposed EventCrab, particularly gaining improvements of 5.17% on SeAct and 7.01% on HARDVS.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EgoSurgery-Phase: A Dataset of Surgical Phase Recognition from Egocentric Open Surgery Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19644v3)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical phase recognition has gained significant attention due to its potential to offer solutions to numerous demands of the modern operating room. However, most existing methods concentrate on minimally invasive surgery (MIS), leaving surgical phase recognition for open surgery understudied. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the scarcity of publicly available open surgery video datasets for surgical phase recognition. To address this issue, we introduce a new egocentric open surgery video dataset for phase recognition, named EgoSurgery-Phase. This dataset comprises 15 hours of real open surgery videos spanning 9 distinct surgical phases all captured using an egocentric camera attached to the surgeon's head. In addition to video, the EgoSurgery-Phase offers eye gaze. As far as we know, it is the first real open surgery video dataset for surgical phase recognition publicly available. Furthermore, inspired by the notable success of masked autoencoders (MAEs) in video understanding tasks (e.g., action recognition), we propose a gaze-guided masked autoencoder (GGMAE). Considering the regions where surgeons' gaze focuses are often critical for surgical phase recognition (e.g., surgical field), in our GGMAE, the gaze information acts as an empirical semantic richness prior to guiding the masking process, promoting better attention to semantically rich spatial regions. GGMAE significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art recognition method (6.4% in Jaccard) and the masked autoencoder-based method (3.1% in Jaccard) on EgoSurgery-Phase.

Traditional models using RGB and optical flow streams achieve strong performance but at a high computational cost. To address this, we introduce a representation flow algorithm to replace the optical flow branch in the egocentric action recognition model, enabling end-to-end training while reducing computational cost and prediction time. Our model, designed for egocentric action recognition, uses class activation maps (CAMs) to improve accuracy and ConvLSTM for spatio temporal encoding with spatial attention. When evaluated on the GTEA61, EGTEA GAZE+, and HMDB datasets, our model matches the accuracy of the original model on GTEA61 and exceeds it by 0.65% and 0.84% on EGTEA GAZE+ and HMDB, respectively. Prediction runtimes are significantly reduced to 0.1881s, 0.1503s, and 0.1459s, compared to the original model's 101.6795s, 25.3799s, and 203.9958s.

This approach resolves issues associated with real data such as collection and labeling costs, copyright and privacy. We extend this trend to the video domain applying it to the task of action recognition. Employing fractal geometry, we present methods to automatically produce large-scale datasets of short synthetic video clips, which can be utilized for pre-training neural models. The generated video clips are characterized by notable variety, stemmed by the innate ability of fractals to generate complex multi-scale structures. To narrow the domain gap, we further identify key properties of real videos and carefully emulate them during pre-training. Through thorough ablations, we determine the attributes that strengthen downstream results and offer general guidelines for pre-training with synthetic videos. The proposed approach is evaluated by fine-tuning pre-trained models on established action recognition datasets HMDB51 and UCF101 as well as four other video benchmarks related to group action recognition, fine-grained action recognition and dynamic scenes. Compared to standard Kinetics pre-training, our reported results come close and are even superior on a portion of downstream datasets.

Existing methods typically build the skeleton-semantics interactions by uncontrollable mappings and conspicuous representations, thereby can hardly capture the intricate and fine-grained relationship for effective cross-modal transferability. To address these issues, we propose a novel dyNamically Evolving dUal skeleton-semantic syneRgistic framework with the guidance of cOntext-aware side informatioN (dubbed Neuron), to explore more fine-grained cross-modal correspondence from micro to macro perspectives at both spatial and temporal levels, respectively. Concretely, 1) we first construct the spatial-temporal evolving micro-prototypes and integrate dynamic context-aware side information to capture the intricate and synergistic skeleton-semantic correlations step-by-step, progressively refining cross-model alignment; and 2) we introduce the spatial compression and temporal memory mechanisms to guide the growth of spatial-temporal micro-prototypes, enabling them to absorb structure-related spatial representations and regularity-dependent temporal patterns. Notably, such processes are analogous to the learning and growth of neurons, equipping the framework with the capacity to generalize to novel unseen action categories. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |

Many QMIX-based methods introduce monotonicity constraints between the joint action value and individual action values to achieve decentralized execution. However, such constraints limit the representation capacity of value factorization, restricting the joint action values it can represent and hindering the learning of the optimal policy. To address this challenge, we propose the Potentially Optimal Joint Actions Weighted QMIX (POWQMIX) algorithm, which recognizes the potentially optimal joint actions and assigns higher weights to the corresponding losses of these joint actions during training. We theoretically prove that with such a weighted training approach the optimal policy is guaranteed to be recovered.

We construct OccludeNet, a large-scale occluded video dataset that includes both real-world and synthetic occlusion scene videos under various natural environments. OccludeNet features dynamic tracking occlusion, static scene occlusion, and multi-view interactive occlusion, addressing existing gaps in data. Our analysis reveals that occlusion impacts action classes differently, with actions involving low scene relevance and partial body visibility experiencing greater accuracy degradation. To overcome the limitations of current occlusion-focused approaches, we propose a structural causal model for occluded scenes and introduce the Causal Action Recognition (CAR) framework, which employs backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning. This framework enhances key actor information, improving model robustness to occlusion. We anticipate that the challenges posed by OccludeNet will stimulate further exploration of causal relations in occlusion scenarios and encourage a reevaluation of class correlations, ultimately promoting sustainable performance improvements.

Given the motion on each joint in the pose at each time step extracted from 3D pose sequences, we hierarchically pool these joint motions in a bottom-up manner in the encoder, following the kinematic chains in the human body. We also constrain the latent embeddings of the encoder to contain the space of psychologically-motivated affective features underlying the gaits. We train the decoder to reconstruct the motions per joint per time step in a top-down manner from the latent embeddings. For the annotated data, we also train a classifier to map the latent embeddings to emotion labels. Our semi-supervised approach achieves a mean average precision of 0.84 on the Emotion-Gait benchmark dataset, which contains both labeled and unlabeled gaits collected from multiple sources. We outperform current state-of-art algorithms for both emotion recognition and action recognition from 3D gaits by 7%--23% on the absolute.

| **[When Spatial meets Temporal in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15284v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition has made significant strides, but challenges remain in effectively using both spatial and temporal information. While existing methods often focus on either spatial features (e.g., object appearance) or temporal dynamics (e.g., motion), they rarely address the need for a comprehensive integration of both. Capturing the rich temporal evolution of video frames, while preserving their spatial details, is crucial for improving accuracy. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Integration and Motion Enhancement (TIME) layer, a novel preprocessing technique designed to incorporate temporal information. The TIME layer generates new video frames by rearranging the original sequence, preserving temporal order while embedding $N^2$ temporally evolving frames into a single spatial grid of size $N \times N$. This transformation creates new frames that balance both spatial and temporal information, making them compatible with existing video models. When $N=1$, the layer captures rich spatial details, similar to existing methods. As $N$ increases ($N\geq2$), temporal information becomes more prominent, while the spatial information decreases to ensure compatibility with model inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TIME layer by integrating it into popular action recognition models, such as ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, and Video Masked Autoencoders, for both RGB and depth video data. Our experiments show that the TIME layer enhances recognition accuracy, offering valuable insights for video processing tasks.</p></details> | Research report | None |

In the WSLR problem, a method designed for action recognition has achieved the state-of-the-art accuracy. Indeed, it sounds reasonable for an action recognition method to perform well on WSLR because sign language is regarded as an action. However, a careful evaluation of the tasks reveals that the tasks of action recognition and WSLR are inherently different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel WSLR method that takes into account information specifically useful for the WSLR problem. We realize it as a multi-stream neural network (MSNN), which consist of three streams: 1) base stream, 2) local image stream, and 3) skeleton stream. Each stream is designed to handle different types of information. The base stream deals with quick and detailed movements of the hands and body, the local image stream focuses on handshapes and facial expressions, and the skeleton stream captures the relative positions of the body and both hands. This approach allows us to combine various types of data for more comprehensive gesture analysis. Experimental results on the WLASL and MS-ASL datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method; it achieved an improvement of approximately 10\%--15\% in Top-1 accuracy when compared with conventional methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Topological Symmetry Enhanced Graph Convolution for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12560v2)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based action recognition has achieved remarkable performance with the development of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, most of these methods tend to construct complex topology learning mechanisms while neglecting the inherent symmetry of the human body. Additionally, the use of temporal convolutions with certain fixed receptive fields limits their capacity to effectively capture dependencies in time sequences. To address the issues, we (1) propose a novel Topological Symmetry Enhanced Graph Convolution (TSE-GC) to enable distinct topology learning across different channel partitions while incorporating topological symmetry awareness and (2) construct a Multi-Branch Deformable Temporal Convolution (MBDTC) for skeleton-based action recognition. The proposed TSE-GC emphasizes the inherent symmetry of the human body while enabling efficient learning of dynamic topologies. Meanwhile, the design of MBDTC introduces the concept of deformable modeling, leading to more flexible receptive fields and stronger modeling capacity of temporal dependencies. Combining TSE-GC with MBDTC, our final model, TSE-GCN, achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods on three large datasets, NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA. On the cross-subject and cross-set evaluations of NTU RGB+D 120, the accuracies of our model reach 90.0\% and 91.1\%, with 1.1M parameters and 1.38 GFLOPS for one stream.</p></details> |  | None |

Although a wide range of spatial and temporal alignment modules have been proposed, they primarily address spatial or temporal misalignments at the video level, while the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level remain underexplored. Recent studies utilize class prototypes to learn task-specific features but overlook the spatio-temporal relationships across different videos at the task level, especially in the spatial dimension, where these relationships provide rich information. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Motion-Guided Attention Learning method (called DMGAL) for few-shot action recognition, aiming to learn the spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific to the task-specific level. To achieve this, we propose a carefully designed Motion-Guided Attention (MGA) method to identify and correlate motion-related region features from the video level to the task level. Specifically, the Self Motion-Guided Attention module (S-MGA) achieves spatio-temporal relation modeling at the video level by identifying and correlating motion-related region features between different frames within a video. The Cross Motion-Guided Attention module (C-MGA) identifies and correlates motion-related region features between frames of different videos within a specific task to achieve spatio-temporal relationships at the task level. This approach enables the model to construct class prototypes that fully incorporate spatio-temporal relationships from the video-specific level to the task-specific level. We validate the effectiveness of our DMGAL method by employing both fully fine-tuning and adapter-tuning paradigms. The models developed using these paradigms are termed DMGAL-FT and DMGAL-Adapter, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal foundation models in helping us recognize such actions, we present ActionAtlas v1.0, a multiple-choice video question answering benchmark featuring short videos across various sports. Each video in the dataset is paired with a question and four or five choices. The question pinpoints specific individuals, asking which choice "best" describes their action within a certain temporal context. Overall, the dataset includes 934 videos showcasing 580 unique actions across 56 sports, with a total of 1896 actions within choices. Unlike most existing video question answering benchmarks that only cover simplistic actions, often identifiable from a single frame, ActionAtlas focuses on intricate movements and rigorously tests the model's capability to discern subtle differences between moves that look similar within each domain. We evaluate open and proprietary foundation models on this benchmark, finding that the best model, GPT-4o, achieves a maximum accuracy of 45.52%. Meanwhile, Non-expert crowd workers, provided with action description for each choice, achieve 61.64% accuracy, where random chance is approximately 21%. Our findings with state-of-the-art models indicate that having a high frame sampling rate is important for accurately recognizing actions in ActionAtlas, a feature that some leading proprietary video models, such as Gemini, do not include in their default configuration.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a LSTM CrossRWKV (LCR) framework, designed for spatiotemporal representation learning to tackle the video understanding task. Specifically, the proposed linear complexity LCR incorporates a novel Cross RWKV gate to facilitate interaction be tween current frame edge information and past features, enhancing the focus on the subject through edge features and globally aggregating inter-frame features over time. LCR stores long-term mem ory for video processing through an enhanced LSTM recurrent execution mechanism. By leveraging the Cross RWKV gate and recurrent execution, LCR effectively captures both spatial and temporal features. Additionally, the edge information serves as a forgetting gate for LSTM, guiding long-term memory management.Tube masking strategy reduces redundant information in food and reduces overfitting.These advantages enable LSTM CrossRWKV to set a new benchmark in video under standing, offering a scalable and efficient solution for comprehensive video analysis.

| **[C3T: Cross-modal Transfer Through Time for Human Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16803v2)** | 2024-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between modalities using the structure of a unified multimodal representation space for Human Action Recognition (HAR). We formalize and explore an understudied cross-modal transfer setting we term Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA), where the modality used in testing is not used in supervised training, i.e. zero labeled instances of the test modality are available during training. We develop three methods to perform UMA: Student-Teacher (ST), Contrastive Alignment (CA), and Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T). Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets compare these methods to each other in the UMA setting, and to their empirical upper bound in the supervised setting. The results indicate C3T is the most robust and highest performing by at least a margin of 8%, and nears the supervised setting performance even in the presence of temporal noise. This method introduces a novel mechanism for aligning signals across time-varying latent vectors, extracted from the receptive field of temporal convolutions. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for multi-modal learning in various applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AM Flow: Adapters for Temporal Processing in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02065v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, in particular \textit{image} models, have recently gained generalisability and robustness. %are becoming more general and robust by the day. In this work, we propose to exploit such advances in the realm of \textit{video} classification. Video foundation models suffer from the requirement of extensive pretraining and a large training time. Towards mitigating such limitations, we propose "\textit{Attention Map (AM) Flow}" for image models, a method for identifying pixels relevant to motion in each input video frame. In this context, we propose two methods to compute AM flow, depending on camera motion. AM flow allows the separation of spatial and temporal processing, while providing improved results over combined spatio-temporal processing (as in video models). Adapters, one of the popular techniques in parameter efficient transfer learning, facilitate the incorporation of AM flow into pretrained image models, mitigating the need for full-finetuning. We extend adapters to "\textit{temporal processing adapters}" by incorporating a temporal processing unit into the adapters. Our work achieves faster convergence, therefore reducing the number of epochs needed for training. Moreover, we endow an image model with the ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on popular action recognition datasets. This reduces training time and simplifies pretraining. We present experiments on Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and Toyota Smarthome datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art or comparable results.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Badminton Action Recognition with a New Fine-Grained Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12385v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the dynamic and evolving field of computer vision, action recognition has become a key focus, especially with the advent of sophisticated methodologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Convolutional 3D, Transformer, and spatial-temporal feature fusion. These technologies have shown promising results on well-established benchmarks but face unique challenges in real-world applications, particularly in sports analysis, where the precise decomposition of activities and the distinction of subtly different actions are crucial. Existing datasets like UCF101, HMDB51, and Kinetics have offered a diverse range of video data for various scenarios. However, there's an increasing need for fine-grained video datasets that capture detailed categorizations and nuances within broader action categories. In this paper, we introduce the VideoBadminton dataset derived from high-quality badminton footage. Through an exhaustive evaluation of leading methodologies on this dataset, this study aims to advance the field of action recognition, particularly in badminton sports. The introduction of VideoBadminton could not only serve for badminton action recognition but also provide a dataset for recognizing fine-grained actions. The insights gained from these evaluations are expected to catalyze further research in action comprehension, especially within sports contexts.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we take an inspiration from human perception and explore a compositional approach for egocentric video representation. We introduce HENASY (Hierarchical ENtities ASsemblY), which includes a spatiotemporal token grouping mechanism to explicitly assemble dynamically evolving scene entities through time and model their relationship for video representation. By leveraging compositional structure understanding, HENASY possesses strong interpretability via visual grounding with free-form text queries. We further explore a suite of multi-grained contrastive losses to facilitate entity-centric understandings. This comprises three alignment types: video-narration, noun-entity, verb-entities alignments. Our method demonstrates strong interpretability in both quantitative and qualitative experiments; while maintaining competitive performances on five downstream tasks via zero-shot transfer or as video/text representation, including video/text retrieval, action recognition, multi-choice query, natural language query, and moments query.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[STAA: Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution for Real-Time Interpreting Transformer-based Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00630v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, including image and video analysis. However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Recovering Complete Actions for Cross-dataset Skeleton Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23641v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite huge progress in skeleton-based action recognition, its generalizability to different domains remains a challenging issue. In this paper, to solve the skeleton action generalization problem, we present a recover-and-resample augmentation framework based on a novel complete action prior. We observe that human daily actions are confronted with temporal mismatch across different datasets, as they are usually partial observations of their complete action sequences. By recovering complete actions and resampling from these full sequences, we can generate strong augmentations for unseen domains. At the same time, we discover the nature of general action completeness within large datasets, indicated by the per-frame diversity over time. This allows us to exploit two assets of transferable knowledge that can be shared across action samples and be helpful for action completion: boundary poses for determining the action start, and linear temporal transforms for capturing global action patterns. Therefore, we formulate the recovering stage as a two-step stochastic action completion with boundary pose-conditioned extrapolation followed by smooth linear transforms. Both the boundary poses and linear transforms can be efficiently learned from the whole dataset via clustering. We validate our approach on a cross-dataset setting with three skeleton action datasets, outperforming other domain generalization approaches by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

To mediate the communication between participants, we build an AI-enhanced video analysis system incorporating multiple visual analysis modules like person detection, attribute recognition, and action recognition, to assess the performer's body language quality. A two-week field study involving 27 participants shows significant improvements in their social friendships, as indicated by self-reported questionnaires. Moreover, user experiences are investigated to highlight the potential of public video cameras as a novel communication medium for socializing in public spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted as a main track paper by EAI-ArtsIT 2024</p></details> | None |

Given a series of frames as input, our method quickly and accurately extracts time-remaining and quarter values from basketball broadcast scenes. Our work intends to expedite the development of large, multi-modal video datasets to train data-hungry video models in the sports action recognition domain. Our method aligns a pre-labeled corpus of play-by-play annotations containing dense event annotations to video frames, enabling quick retrieval of labeled video segments. Unlike previous methods, we forgo the need to localize game clocks by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box object detector to find semantic text regions directly. Our end-to-end approach improves the generality of our work. Additionally, interpolation and parallelization techniques prepare our pipeline for deployment in a large computing cluster.

| **[Flow Snapshot Neurons in Action: Deep Neural Networks Generalize to Biological Motion Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16493v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological motion perception (BMP) refers to humans' ability to perceive and recognize the actions of living beings solely from their motion patterns, sometimes as minimal as those depicted on point-light displays. While humans excel at these tasks without any prior training, current AI models struggle with poor generalization performance. To close this research gap, we propose the Motion Perceiver (MP). MP solely relies on patch-level optical flows from video clips as inputs. During training, it learns prototypical flow snapshots through a competitive binding mechanism and integrates invariant motion representations to predict action labels for the given video. During inference, we evaluate the generalization ability of all AI models and humans on 62,656 video stimuli spanning 24 BMP conditions using point-light displays in neuroscience. Remarkably, MP outperforms all existing AI models with a maximum improvement of 29% in top-1 action recognition accuracy on these conditions. Moreover, we benchmark all AI models in point-light displays of two standard video datasets in computer vision. MP also demonstrates superior performance in these cases. More interestingly, via psychophysics experiments, we found that MP recognizes biological movements in a way that aligns with human behaviors.

This paper presents a graph convolution network called AtGCN for detecting ataxic gait and identifying its severity using 2D videos. The problem is especially challenging as the deviation of an ataxic gait from a healthy gait is very subtle. The datasets for ataxic gait detection are also quite small, with the largest dataset having only 149 videos. The paper addresses the first problem using special spatiotemporal graph convolution that successfully captures important gait-related features. To handle the small dataset size, a deep spatiotemporal graph convolution network pre-trained on an action recognition dataset is systematically truncated and then fine-tuned on the ataxia dataset to obtain the AtGCN model. The paper also presents an augmentation strategy that segments a video sequence into multiple gait cycles. The proposed AtGCN model then operates on a graph of body part locations belonging to a single gait cycle. The evaluation results support the strength of the proposed AtGCN model, as it outperforms the state-of-the-art in detection and severity prediction with an accuracy of 93.46% and a MAE of 0.4169, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite diverse application scenarios, systems are typically evaluated on traditional classification tasks, e.g., action recognition or temporal action segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel evaluation dataset, ProMQA, to measure system advancements in application-oriented scenarios. ProMQA consists of 401 multimodal procedural QA pairs on user recording of procedural activities coupled with their corresponding instruction. For QA annotation, we take a cost-effective human-LLM collaborative approach, where the existing annotation is augmented with LLM-generated QA pairs that are later verified by humans. We then provide the benchmark results to set the baseline performance on ProMQA. Our experiment reveals a significant gap between human performance and that of current systems, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. We hope our dataset sheds light on new aspects of models' multimodal understanding capabilities.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures | None |

Each teacher is first trained from scratch on its own dataset. Then, the teachers are combined into a joint architecture, which fuses the features of all teachers at multiple representation levels. The joint teacher architecture is fine-tuned on samples from all datasets, thus gathering useful generic information from all data samples. Finally, we employ a multi-level feature distillation procedure to transfer the knowledge to a student model for each of the considered datasets. We conduct image classification experiments on seven benchmarks, and action recognition experiments on three benchmarks. To illustrate the power of our feature distillation procedure, the student architectures are chosen to be identical to those of the individual teachers. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we combine teachers with distinct architectures. We show that our novel Multi-Level Feature Distillation (MLFD) can significantly surpass equivalent architectures that are either trained on individual datasets, or jointly trained on all datasets at once. Furthermore, we confirm that each step of the proposed training procedure is well motivated by a comprehensive ablation study.

In this study, we present a novel approach to improve action recognition by exploiting the hierarchical organization of actions and by incorporating contextualized textual information, including location and prior actions to reflect the sequential context. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel transformer architecture tailored for action recognition that utilizes both visual and textual features. Visual features are obtained from RGB and optical flow data, while text embeddings represent contextual information. Furthermore, we define a joint loss function to simultaneously train the model for both coarse and fine-grained action recognition, thereby exploiting the hierarchical nature of actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we extend the Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed (TSU) dataset to introduce action hierarchies, introducing the Hierarchical TSU dataset. We also conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of different methods for integrating contextual and hierarchical data on action recognition performance. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms pre-trained SOTA methods when trained with the same hyperparameters. Moreover, they also show a 17.12% improvement in top-1 accuracy over the equivalent fine-grained RGB version when using ground-truth contextual information, and a 5.33% improvement when contextual information is obtained from actual predictions.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Idempotent Unsupervised Representation Learning for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20349v1)** | 2024-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, as a powerful technique for generation, also gradually become a critical tool for recognition tasks. However, in skeleton-based action recognition, the features obtained from existing pre-trained generative methods contain redundant information unrelated to recognition, which contradicts the nature of the skeleton's spatially sparse and temporally consistent properties, leading to undesirable performance. To address this challenge, we make efforts to bridge the gap in theory and methodology and propose a novel skeleton-based idempotent generative model (IGM) for unsupervised representation learning. More specifically, we first theoretically demonstrate the equivalence between generative models and maximum entropy coding, which demonstrates a potential route that makes the features of generative models more compact by introducing contrastive learning. To this end, we introduce the idempotency constraint to form a stronger consistency regularization in the feature space, to push the features only to maintain the critical information of motion semantics for the recognition task. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D and PKUMMD, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. On the NTU 60 xsub dataset, we observe a performance improvement from 84.6$\%$ to 86.2$\%$. Furthermore, in zero-shot adaptation scenarios, our model demonstrates significant efficacy by achieving promising results in cases that were previously unrecognizable.

Furthermore, we jointly profile FMs' efficacy and efficiency when adapting to general video understanding tasks using cost measurements during both training and inference. Our main findings areas follows. First, task-specialized models significantly outperform the seven FMs studied in this work, in sharp contrast to what FMs have achieved in natural language and image understanding. Second, video-native FMs, whose pretraining data mainly contains the video modality, are generally better than image-native FMs in classifying motion-rich videos, localizing actions in time, and understanding a video of more than one action. Third, the video-native FMs can perform well on video tasks under light adaptations to downstream tasks (e.g., freezing the FM backbones), while image-native FMs win in full end-to-end finetuning. The first two observations reveal the need and tremendous opportunities to conduct research on video-focused FMs, and the last confirms that both tasks and adaptation methods matter when it comes to the evaluation of FMs. Our code is released under: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/videoglue.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR | [Code Link](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) |

Recent progress in language modeling presents opportunities to advance zero-shot video analysis, but constructing an effective semantic space relating action classes remains challenging. We address this by introducing a novel dataset, Stories, which contains rich textual descriptions for diverse action classes extracted from WikiHow articles. For each class, we extract multi-sentence narratives detailing the necessary steps, scenes, objects, and verbs that characterize the action. This contextual data enables modeling of nuanced relationships between actions, paving the way for zero-shot transfer. We also propose an approach that harnesses Stories to improve feature generation for training zero-shot classification. Without any target dataset fine-tuning, our method achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks, improving top-1 accuracy by up to 6.1%. We believe Stories provides a valuable resource that can catalyze progress in zero-shot action recognition.

Such a scenario, despite its practical relevance, is rarely addressed in existing self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods. To empower models with the capacity to address occlusion, we propose a simple and effective method. We first pre-train using occluded skeleton sequences, then use k-means clustering (KMeans) on sequence embeddings to group semantically similar samples. Next, we propose KNN-Imputation to fill in missing skeleton data based on the closest sample neighbors. Imputing incomplete skeleton sequences to create relatively complete sequences as input provides significant benefits to existing skeleton-based self-supervised methods. Meanwhile, building on the state-of-the-art Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL), we introduce an Occluded Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (OPSTL) framework. This enhancement utilizes Adaptive Spatial Masking (ASM) for better use of high-quality, intact skeletons.

| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Action Recognition via Self-Ensembling and Conditional Embedding Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17489v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning-based wearable human action recognition (wHAR) have improved the capture and classification of complex motions, but adoption remains limited due to the lack of expert annotations and domain discrepancies from user variations. Limited annotations hinder the model's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution samples. While data augmentation can improve generalizability, unsupervised augmentation techniques must be applied carefully to avoid introducing noise. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses domain discrepancies by aligning conditional distributions with labeled target samples, but vanilla pseudo-labeling can lead to error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose $\mu$DAR, a novel joint optimization architecture comprised of three functions: (i) consistency regularizer between augmented samples to improve model classification generalizability, (ii) temporal ensemble for robust pseudo-label generation and (iii) conditional distribution alignment to improve domain generalizability. The temporal ensemble works by aggregating predictions from past epochs to smooth out noisy pseudo-label predictions, which are then used in the conditional distribution alignment module to minimize kernel-based class-wise conditional maximum mean discrepancy ($k$CMMD) between the source and target feature space to learn a domain invariant embedding. The consistency-regularized augmentations ensure that multiple augmentations of the same sample share the same labels; this results in (a) strong generalization with limited source domain samples and (b) consistent pseudo-label generation in target samples. The novel integration of these three modules in $\mu$DAR results in a range of $\approx$ 4-12% average macro-F1 score improvement over six state-of-the-art UDA methods in four benchmark wHAR datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, 2024</p></details> | None |

A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17149v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have recently shown significant improvement in performance across various downstream tasks. However, whether such foundation models significantly improve more complex fine-grained action recognition tasks is still an open question. To answer this question and better find out the future research direction on human behavior analysis in-the-wild, this paper provides a large-scale study and insight on current state-of-the-art vision foundation models by comparing their transfer ability onto zero-shot and frame-wise action recognition tasks.

| **[Selective Volume Mixup for Video Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09534v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers have convincingly demonstrated high learning capability for video action recognition on large datasets. Nevertheless, deep models often suffer from the overfitting effect on small-scale datasets with a limited number of training videos. A common solution is to exploit the existing image augmentation strategies for each frame individually including Mixup, Cutmix, and RandAugment, which are not particularly optimized for video data. In this paper, we propose a novel video augmentation strategy named Selective Volume Mixup (SV-Mix) to improve the generalization ability of deep models with limited training videos. SV-Mix devises a learnable selective module to choose the most informative volumes from two videos and mixes the volumes up to achieve a new training video. Technically, we propose two new modules, i.e., a spatial selective module to select the local patches for each spatial position, and a temporal selective module to mix the entire frames for each timestamp and maintain the spatial pattern. At each time, we randomly choose one of the two modules to expand the diversity of training samples. The selective modules are jointly optimized with the video action recognition framework to find the optimal augmentation strategy. We empirically demonstrate the merits of the SV-Mix augmentation on a wide range of video action recognition benchmarks and consistently boot the performances of both CNN-based and transformer-based models.</p></details> |  | None |

Most HAR algorithms are developed from RGB images, which capture detailed visual information. However, these algorithms raise concerns in privacy-sensitive environments due to the recording of identifiable features. Event cameras offer a promising solution by capturing scene brightness changes sparsely at the pixel level, without capturing full images. Moreover, event cameras have high dynamic ranges that can effectively handle scenarios with complex lighting conditions, such as low light or high contrast environments. However, using event cameras introduces challenges in modeling the spatially sparse and high temporal resolution event data for HAR. To address these issues, we propose the SpikMamba framework, which combines the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks and the long sequence modeling capability of Mamba to efficiently capture global features from spatially sparse and high a temporal resolution event data. Additionally, to improve the locality of modeling, a spiking window-based linear attention mechanism is used. Extensive experiments show that SpikMamba achieves remarkable recognition performance, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.45%, 7.22%, 0.15%, and 3.92% on the PAF, HARDVS, DVS128, and E-FAction datasets, respectively.

In the multi-label atomic activity recognition task, the robustness of visual feature extraction remains a key challenge, which directly affects the model performance and generalization ability. To cope with these issues, our team optimized three aspects: data processing, model and post-processing. Firstly, the appropriate resolution and video sampling strategy are selected, and a fixed sampling strategy is set on the validation and test sets. Secondly, in terms of model training, the team selects a variety of visual backbone networks for feature extraction, and then introduces the action-slot model, which is trained on the training and validation sets, and reasoned on the test set. Finally, for post-processing, the team combined the strengths and weaknesses of different models for weighted fusion, and the final mAP on the test set was 58%, which is 4% higher than the challenge baseline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Storyboard guided Alignment for Fine-grained Video Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14238v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained video action recognition can be conceptualized as a video-text matching problem. Previous approaches often rely on global video semantics to consolidate video embeddings, which can lead to misalignment in video-text pairs due to a lack of understanding of action semantics at an atomic granularity level. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-granularity framework based on two observations: (i) videos with different global semantics may share similar atomic actions or appearances, and (ii) atomic actions within a video can be momentary, slow, or even non-directly related to the global video semantics. Inspired by the concept of storyboarding, which disassembles a script into individual shots, we enhance global video semantics by generating fine-grained descriptions using a pre-trained large language model. These detailed descriptions capture common atomic actions depicted in videos. A filtering metric is proposed to select the descriptions that correspond to the atomic actions present in both the videos and the descriptions. By employing global semantics and fine-grained descriptions, we can identify key frames in videos and utilize them to aggregate embeddings, thereby making the embedding more accurate. Extensive experiments on various video action recognition datasets demonstrate superior performance of our proposed method in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing work has focused on multi-view action recognition in a narrow area with strong labels available, where the onset and offset of each action are labeled at the frame-level. This study focuses on real-world scenarios where cameras are distributed to capture a wide-range area with only weak labels available at the video-level. We propose the method named Multi-view Action Selection Learning (MultiASL), which leverages action selection learning to enhance view fusion by selecting the most useful information from different viewpoints. The proposed method includes a Multi-view Spatial-Temporal Transformer video encoder to extract spatial and temporal features from multi-viewpoint videos. Action Selection Learning is employed at the frame-level, using pseudo ground-truth obtained from weak labels at the video-level, to identify the most relevant frames for action recognition.

Similarly, continual learning aims to develop models that can generalize effectively and learn new tasks without forgetting the ones previously learned. The generalization goals of zero-shot and continual learning are closely aligned, however techniques from continual learning have not been applied to zero-shot action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on continual learning to address zero-shot action recognition. This model, which we call {\em Generative Iterative Learning} (GIL) uses a memory of synthesized features of past classes, and combines these synthetic features with real ones from novel classes. The memory is used to train a classification model, ensuring a balanced exposure to both old and new classes. Experiments demonstrate that {\em GIL} improves generalization in unseen classes, achieving a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot recognition across multiple benchmarks. Importantly, {\em GIL} also boosts performance in the more challenging generalized zero-shot setting, where models need to retain knowledge about classes seen before fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACCV 2024</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often fall short in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex, real-time environments where player movements are frequently occluded or involve intricate interactions. To overcome these challenges, we propose the EITNet model, a deep learning framework that combines EfficientDet for object detection, I3D for spatiotemporal feature extraction, and TimeSformer for temporal analysis, all integrated with IoT technology for seamless real-time data collection and processing. Our contributions include developing a robust architecture that improves recognition accuracy to 92\%, surpassing the baseline EfficientDet model's 87\%, and reducing loss to below 5.0 compared to EfficientDet's 9.0 over 50 epochs. Furthermore, the integration of IoT technology enhances real-time data processing, providing adaptive insights into player performance and strategy. The paper details the design and implementation of EITNet, experimental validation, and a comprehensive evaluation against existing models. The results demonstrate EITNet's potential to significantly advance automated sports analysis and optimize data utilization for player performance and strategy improvement.</p></details> | pages | None |

Tracking the motion and identifying the action being performed on a real time basis is necessary for critical security systems. In entertainment, especially gaming, the need for immediate responses for actions and gestures are paramount for the success of that system. We show that Motion History image has been a well established framework to capture the temporal and activity information in multi dimensional detail enabling various usecases including classification. We utilize MHI to produce sample data to train a classifier and demonstrate its effectiveness for action classification across six different activities in a single multi-action video. We analyze the classifier performance and identify usecases where MHI struggles to generate the appropriate activity image and discuss mechanisms and future work to overcome those limitations.</p></details> | 5 pages, 9 images | None |

Despite significant improvements brought by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), these models suffer performance declines when trained with discontinuous video frames, which is a frequent scenario in real-world settings. This decline primarily results from the loss of temporal continuity, which is crucial for understanding the semantics of human actions. To overcome this issue, we introduce the 4A (Action Animation-based Augmentation Approach) pipeline, which employs a series of sophisticated techniques: starting with 2D human pose estimation from RGB videos, followed by Quaternion-based Graph Convolution Network for joint orientation and trajectory prediction, and Dynamic Skeletal Interpolation for creating smoother, diversified actions using game engine technology. This innovative approach generates realistic animations in varied game environments, viewed from multiple viewpoints. In this way, our method effectively bridges the domain gap between virtual and real-world data. In experimental evaluations, the 4A pipeline achieves comparable or even superior performance to traditional training approaches using real-world data, while requiring only 10% of the original data volume. Additionally, our approach demonstrates enhanced performance on In-the-wild videos, marking a significant advancement in the field of action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI24, model and code are available at https://github.com/xingyu-song/4A</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/xingyu-song/4A) |

However, the majority of public benchmarks were constructed around activities of daily living and annotated at a rather coarse-grained level, which lacks diversity in domain-specific datasets, especially for rarely seen domains. In this paper, we introduced Human Stone Toolmaking Action Grammar (HSTAG), a meticulously annotated video dataset showcasing previously undocumented stone toolmaking behaviors, which can be used for investigating the applications of advanced artificial intelligence techniques in understanding a rapid succession of complex interactions between two hand-held objects. HSTAG consists of 18,739 video clips that record 4.5 hours of experts' activities in stone toolmaking. Its unique features include (i) brief action durations and frequent transitions, mirroring the rapid changes inherent in many motor behaviors; (ii) multiple angles of view and switches among multiple tools, increasing intra-class variability; (iii) unbalanced class distributions and high similarity among different action sequences, adding difficulty in capturing distinct patterns for each action.

In order to automatically recognize both the label and the temporal structure in sequence of human-object interaction, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN), which employs a pyramidal encoder-decoder architecture consisting of an attention based graph convolution network and a temporal pyramid pooling module for downsampling and upsampling interaction sequence on the temporal axis, respectively. The system represents the 2D or 3D spatial relation of human and objects from the detection results in video data as a graph. To learn the human-object relations, a new attention graph convolutional network is trained to extract condensed information from the graph representation. To segment action into sub-actions, a novel temporal pyramid pooling module is proposed, which upsamples compressed features back to the original time scale and classifies actions per frame. We explore various attention layers, namely spatial attention, temporal attention and channel attention, and combine different upsampling decoders to test the performance on action recognition and segmentation. We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets in the field of human-object interaction recognition, i.e. Bimanual Actions and IKEA Assembly datasets. We demonstrate that our classifier significantly improves both framewise action recognition and segmentation, e.g., F1 micro and F1@50 scores on Bimanual Actions dataset are improved by $4.3\%$ and $8.5\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, IROS 2022 conference</p></details> | None |

They offer promising advantages, namely a high dynamic range, low latency, and minimal motion blur. Modern computer vision algorithms often rely on artificial neural network approaches, which require image-like representations of the data and cannot fully exploit the characteristics of event data. We propose approaches to action recognition based on the Fourier Transform. The approaches are intended to recognize oscillating motion patterns commonly present in nature. In particular, we apply our approaches to a recent dataset of breeding penguins annotated for "ecstatic display", a behavior where the observed penguins flap their wings at a certain frequency. We find that our approaches are both simple and effective, producing slightly lower results than a deep neural network (DNN) while relying just on a tiny fraction of the parameters compared to the DNN (five orders of magnitude fewer parameters). They work well despite the uncontrolled, diverse data present in the dataset. We hope this work opens a new perspective on event-based processing and action recognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

However, we often fail to fully unleash their potential when adapting them for new concept understanding due to limited information on new classes. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework, AWT (Augment, Weight, then Transport). AWT comprises three key components: augmenting inputs with diverse visual perspectives and enriched class descriptions through image transformations and language models; dynamically weighting inputs based on the prediction entropy; and employing optimal transport to mine semantic correlations in the vision-language space. AWT can be seamlessly integrated into various VLMs, enhancing their zero-shot capabilities without additional training and facilitating few-shot learning through an integrated multimodal adapter module. We verify AWT in multiple challenging scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot image classification, zero-shot video action recognition, and out-of-distribution generalization. AWT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in each setting. In addition, our extensive studies further demonstrate AWT's effectiveness and adaptability across different VLMs, architectures, and scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> | None |

While several studies have recognized this advantage, most of them resort to full-parameter fine-tuning to make CLIP's visual encoder adapt to the FSAR data, which not only costs high computations but also overlooks the potential of the visual encoder to engage in temporal modeling and focus on targeted semantics directly. To tackle these issues, we introduce MA-FSAR, a framework that employs the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique to enhance the CLIP visual encoder in terms of action-related temporal and semantic representations. Our solution involves a Fine-grained Multimodal Adaptation, which is different from the previous attempts of PEFT in regular action recognition. Specifically, we first insert a Global Temporal Adaptation that only receives the class token to capture global motion cues efficiently. Then these outputs integrate with visual tokens to enhance local temporal dynamics by a Local Multimodal Adaptation, which incorporates text features unique to the FSAR support set branch to highlight fine-grained semantics related to actions. In addition to these token-level designs, we propose a prototype-level text-guided construction module to further enrich the temporal and semantic characteristics of video prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance in various tasks using minor trainable parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the empirical covariance matrix on which the VNNs operate may contain many spurious correlations, making VNNs' performance inconsistent due to these noisy estimates and decreasing their computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we put forth Sparse coVariance Neural Networks (S-VNNs), a framework that applies sparsification techniques on the sample covariance matrix before convolution. When the true covariance matrix is sparse, we propose hard and soft thresholding to improve covariance estimation and reduce computational cost. Instead, when the true covariance is dense, we propose stochastic sparsification where data correlations are dropped in probability according to principled strategies. We show that S-VNNs are more stable than nominal VNNs as well as sparse principal component analysis. By analyzing the impact of sparsification on their behavior, we provide novel connections between S-VNN stability and data distribution. We support our theoretical findings with experimental results on various application scenarios, ranging from brain data to human action recognition, and show an improved task performance, stability, and computational efficiency of S-VNNs compared with nominal VNNs.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods for extracting motion, used in tasks such as action recognition, often rely on visual contents rather than precise motion features. This phenomenon is referred to as 'blind motion extraction' behavior, which proves inefficient in capturing motions of interest due to a lack of motion-guided cues. Recently, attention mechanisms have enhanced many computer vision tasks by effectively highlighting salient visual areas. Inspired by this, we propose a modified Sigmoid function with learnable slope and shift parameters as an attention mechanism to modulate motion signals from frame differencing maps. This approach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of motion-related video content. To ensure temporal continuity and smoothness of the attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation regularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving important ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention maps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of interest over time. These highlighted motions, termed video motion prompts, are subsequently used as inputs to the model instead of the original video frames. We formalize this process as a motion prompt layer and incorporate the regularization term into the loss function to learn better motion prompts. This layer serves as an adapter between the model and the video data, bridging the gap between traditional 'blind motion extraction' and the extraction of relevant motions of interest. We show that our lightweight, plug-and-play motion prompt layer seamlessly integrates into models like SlowFast, X3D, and TimeSformer, enhancing performance on benchmarks such as FineGym and MPII Cooking 2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 16th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2024)</p></details> | None |

To achieve these positive and negative pairs, existing weak/strong data augmentation methods have to randomly change the appearance of skeletons for indirectly pursuing semantic perturbations. However, such approaches have two limitations: i) solely perturbing appearance cannot well capture the intrinsic semantic information of skeletons, and ii) randomly perturbation may change the original positive/negative pairs to soft positive/negative ones. To address the above dilemma, we start the first attempt to explore an attack-based augmentation scheme that additionally brings in direct semantic perturbation, for constructing hard positive pairs and further assisting in constructing hard negative pairs. In particular, we propose a novel Attack-Augmentation Mixing-Contrastive skeletal representation learning (A$^2$MC) to contrast hard positive features and hard negative features for learning more robust skeleton representations. In A$^2$MC, Attack-Augmentation (Att-Aug) is designed to collaboratively perform targeted and untargeted perturbations of skeletons via attack and augmentation respectively, for generating high-quality hard positive features. Meanwhile, Positive-Negative Mixer (PNM) is presented to mix hard positive features and negative features for generating hard negative features, which are adopted for updating the mixed memory banks. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that A$^2$MC is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.

These methods usually use multiple data streams (i.e., joint, motion, and bone) for ensemble learning, meanwhile, how to construct a discriminative feature space within a single stream and effectively aggregate the information from multiple streams remains an open problem. To this end, this paper first applies a new contrastive learning method called BYOL to learn from skeleton data, and then formulate SkeletonBYOL as a simple yet effective baseline for self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. Inspired by SkeletonBYOL, this paper further presents a Cross-Model and Cross-Stream (CMCS) framework. This framework combines Cross-Model Adversarial Learning (CMAL) and Cross-Stream Collaborative Learning (CSCL). Specifically, CMAL learns single-stream representation by cross-model adversarial loss to obtain more discriminative features. To aggregate and interact with multi-stream information, CSCL is designed by generating similarity pseudo label of ensemble learning as supervision and guiding feature generation for individual streams. Extensive experiments on three datasets verify the complementary properties between CMAL and CSCL and also verify that the proposed method can achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods using various evaluation protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Levigty/CMCS .

However, the paradigm of "image pre-training followed by video fine-tuning" for high-dimensional video data inevitably poses significant performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, in the medical domain, many surgical video tasks encounter additional challenges posed by the limited availability of video data and the necessity for comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling. Recently, Parameter-Efficient Image-to-Video Transfer Learning has emerged as an efficient and effective paradigm for video action recognition tasks, which employs image-level pre-trained models with promising feature transferability and involves cross-modality temporal modeling with minimal fine-tuning. Nevertheless, the effectiveness and generalizability of this paradigm within intricate surgical domain remain unexplored. In this paper, we delve into a novel problem of efficiently adapting image-level pre-trained models to specialize in fine-grained surgical phase recognition, termed as Parameter-Efficient Image-to-Surgical-Video Transfer Learning. Firstly, we develop a parameter-efficient transfer learning benchmark SurgPETL for surgical phase recognition, and conduct extensive experiments with three advanced methods based on ViTs of two distinct scales pre-trained on five large-scale natural and medical datasets. Then, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Adaptation module, integrating a standard spatial adapter with a novel temporal adapter to capture detailed spatial features and establish connections across temporal sequences for robust spatial-temporal modeling.

Unlike approaches that learn a fixed representation of the output classes, we generate at inference time a model tailored to a query classification task. To generate task-based zero-shot classifiers, we train a hypernetwork that receives class descriptions and outputs a multi-class model. The hypernetwork is designed to be equivariant with respect to the set of descriptions and the classification layer, thus obeying the symmetries of the problem and improving generalization. Our approach generates non-linear classifiers, handles rich textual descriptions, and may be adapted to produce lightweight models efficient enough for on-device applications. We evaluate this approach in a series of zero-shot classification tasks, for image, point-cloud, and action recognition, using a range of text descriptions: From single words to rich descriptions. Our results demonstrate strong improvements over previous approaches, showing that zero-shot learning can be applied with little training data. Furthermore, we conduct an analysis with foundational vision and language models, demonstrating that they struggle to generalize when describing what attributes the class lacks.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce a hierarchy and attention guided cross-masking framework (HA-CM) that applies masking to skeleton sequences from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, in spatial graphs, we utilize hyperbolic space to maintain joint distinctions and effectively preserve the hierarchical structure of high-dimensional skeletons, employing joint hierarchy as the masking criterion. In temporal flows, we substitute traditional distance metrics with the global attention of joints for masking, addressing the convergence of distances in high-dimensional space and the lack of a global perspective. Additionally, we incorporate cross-contrast loss based on the cross-masking framework into the loss function to enhance the model's learning of instance-level features. HA-CM shows efficiency and universality on three public large-scale datasets, NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD. The source code of our HA-CM is available at https://github.com/YinxPeng/HA-CM-main.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,6 figures,IEEE Trans</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/YinxPeng/HA-CM-main) |

Despite this progress, the fragmentation in tasks like action recognition, procedure learning, and moment retrieval, \etc, coupled with inconsistent annotations and isolated model development, hinders a holistic interpretation of video content. In response, we introduce the EAGLE (Egocentric AGgregated Language-video Engine) model and the EAGLE-400K dataset to provide a unified framework that integrates various egocentric video understanding tasks. EAGLE-400K, the \textit{first} large-scale instruction-tuning dataset tailored for egocentric video, features 400K diverse samples to enhance a broad spectrum of tasks from activity recognition to procedure knowledge learning. Moreover, EAGLE, a strong video multimodal large language model (MLLM), is designed to effectively capture both spatial and temporal information. In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics designed to facilitate a thorough assessment of MLLM for egocentric video understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate EAGLE's superior performance over existing models, highlighting its ability to balance task-specific understanding with holistic video interpretation. With EAGLE, we aim to pave the way for research opportunities and practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | Accepted by ACMMM 24 | None |
| **[Path-adaptive Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for Event-based Recognition with Arbitrary Duration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16953v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture the intensity changes asynchronously and output event streams with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution. To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies. To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies. Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences. To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames. On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features. This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies. Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features. Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | First version | None |
| **[How Effective are Self-Supervised Models for Contact Identification in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00498v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of video content via Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models has unveiled a dynamic field of study, emphasizing both the complex challenges and unique opportunities inherent in this area. Despite the growing body of research, the ability of SSL models to detect physical contacts in videos remains largely unexplored, particularly the effectiveness of methods such as downstream supervision with linear probing or full fine-tuning. This work aims to bridge this gap by employing eight different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based video SSL models to identify instances of physical contact within video sequences specifically. The Something-Something v2 (SSv2) and Epic-Kitchen (EK-100) datasets were chosen for evaluating these approaches due to the promising results on UCF101 and HMDB51, coupled with their limited prior assessment on SSv2 and EK-100. Additionally, these datasets feature diverse environments and scenarios, essential for testing the robustness and accuracy of video-based models. This approach not only examines the effectiveness of each model in recognizing physical contacts but also explores the performance in the action recognition downstream task. By doing so, valuable insights into the adaptability of SSL models in interpreting complex, dynamic visual information are contributed.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Dual Visual-Text Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14336v1)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot action recognition, which addresses the issue of scalability and generalization in action recognition and allows the models to adapt to new and unseen actions dynamically, is an important research topic in computer vision communities. The key to zero-shot action recognition lies in aligning visual features with semantic vectors representing action categories. Most existing methods either directly project visual features onto the semantic space of text category or learn a shared embedding space between the two modalities. However, a direct projection cannot accurately align the two modalities, and learning robust and discriminative embedding space between visual and text representations is often difficult. To address these issues, we introduce Dual Visual-Text Alignment (DVTA) for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition. The DVTA consists of two alignment modules-Direct Alignment (DA) and Augmented Alignment (AA)-along with a designed Semantic Description Enhancement (SDE). The DA module maps the skeleton features to the semantic space through a specially designed visual projector, followed by the SDE, which is based on cross-attention to enhance the connection between skeleton and text, thereby reducing the gap between modalities. The AA module further strengthens the learning of the embedding space by utilizing deep metric learning to learn the similarity between skeleton and text. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances on several popular zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Egocentric zone-aware action recognition across environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14205v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human activities exhibit a strong correlation between actions and the places where these are performed, such as washing something at a sink. More specifically, in daily living environments we may identify particular locations, hereinafter named activity-centric zones, which may afford a set of homogeneous actions. Their knowledge can serve as a prior to favor vision models to recognize human activities. However, the appearance of these zones is scene-specific, limiting the transferability of this prior information to unfamiliar areas and domains. This problem is particularly relevant in egocentric vision, where the environment takes up most of the image, making it even more difficult to separate the action from the context. In this paper, we discuss the importance of decoupling the domain-specific appearance of activity-centric zones from their universal, domain-agnostic representations, and show how the latter can improve the cross-domain transferability of Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR) models. We validate our solution on the EPIC-Kitchens-100 and Argo1M datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://gabrielegoletto.github.io/EgoZAR/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://gabrielegoletto.github.io/EgoZAR) |

The dataset comes with a) full-body ground-truth motion; b) multiple multimodal egocentric data from Project Aria devices with videos, eye tracking, IMUs and etc; and c) a third-person perspective by an additional observer. All devices are precisely synchronized and localized in on metric 3D world. We derive hierarchical protocol to add in-context language descriptions of human motion, from fine-grain motion narration, to simplified atomic action and high-level activity summarization. To the best of our knowledge, Nymeria dataset is the world's largest collection of human motion in the wild; first of its kind to provide synchronized and localized multi-device multimodal egocentric data; and the world's largest motion-language dataset. It provides 300 hours of daily activities from 264 participants across 50 locations, total travelling distance over 399Km. The language descriptions contain 301.5K sentences in 8.64M words from a vocabulary size of 6545. To demonstrate the potential of the dataset, we evaluate several SOTA algorithms for egocentric body tracking, motion synthesis, and action recognition. Data and code are open-sourced for research (c.f. https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/nymeria).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interpretable Action Recognition on Hard to Classify Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13091v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a human-like interpretable model of video understanding. Humans recognise complex activities in video by recognising critical spatio-temporal relations among explicitly recognised objects and parts, for example, an object entering the aperture of a container. To mimic this we build on a model which uses positions of objects and hands, and their motions, to recognise the activity taking place. To improve this model we focussed on three of the most confused classes (for this model) and identified that the lack of 3D information was the major problem. To address this we extended our basic model by adding 3D awareness in two ways: (1) A state-of-the-art object detection model was fine-tuned to determine the difference between "Container" and "NotContainer" in order to integrate object shape information into the existing object features. (2) A state-of-the-art depth estimation model was used to extract depth values for individual objects and calculate depth relations to expand the existing relations used our interpretable model. These 3D extensions to our basic model were evaluated on a subset of three superficially similar "Putting" actions from the Something-Something-v2 dataset. The results showed that the container detector did not improve performance, but the addition of depth relations made a significant improvement to performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, This manuscript has been accepted at the Human-inspired Computer Vision (HCV) ECCV 2024 Workshop. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2107.05319</p></details> | None |
| **[Modelling Spatio-Temporal Interactions For Compositional Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02673v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans have the natural ability to recognize actions even if the objects involved in the action or the background are changed. Humans can abstract away the action from the appearance of the objects which is referred to as compositionality of actions. We focus on this compositional aspect of action recognition to impart human-like generalization abilities to video action-recognition models. First, we propose an interaction model that captures both fine-grained and long-range interactions between hands and objects. Frame-wise hand-object interactions capture fine-grained movements, while long-range interactions capture broader context and disambiguate actions across time. Second, in order to provide additional contextual cues to differentiate similar actions, we infuse the interaction tokens with global motion information from video tokens. The final global motion refined interaction tokens are used for compositional action recognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach on the compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-art result outperforming recent object-centric methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[Distillation-free Scaling of Large SSMs for Images and Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11867v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs), exemplified by S4, have introduced a novel context modeling method by integrating state-space techniques into deep learning. However, they struggle with global context modeling due to their data-independent matrices. The Mamba model addressed this with data-dependent variants via the S6 selective-scan algorithm, enhancing context modeling, especially for long sequences. However, Mamba-based architectures are difficult to scale with respect to the number of parameters, which is a major limitation for vision applications. This paper addresses the scalability issue of large SSMs for image classification and action recognition without requiring additional techniques like knowledge distillation. We analyze the distinct characteristics of Mamba-based and Attention-based models, proposing a Mamba-Attention interleaved architecture that enhances scalability, robustness, and performance. We demonstrate that the stable and efficient interleaved architecture resolves the scalability issue of Mamba-based architectures for images and videos and increases robustness to common artifacts like JPEG compression. Our thorough evaluation on the ImageNet-1K, Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2 benchmarks demonstrates that our approach improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art Mamba-based architectures by up to $+1.7$.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Quantifying and Learning Static vs. Dynamic Information in Deep Spatiotemporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01783v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is limited understanding of the information captured by deep spatiotemporal models in their intermediate representations. For example, while evidence suggests that action recognition algorithms are heavily influenced by visual appearance in single frames, no quantitative methodology exists for evaluating such static bias in the latent representation compared to bias toward dynamics. We tackle this challenge by proposing an approach for quantifying the static and dynamic biases of any spatiotemporal model, and apply our approach to three tasks, action recognition, automatic video object segmentation (AVOS) and video instance segmentation (VIS). Our key findings are: (i) Most examined models are biased toward static information. (ii) Some datasets that are assumed to be biased toward dynamics are actually biased toward static information. (iii) Individual channels in an architecture can be biased toward static, dynamic or a combination of the two. (iv) Most models converge to their culminating biases in the first half of training. We then explore how these biases affect performance on dynamically biased datasets. For action recognition, we propose StaticDropout, a semantically guided dropout that debiases a model from static information toward dynamics. For AVOS, we design a better combination of fusion and cross connection layers compared with previous architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>TPAMI...</summary><p>TPAMI 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2206.02846</p></details> | None |

However, the former one-hot classification requires labor-intensive predefined action categories annotations, while the latter involves skeleton transformations (e.g., cropping) in the pretext tasks that may impair the skeleton structure. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel skeleton-based training framework (C$^2$VL) based on Cross-modal Contrastive learning that uses the progressive distillation to learn task-agnostic human skeleton action representation from the Vision-Language knowledge prompts. Specifically, we establish the vision-language action concept space through vision-language knowledge prompts generated by pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs), which enrich the fine-grained details that the skeleton action space lacks. Moreover, we propose the intra-modal self-similarity and inter-modal cross-consistency softened targets in the cross-modal representation learning process to progressively control and guide the degree of pulling vision-language knowledge prompts and corresponding skeletons closer. These soft instance discrimination and self-knowledge distillation strategies contribute to the learning of better skeleton-based action representations from the noisy skeleton-vision-language pairs. During the inference phase, our method requires only the skeleton data as the input for action recognition and no longer for vision-language prompts. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.

However, existing point cloud sequence modeling methods cannot adequately balance the precision of limb micro-movements with the integrity of posture macro-structure, leading to the loss of crucial information cues in action inference. To overcome this limitation, we introduce D-Hyperpoint, a novel data type generated through a D-Hyperpoint Embedding module. D-Hyperpoint encapsulates both regional-momentary motion and global-static posture, effectively summarizing the unit human action at each moment. In addition, we present a D-Hyperpoint KANsMixer module, which is recursively applied to nested groupings of D-Hyperpoints to learn the action discrimination information and creatively integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to enhance spatio-temporal interaction within D-Hyperpoints. Finally, we propose KAN-HyperpointNet, a spatio-temporal decoupled network architecture for 3D action recognition.

However, third-person view HOI has received less attention, especially in terms of datasets. Most third-person view datasets are curated for action recognition tasks and feature pre-segmented clips of high-level daily activities, leaving a gap for in-the-wild datasets. To address this gap, we propose ChildPlay-Hand, a novel dataset that includes person and object bounding boxes, as well as manipulation actions. ChildPlay-Hand is unique in: (1) providing per-hand annotations; (2) featuring videos in uncontrolled settings with natural interactions, involving both adults and children; (3) including gaze labels from the ChildPlay-Gaze dataset for joint modeling of manipulations and gaze. The manipulation actions cover the main stages of an HOI cycle, such as grasping, holding or operating, and different types of releasing. To illustrate the interest of the dataset, we study two tasks: object in hand detection (OiH), i.e. if a person has an object in their hand, and manipulation stages (ManiS), which is more fine-grained and targets the main stages of manipulation. We benchmark various spatio-temporal and segmentation networks, exploring body vs. hand-region information and comparing pose and RGB modalities. Our findings suggest that ChildPlay-Hand is a challenging new benchmark for modeling HOI in the wild.</p></details> |  | None |

The robustness of these techniques, however, remains a concern, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks that have been proven to deceive state-of-the-art deep neural networks in many domains. Surprisingly, the robustness of scene flow networks against such attacks has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this problem, the proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing adversarial white-box attacks specifically tailored for scene flow networks. Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples obtain up to 33.7 relative degradation in average end-point error on the KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets. The study also reveals the significant impact that attacks targeting point clouds in only one dimension or color channel have on average end-point error. Analyzing the success and failure of these attacks on the scene flow networks and their 2D optical flow network variants shows a higher vulnerability for the optical flow networks.

Synthesizing data is one of the promising ways to solve these issues, yet pre-training solely on synthetic data has its own challenges. In this paper, we introduce an effective self-supervised learning framework for videos that leverages readily available and less costly static images. Specifically, we define the Pseudo Motion Generator (PMG) module that recursively applies image transformations to generate pseudo-motion videos from images. These pseudo-motion videos are then leveraged in masked video modeling. Our approach is applicable to synthetic images as well, thus entirely freeing video pre-training from data collection costs and other concerns in real data. Through experiments in action recognition tasks, we demonstrate that this framework allows effective learning of spatio-temporal features through pseudo-motion videos, significantly improving over existing methods which also use static images and partially outperforming those using both real and synthetic videos. These results uncover fragments of what video transformers learn through masked video modeling.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 | None |

Therefore, unsupervised representation learning is of prime importance to leverage unlabeled skeleton data. In this work, we investigate unsupervised representation learning for skeleton action recognition. For this purpose, we designed a lightweight convolutional transformer framework, named ReL-SAR, exploiting the complementarity of convolutional and attention layers for jointly modeling spatial and temporal cues in skeleton sequences. We also use a Selection-Permutation strategy for skeleton joints to ensure more informative descriptions from skeletal data. Finally, we capitalize on Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) to learn robust representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data.

| **[Unfolding Videos Dynamics via Taylor Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02371v2)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taking inspiration from physical motion, we present a new self-supervised dynamics learning strategy for videos: Video Time-Differentiation for Instance Discrimination (ViDiDi). ViDiDi is a simple and data-efficient strategy, readily applicable to existing self-supervised video representation learning frameworks based on instance discrimination. At its core, ViDiDi observes different aspects of a video through various orders of temporal derivatives of its frame sequence. These derivatives, along with the original frames, support the Taylor series expansion of the underlying continuous dynamics at discrete times, where higher-order derivatives emphasize higher-order motion features. ViDiDi learns a single neural network that encodes a video and its temporal derivatives into consistent embeddings following a balanced alternating learning algorithm. By learning consistent representations for original frames and derivatives, the encoder is steered to emphasize motion features over static backgrounds and uncover the hidden dynamics in original frames. Hence, video representations are better separated by dynamic features. We integrate ViDiDi into existing instance discrimination frameworks (VICReg, BYOL, and SimCLR) for pretraining on UCF101 or Kinetics and test on standard benchmarks including video retrieval, action recognition, and action detection. The performances are enhanced by a significant margin without the need for large models or extensive datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
