| **[Anomaly Detection in Networked Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20076v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nodes' interconnections on a social network often reflect their dependencies and information-sharing behaviors. Nevertheless, abnormal nodes, which significantly deviate from most of the network concerning patterns or behaviors, can lead to grave consequences. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient online learning algorithms that robustly learn users' preferences while simultaneously detecting anomalies. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm to address this problem. Through network knowledge, the method characterizes the users' preferences and residuals of feature information. By learning and analyzing these preferences and residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each user and simultaneously detects anomalies. We rigorously prove an upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm and experimentally compare it with several state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Synthetic Image Detection via Spectral Gaps of QC-RBIM Nishimori Bethe-Hessian Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19698v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advance of deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion networks now produces images that are virtually indistinguishable from genuine photographs, undermining media forensics and biometric security. Supervised detectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial post-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level statistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired, model-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a community-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are first extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature vector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities are transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature, producing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum exhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is present. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack such gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male versus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic counterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled synthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves over 94% accuracy. Spectral analysis shows multiple well separated gaps for real image sets and a collapsed spectrum for generated ones. Our contributions are threefold: a novel LDPC graph construction that embeds deep image features, an analytical link between Nishimori temperature RBIM and the Bethe-Hessian spectrum providing a Bayes optimal detection criterion; and a practical, unsupervised synthetic image detector robust to new generative architectures. Future work will extend the framework to video streams and multi-class anomaly detection.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Topological Uncertainty for Anomaly Detection in the Neural-network EoS Inference with Neutron Star Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19683v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the performance of the Topological Uncertainty (TU) constructed with a trained feedforward neural network (FNN) for Anomaly Detection. Generally, meaningful information can be stored in the hidden layers of the trained FNN, and the TU implementation is one tractable recipe to extract buried information by means of the Topological Data Analysis. We explicate the concept of the TU and the numerical procedures. Then, for a concrete demonstration of the performance test, we employ the Neutron Star data used for inference of the equation of state (EoS). For the training dataset consisting of the input (Neutron Star data) and the output (EoS parameters), we can compare the inferred EoSs and the exact answers to classify the data with the label $k$. The subdataset with $k=0$ leads to the normal inference for which the inferred EoS approximates the answer well, while the subdataset with $k=1$ ends up with the unsuccessful inference. Once the TU is prepared based on the $k$-labled subdatasets, we introduce the cross-TU to quantify the uncertainty of characterizing the $k$-labeled data with the label $j$. The anomaly or unsuccessful inference is correctly detected if the cross-TU for $j=k=1$ is smaller than that for $j=0$ and $k=1$. In our numerical experiment, for various input data, we calculate the cross-TU and estimate the performance of Anomaly Detection. We find that performance depends on FNN hyperparameters, and the success rate of Anomaly Detection exceeds $90\%$ in the best case. We finally discuss further potential of the TU application to retrieve the information hidden in the trained FNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[DNP-Guided Contrastive Reconstruction with a Reverse Distillation Transformer for Medical Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19573v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in medical images is challenging due to limited annotations and a domain gap compared to natural images. Existing reconstruction methods often rely on frozen pre-trained encoders, which limits adaptation to domain-specific features and reduces localization accuracy. Prototype-based learning offers interpretability and clustering benefits but suffers from prototype collapse, where few prototypes dominate training, harming diversity and generalization. To address this, we propose a unified framework combining a trainable encoder with prototype-guided reconstruction and a novel Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss. The trainable encoder, enhanced by a momentum branch, enables stable domain-adaptive feature learning. A lightweight Prototype Extractor mines informative normal prototypes to guide the decoder via attention for precise reconstruction. Our loss enforces balanced prototype use through diversity constraints and per-prototype normalization, effectively preventing collapse. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show significant improvements in representation quality and anomaly localization, outperforming prior methods. Visualizations and prototype assignment analyses further validate the effectiveness of our anti-collapse mechanism and enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |

Although widely adopted for convenience, traditional authentication mechanisms like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) rely on static identifiers and weak encryption, making them highly vulnerable to attack vectors such as cloning, relay attacks, and signal interception. This study explores an AI-powered adaptive authentication framework designed to overcome these shortcomings by integrating machine learning, anomaly detection, behavioral analytics, and contextual risk assessment. Grounded in the principles of Zero Trust Architecture, the proposed framework emphasizes continuous verification, least privilege access, and secure communication. Through a comprehensive literature review, this research evaluates current vulnerabilities and highlights AI-driven solutions to provide a scalable, resilient, and proactive defense. Ultimately, the research findings conclude that adopting AI-powered adaptive authentication is a strategic imperative for securing the future of electric mobility and strengthening digital trust across the ecosystem.

| **[CITADEL: Continual Anomaly Detection for Enhanced Learning in IoT Intrusion Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19450v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet of Things (IoT), with its high degree of interconnectivity and limited computational resources, is particularly vulnerable to a wide range of cyber threats. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been extensively studied to enhance IoT security, and machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) show considerable promise for detecting malicious activity. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by poor adaptability to emerging threats and the issue of catastrophic forgetting during continuous learning. To address these challenges, we propose CITADEL, a self-supervised continual learning framework designed to extract robust representations from benign data while preserving long-term knowledge through optimized memory consolidation mechanisms. CITADEL integrates a tabular-to-image transformation module, a memory-aware masked autoencoder for self-supervised representation learning, and a novelty detection component capable of identifying anomalies without dependence on labeled attack data. Our design enables the system to incrementally adapt to emerging behaviors while retaining its ability to detect previously observed threats. Experiments on multiple intrusion datasets demonstrate that CITADEL achieves up to a 72.9% improvement over the VAE-based lifelong anomaly detector (VLAD) in key detection and retention metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in dynamic IoT environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE IoTJ</p></details> | None |
| **[Metric Matters: A Formal Evaluation of Similarity Measures in Active Learning for Cyber Threat Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19019v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets, including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for threat intelligence and cyber defense.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we developed and named HOTSPOT-YOLO, a lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) model that integrates an efficient convolutional neural network backbone and attention mechanisms to improve object detection. This model is specifically designed for drone-based thermal inspections of PV systems, addressing the unique challenges of detecting small and subtle thermal anomalies, such as hotspots and defective modules, while maintaining real-time performance. Experimental results demonstrate a mean average precision of 90.8%, reflecting a significant improvement over baseline object detection models. With a reduced computational load and robustness under diverse environmental conditions, HOTSPOT-YOLO offers a scalable and reliable solution for large-scale PV inspections. This work highlights the integration of advanced AI techniques with practical engineering applications, revolutionizing automated fault detection in renewable energy systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Closer Look at Edema Area Segmentation in SD-OCT Images Using Adversarial Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18790v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME) analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA) strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18758v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying. We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases, allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences, addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model. We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DRTA: Dynamic Reward Scaling for Reinforcement Learning in Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18474v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates, and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning, called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Context-Aware Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Using Contrastive and Predictive Spatiotemporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18463v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance.

This is especially evident in US and Canada, where cyber-enabled auto theft has surged in recent years, revealing the limitations of existing security measures for connected vehicles. In response, this paper proposes $AutoGuardX$, a comprehensive cybersecurity framework designed specifically for connected vehicles. $AutoGuardX$ combines key elements from existing recognized standards for vehicle security, such as ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO 26262, with advanced technologies, including machine learning-based anomaly detection, IoT security protocols, and encrypted communication channels. The framework addresses major attack vectors like relay attacks, controller area network (CAN) bus intrusions, and vulnerabilities introduced by emerging technologies such as 5G and quantum computing. $AutoGuardX$ is extensively evaluated through security simulations across a mix of Sedans and SUVs from four major vehicle brands manufactured between 2019 and 2023. The results demonstrate the framework's adaptability, scalability, and practical effectiveness against existing and emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Fault Detection in New Wind Turbines with Limited Data by Generative Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17709v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep transfer learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to a new one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault detection in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault detection in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Change of phrasing to fault detection, including title change, and minor revisions.

| **[Evasive Active Hypothesis Testing with Deep Neuroevolution: The Single- and Multi-Agent Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10112v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active hypothesis testing is a thoroughly studied problem that finds numerous applications in wireless communications and sensor networks. In this paper, we focus on one centralized and one decentralized problem of active hypothesis testing in the presence of an eavesdropper. For the centralized problem including a single legitimate agent, we present a new framework based on deep NeuroEvolution (NE), whereas, for the decentralized problem, we develop a novel NE-based method for solving collaborative multi-agent tasks, which, interestingly, maintains all computational benefits of our single-agent NE-based scheme. To further reduce the computational complexity of the latter scheme, a novel multi-agent joint NE and pruning framework is also designed. The superiority of the proposed NE-based evasive active hypothesis testing schemes over conventional active hypothesis testing policies, as well as learning-based methods, is validated through extensive numerical investigations in an example use case of anomaly detection over wireless sensor networks. It is demonstrated that the proposed joint optimization and pruning framework achieves nearly identical performance with its unpruned counterpart, while removing a very large percentage of redundant deep neural network weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at an IEEE journal, shorter conference version presented at IEEE ICC 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Continual Visual Anomaly Detection in the Medical Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18013v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention, even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data, Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fence off Anomaly Interference: Cross-Domain Distillation for Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18007v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD) framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm. Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD setting.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we propose CoZAD, a novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VISION Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and 92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect data curation is challenging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VISION Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods typically follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings, regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.</p></details> |  | None |

Combining both, we create a reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging, large-scale pointclouds.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv Preprint, paper has since been accepted to ACPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Unlike traditional Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which aim to exhaust resources and disrupt service availability, DoW attacks focus on escalating costs without impacting service operation. This review traces the evolution of DoW research, from initial awareness and attack classification to advancements in detection and mitigation strategies. Key developments include the categorisation of attack types-such as Blast DDoW, Continual Inconspicuous DDoW, and Background Chained DDoW-and the creation of simulation tools like DoWTS, which enable safe experimentation and data generation. Recent advancements highlight machine learning approaches, including systems like Gringotts and DoWNet, which leverage deep learning and anomaly detection to identify malicious traffic patterns. Although substantial progress has been made, challenges persist, notably the lack of real-world data and the need for adaptive billing models. This is the first comprehensive literature review dedicated strictly to Denial of Wallet attacks, providing an in-depth analysis of their financial impacts, attack techniques, mitigation strategies, and detection mechanisms within serverless computing. The paper also presents the first detailed examination of simulation and data generation tools used for DoW research, addressing a critical gap in existing cybersecurity literature. By synthesising these key areas, this study serves as a foundational resource for future research and industry efforts in securing pay-as-you-go cloud environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Our approach integrates a delay-aware neural architecture, a numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse sequences.

| **[Mutual Information Surprise: Rethinking Unexpectedness in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17403v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking. Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-S...</summary><p>Pre-Submission Version</p></details> | None |
| **[A Decoupled LOB Representation Framework for Multilevel Manipulation Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17086v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets are critical to global economic stability, yet trade-based manipulation (TBM) often undermines their fairness. Spoofing, a particularly deceptive TBM strategy, exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns that have not been adequately modeled. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation pipeline with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel anomalies and the contributions of key components, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex sequential data. Our code will be released later at this URL.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Photorealistic Dataset and Vision-Based Algorithm for Anomaly Detection During Proximity Operations in Lunar Orbit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20435v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NASA's forthcoming Lunar Gateway space station, which will be uncrewed most of the time, will need to operate with an unprecedented level of autonomy. One key challenge is enabling the Canadarm3, the Gateway's external robotic system, to detect hazards in its environment using its onboard inspection cameras. This task is complicated by the extreme and variable lighting conditions in space. In this paper, we introduce the visual anomaly detection and localization task for the space domain and establish a benchmark based on a synthetic dataset called ALLO (Anomaly Localization in Lunar Orbit). We show that state-of-the-art visual anomaly detection methods often fail in the space domain, motivating the need for new approaches. To address this, we propose MRAD (Model Reference Anomaly Detection), a statistical algorithm that leverages the known pose of the Canadarm3 and a CAD model of the Gateway to generate reference images of the expected scene appearance. Anomalies are then identified as deviations from this model-generated reference. On the ALLO dataset, MRAD surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms, achieving an AP score of 62.1% at the pixel level and an AUROC score of 74.9% at the image level. Given the low tolerance for risk in space operations and the lack of domain-specific data, we emphasize the need for novel, robust, and accurate anomaly detection methods to handle the challenging visual conditions found in lunar orbit and beyond.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

Typically, automata learning techniques operate in a supervised learning setting (active or passive) where they learn a finite state machine in contexts where additional information, such as labeled system executions, is available. However, other settings, such as learning from unlabeled data - an important aspect in machine learning - remain unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a given multi-set of unlabeled words. We show that this problem is computationally hard and develop three learning algorithms based on constraint optimization. Moreover, we introduce novel regularization schemes for our optimization problems that improve the overall interpretability of our DFAs. Using a prototype implementation, we demonstrate practical feasibility in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Such semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e., reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICPM 2025, 8 pages, 2 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Beyond Human-prompting: Adaptive Prompt Tuning with Semantic Alignment for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16157v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding. In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

PaDiM, a prominent method, models the distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework. This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32% Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH) often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures | None |

In these applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However, they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters, thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper accepted for publication at the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies, resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias, EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends, effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and temporal biases.</p></details> |  | None |

While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process, facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

CPS combines sensing and computing elements, often having multi-layer designs with networking, computational, and physical interfaces, which provide them with enhanced capabilities for a variety of application scenarios. However, the combination of physical and computational elements also makes CPS more vulnerable to attacks compared to network-only systems, and the resulting impacts of CPS attacks can be substantial. Intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS) are an effective mechanism by which CPS can be secured, but the majority of current solutions often train and validate on network traffic-only datasets, ignoring the distinct attacks that may occur on other system layers. In order to address this, we develop an adaptable CPS anomaly detection model that can detect attacks within CPS without the need for previously labeled data. To achieve this, we utilize domain adaptation techniques that allow us to transfer known attack knowledge from a network traffic-only environment to a CPS environment. We validate our approach using a state-of-the-art CPS intrusion dataset that combines network, operating system (OS), and Robot Operating System (ROS) data. Through this dataset, we are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across network traffic-only and CPS environments with distinct attack types and its ability to outperform other anomaly detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in MILCOM 2025. 6 pages, 2 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Evolving Network Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15100v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time, poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems. Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts. Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to 11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that experience distribution shifts over time.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.</p></details> |  | None |

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors.

Due to the limited size of a video capsule, embedding AI models directly into the capsule demands careful consideration of the model size and thus complicates anomaly detection in this field. Furthermore, the scarcity of available data in this domain poses an ongoing challenge to achieving effective anomaly detection. Thus, this work introduces an ensemble strategy to address this challenge in anomaly detection tasks in video capsule endoscopies, requiring only a small number of individual neural networks during both the training and inference phases. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple independently trained neural networks. This has shown to be highly effective in enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models. However, this comes at the cost of higher memory usage and increased computational effort, which quickly becomes prohibitive in many real-world applications. Instead of applying the same training algorithm to each individual network, we propose using various loss functions, drawn from the anomaly detection field, to train each network. The methods are validated on the two largest publicly available datasets for video capsule endoscopy images, the Galar and the Kvasir-Capsule dataset. We achieve an AUC score of 76.86% on the Kvasir-Capsule and an AUC score of 76.98% on the Galar dataset. Our approach outperforms current baselines with significantly fewer parameters across all models, which is a crucial step towards incorporating artificial intelligence into capsule endoscopies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS EMBC)</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose a novel foundation model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity.

Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently, various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2024 KDD Workshop</p></details> | None |

The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05662v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success, recent reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) methods via diffusion modeling still involve fine-grained noise-strength tuning and computationally expensive multi-step denoising, leading to a fundamental tension between fidelity and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel inversion-based AD approach - detection via noising in latent space - which circumvents explicit reconstruction. Importantly, we contend that the limitations in prior reconstruction-based methods originate from the prevailing detection via denoising in RGB space paradigm. To address this, we model AD under a reconstruction-free formulation, which directly infers the final latent variable corresponding to the input image via DDIM inversion, and then measures the deviation based on the known prior distribution for anomaly scoring. Specifically, in approximating the original probability flow ODE using the Euler method, we only enforce very few inversion steps to noise the clean image to pursue inference efficiency. As the added noise is adaptively derived with the learned diffusion model, the original features for the clean testing image can still be leveraged to yield high detection accuracy. We perform extensive experiments and detailed analysis across three widely used image AD datasets under the unsupervised unified setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, regarding state-of-the-art AD performance, and about 2 times inference time speedup without diffusion distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/SkyShunsuke/InversionAD</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SkyShunsuke/InversionAD) |

This paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions. Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance, particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely through semantic instructions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Artificial Intelligence-Based Multiscale Temporal Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14503v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comprehensive Library for Benchmarking Multi-class Visual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03262v6)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous regions in images through unsupervised learning paradigms, with increasing application demand and value in fields such as industrial inspection and medical lesion detection. Despite significant progress in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to adequately evaluate the performance of various mainstream methods across different datasets under the practical multi-class setting. The absence of standardized experimental setups can lead to potential biases in training epochs, resolution, and metric results, resulting in erroneous conclusions. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a comprehensive visual anomaly detection benchmark, ADer, which is a modular framework that is highly extensible for new methods. The benchmark includes multiple datasets from industrial and medical domains, implementing fifteen state-of-the-art methods and nine comprehensive metrics. Additionally, we have proposed the GPU-assisted ADEval package to address the slow evaluation problem of metrics like time-consuming mAU-PRO on large-scale data, significantly reducing evaluation time by more than 1000-fold. Through extensive experimental results, we objectively reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and provide insights into the challenges and future directions of multi-class visual anomaly detection. We hope that ADer will become a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, promoting the development of more robust and generalizable anomaly detection systems.

Current research of a dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method \cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space, in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components. Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.</p></details> | 14 pages 5 figures | None |
| **[Stereo-based 3D Anomaly Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A New Dataset and Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09214v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving, with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road, 3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm, which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue. Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be obtained at https://github.com/shiyi-mu/S3AD-Code).</p></details> | under review | [Code Link](https://github.com/shiyi-mu/S3AD-Code) |

Despite these advantages, their predictions still suffer from variance, domain-specific bias, and limited uncertainty quantification when deployed on real operational data. This paper investigates a suite of statistical and ensemble-based enhancement techniques, including bootstrap-based bagging, regression-based stacking, prediction interval construction, statistical residual modeling, and iterative error feedback, to improve robustness and accuracy. Using the Belgium Electricity Short-Term Load Forecasting dataset as a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrids consistently outperform standalone foundation models across multiple horizons. Regression-based ensembles achieve the lowest mean squared error; bootstrap aggregation markedly reduces long-context errors; residual modeling corrects systematic bias; and the resulting prediction intervals achieve near nominal coverage with widths shrinking as context length increases. The results indicate that integrating statistical reasoning with modern foundation models yields measurable gains in accuracy, reliability, and interpretability for real-world time series applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection Pipeline for SOZ Localization Using Ictal-Related Chirp](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13406v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1) Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1) were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization, particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures | None |

| **[Towards High-Resolution Industrial Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12931v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current anomaly detection methods primarily focus on low-resolution scenarios. For high-resolution images, conventional downsampling often results in missed detections of subtle anomalous regions due to the loss of fine-grained discriminative information. Despite some progress, recent studies have attempted to improve detection resolution by employing lightweight networks or using simple image tiling and ensemble methods. However, these approaches still struggle to meet the practical demands of industrial scenarios in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose HiAD, a general framework for high-resolution anomaly detection. HiAD is capable of detecting anomalous regions of varying sizes in high-resolution images under limited computational resources. Specifically, HiAD employs a dual-branch architecture that integrates anomaly cues across different scales to comprehensively capture both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Furthermore, it incorporates a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to tackle the challenges posed by fine-grained texture variations in high-resolution images. To enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in conjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to be adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance while effectively controlling computational costs. We conduct extensive experiments on our specifically constructed high-resolution anomaly detection benchmarks, including MVTec-HD, VisA-HD, and the real-world benchmark RealIAD-HD, demonstrating the superior performance of HiAD.

It has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on industrial images.

While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space, generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2) Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing).

One challenge is the real-time characterization of false data injections, which can mask sensor signals and potentially disrupt reactor control systems. While significant progress has been made in anomaly detection within reactor systems, potential false data injections have been shown to bypass conventional linear time-invariant state estimators and failure detectors based on statistical thresholds. The dynamic, nonlinear, multi-variate nature of sensor signals, combined with inherent noise and limited availability of real-world training data, makes the characterization of such threats and more importantly their differentiation from anticipated process anomalies particularly challenging. In this paper, we present an eXplainable AI (XAI) framework for identifying non-stationary concurrent replay attacks in nuclear reactor signals with minimal training data. The proposed framework leverages progress on recurrent neural networks and residual analysis coupled with a modified SHAP algorithm and rule-based correlations. The recurrent neural networks are trained only on normal operational data while for residual analysis we introduce an adaptive windowing technique to improve detection accuracy. We successfully benchmarked this framework on a real-world dataset from Purdue's nuclear reactor (PUR-1). We were able to detect false data injections with accuracy higher than 0.93 and less than 0.01 false positives, differentiate from expected process anomalies, and to identify the origin of the falsified signals.</p></details> |  | None |

However, such systems introduce unique challenges in monitoring, interpreting, and detecting system failures. Most existing MAS observability frameworks focus on analyzing each individual agent separately, overlooking failures associated with the entire MAS. To bridge this gap, we propose LumiMAS, a novel MAS observability framework that incorporates advanced analytics and monitoring techniques. The proposed framework consists of three key components: a monitoring and logging layer, anomaly detection layer, and anomaly explanation layer. LumiMAS's first layer monitors MAS executions, creating detailed logs of the agents' activity. These logs serve as input to the anomaly detection layer, which detects anomalies across the MAS workflow in real time. Then, the anomaly explanation layer performs classification and root cause analysis (RCA) of the detected anomalies. LumiMAS was evaluated on seven different MAS applications, implemented using two popular MAS platforms, and a diverse set of possible failures. The applications include two novel failure-tailored applications that illustrate the effects of a hallucination or bias on the MAS. The evaluation results demonstrate LumiMAS's effectiveness in failure detection, classification, and RCA.</p></details> |  | None |

However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> | None |

While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method in anomaly detection, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest F1-score in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, with an F1-score scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 \textmu J during inference.

While conventional graph shift operators (GSOs) are effective for certain tasks, they inherently lack flexibility in modeling dependencies between non-adjacent nodes, limiting their ability to represent complex graph structures. To address this limitation, this paper proposes the unified extended matrix (UEM) framework, which integrates the extended-adjacency matrix and the unified graph representation matrix through parametric design, so as to be able to flexibly adapt to different graph structures and reveal more graph signal information. Theoretical analysis of the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we propose graph Fourier transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT), which can adaptively tune spectral properties to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based methods in anomaly detection tasks, achieving superior performance across varying network topologies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-awareness Unknown Region for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19183v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of transformer-based architectures and large language models (LLMs), the accuracy of road scene perception has substantially advanced. Nonetheless, current road scene segmentation approaches are predominantly trained on closed-set data, resulting in insufficient detection capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. To overcome this limitation, road anomaly detection methods have been proposed. However, existing methods primarily depend on image inpainting and OOD distribution detection techniques, facing two critical issues: (1) inadequate consideration of the objectiveness attributes of anomalous regions, causing incomplete segmentation when anomalous objects share similarities with known classes, and (2) insufficient attention to environmental constraints, leading to the detection of anomalies irrelevant to autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-Awareness (SOTA) for autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, SOTA enhances the segmentation of objectiveness through a Semantic Fusion Block (SFB) and filters anomalies irrelevant to road navigation tasks using a Scene-understanding Guided Prompt-Context Adaptor (SG-PCA). Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fishyscapes Lost and Found, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly, demonstrate that the proposed SOTA consistently improves OOD detection performance across diverse detectors, achieving robust and accurate segmentation outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite rapid advancements in visual anomaly detection (VAD), interpreting these often black-box models and explaining why specific instances are flagged as anomalous remains challenging. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey focused specifically on explainable 2D visual anomaly detection (X-VAD), covering methods for both images (IAD) and videos (VAD). We first introduce the background of IAD and VAD. Then, as the core contribution, we present a thorough literature review of explainable methods, categorized by their underlying techniques (e.g., attention-based, generative model-based, reasoning-based, foundation model-based). We analyze the commonalities and differences in applying these methods across image and video modalities, highlighting modality-specific challenges and opportunities for explainability. Additionally, we summarize relevant datasets and evaluation metrics, discussing both standard performance metrics and emerging approaches for assessing explanation quality (e.g., faithfulness, stability). Finally, we discuss promising future directions and open problems, including quantifying explanation quality, explaining diverse AD paradigms (SSL, zero-shot), enhancing context-awareness, leveraging foundation models responsibly, and addressing real-world constraints like efficiency and robustness.

Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805 without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches. With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to 0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.</p></details> |  | None |

This capability is demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology and artificial intelligence in Africa.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Training-Free Anomaly Generation via Dual-Attention Enhancement in Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11550v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However, these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement (CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11528v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting, imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world dataset while remaining competitive on others.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[AFR-CLIP: Enhancing Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection with Stateless-to-Stateful Anomaly Feature Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12910v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for industrial inspection and medical diagnostics, detecting defects in novel objects without requiring any target-dataset samples during training. Existing CLIP-based ZSAD methods generate anomaly maps by measuring the cosine similarity between visual and textual features. However, CLIP's alignment with object categories instead of their anomalous states limits its effectiveness for anomaly detection. To address this limitation, we propose AFR-CLIP, a CLIP-based anomaly feature rectification framework. AFR-CLIP first performs image-guided textual rectification, embedding the implicit defect information from the image into a stateless prompt that describes the object category without indicating any anomalous state. The enriched textual embeddings are then compared with two pre-defined stateful (normal or abnormal) embeddings, and their text-on-text similarity yields the anomaly map that highlights defective regions. To further enhance perception to multi-scale features and complex anomalies, we introduce self prompting (SP) and multi-patch feature aggregation (MPFA) modules. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven anomaly detection benchmarks across industrial and medical domains, demonstrating AFR-CLIP's superiority in ZSAD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Logic Unseen: Revealing the Logical Blindspots of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11317v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical ''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications. To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance, particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality, highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM logical capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Dual-Branch Prompt Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00777v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods, whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2) a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data. Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2025</p></details> | None |

With the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements. However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed, GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection. To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose \textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods.

Recently, some FS-IAD methods based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across 400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in camera-ready.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MirGuard: Towards a Robust Provenance-based Intrusion Detection System Against Graph Manipulation Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10639v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have become essential tools for anomaly detection in host systems due to their ability to capture rich contextual and structural information, as well as their potential to detect unknown attacks. However, recent studies have shown that these systems are vulnerable to graph manipulation attacks, where attackers manipulate the graph structure to evade detection. While some previous approaches have discussed this type of attack, none have fully addressed it with a robust detection solution, limiting the practical applicability of PIDSes. To address this challenge, we propose MirGuard, a robust anomaly detection framework that combines logic-aware multi-view augmentation with contrastive representation learning. Rather than applying arbitrary structural perturbations, MirGuard introduces Logic-Aware Noise Injection (LNI) to generate semantically valid graph views, ensuring that all augmentations preserve the underlying causal semantics of the provenance data. These views are then used in a Logic-Preserving Contrastive Learning framework, which encourages the model to learn representations that are invariant to benign transformations but sensitive to adversarial inconsistencies. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple provenance datasets demonstrate that MirGuard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in robustness against various graph manipulation attacks without sacrificing detection performance and efficiency. Our work represents the first targeted study to enhance PIDS against such adversarial threats, providing a robust and effective solution to modern cybersecurity challenges.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the current advancements in deep learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically, it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any training or iterative optimization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Anomaly Detection for Multi-Tenant Cloud Platforms with Personalized Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10255v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud computing environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoBAD: Modeling Collective Behaviors for Human Mobility Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14088v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge. Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences (CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Building on its original formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems. Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

This paper presents a comprehensive study that addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate $ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence. This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving their existence becomes infeasible.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures | None |

In this complex ecosystem, where the end-to-end communication path traverses multiple entities, it has become increasingly challenging to guarantee communication availability and reliability. Further, most platform operators use a reactive approach to communication issues, responding to user complaints only after incidents have become severe, compromising service quality. This paper presents our experience in the design and deployment of ANCHOR -- an unsupervised anomaly detection solution for the IoT connectivity service of a large global roaming platform. ANCHOR assists engineers by filtering vast amounts of data to identify potential problematic clients (i.e., those with connectivity issues affecting several of their IoT devices), enabling proactive issue resolution before the service is critically impacted. We first describe the IoT service, infrastructure, and network visibility of the IoT connectivity provider we operate. Second, we describe the main challenges and operational requirements for designing an unsupervised anomaly detection solution on this platform. Following these guidelines, we propose different statistical rules, and machine- and deep-learning models for IoT verticals anomaly detection based on passive signaling traffic. We describe the steps we followed working with the operational teams on the design and evaluation of our solution on the operational platform, and report an evaluation on operational IoT customers.</p></details> |  | None |

To simplify log analysis, template generation methods have been proposed to standardize log formats, transforming unstructured data into structured templates. Existing heuristic-based methods and neural network-based methods suffer from low accuracy problems due to the reliance on handcrafted heuristics or specific log patterns in training sets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in log template generation. However, they often struggle with ambiguous, complex, or highly specific log content, which can lead to errors in generating accurate templates. To address these challenges, we propose LLMLog, a multi-round annotation framework with adaptive in-context learning. We first propose an edit-distance-based similarity metric to evaluate log similarity. Then, we introduce a method to select the most informative $k$ unlabeled logs for annotation by considering both the representativeness of the logs and the confidence of LLM predictions. Additionally, we design an adaptive context selection strategy that adaptively selects labeled logs to ensure comprehensive keyword coverage for unlabeled logs. These labeled logs serve as the context for LLMs to better understand the unlabeled logs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of template generation. Extensive experiments on sixteen datasets demonstrate that LLMLog outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in VLDB 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods -- statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal" and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 5 figures, Submission for ACM TKDD</p></details> | None |

Most AII detectors often employ the conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs (generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images, optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by various image generators.</p></details> |  | None |

Effectively utilizing all views in G is essential for MVAG clustering and embedding, which are important for applications like recommendation systems, anomaly detection, social network analysis, etc. Existing methods either achieve inferior result quality or incur significant computational costs to handle large-scale MVAGs. In this paper, we present a spectrum-guided Laplacian aggregation scheme with an effective objective formulation and two efficient algorithms SGLA and SGLA+, to cohesively integrate all views of G into an MVAG Laplacian matrix, which readily enables classic graph algorithms to handle G with superior performance in clustering and embedding tasks. We begin by conducting a theoretical analysis to design an integrated objective that consists of two components, the eigengap and connectivity objectives, aiming to link the spectral properties of the aggregated MVAG Laplacian with the underlying community and connectivity properties of G. A constrained optimization problem is then formulated for the integration, which is computationally expensive to solve. Thus, we first develop the SGLA algorithm, which already achieves excellent performance compared with existing methods. To further enhance efficiency, we design SGLA+ to reduce the number of costly objective evaluations via sampling and approximation to quickly find an approximate optimum. Extensive experiments compare our methods against 12 baselines for clustering and 8 baselines for embedding on 8 multi-view attributed graphs, validating the superior performance of SGLA and SGLA+ in terms of result quality and efficiency. Compared with the most effective baselines, our methods are significantly faster, often by up to orders of magnitude.</p></details> | 12 pages. ICDE 2025 | None |

A Transformer is used to model the temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores, enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics, demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential for practical deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

A comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then, generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios. Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios, while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.</p></details> | 36 pages, 10 figures | None |

In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose, evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service, and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and under review in IEEE Transactions on Privacy</p></details> | None |
| **[ALFred: An Active Learning Framework for Real-world Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adaptive Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09058v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments, ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Triad: Empowering LMM-based Anomaly Detection with Vision Expert-guided Visual Tokenizer and Manufacturing Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13184v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent methods have tried to introduce large multimodal models (LMMs) into industrial anomaly detection (IAD), their generalization in the IAD field is far inferior to that for general purposes. We summarize the main reasons for this gap into two aspects. On one hand, general-purpose LMMs lack cognition of defects in the visual modality, thereby failing to sufficiently focus on defect areas. Therefore, we propose to modify the AnyRes structure of the LLaVA model, providing the potential anomalous areas identified by existing IAD models to the LMMs. On the other hand, existing methods mainly focus on identifying defects by learning defect patterns or comparing with normal samples, yet they fall short of understanding the causes of these defects. Considering that the generation of defects is closely related to the manufacturing process, we propose a manufacturing-driven IAD paradigm. An instruction-tuning dataset for IAD (InstructIAD) and a data organization approach for Chain-of-Thought with manufacturing (CoT-M) are designed to leverage the manufacturing process for IAD. Based on the above two modifications, we present Triad, a novel LMM-based method incorporating an expert-guided region-of-interest tokenizer and manufacturing process for industrial anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show that our Triad not only demonstrates competitive performance against current LMMs but also achieves further improved accuracy when equipped with manufacturing processes. Source code, training data, and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/tzjtatata/Triad.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/tzjtatata/Triad) |

To mitigate these challenges, the implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough process of anomaly identification and detection in information and communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Momentum Point-Perplexity Mechanics in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08492v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We take a physics-based approach to studying how the internal hidden states of large language models change from token to token during inference. Across 20 open-source transformer models (135M-3B parameters), we find that a quantity combining the rate of change in hidden states and the model's next-token certainty, analogous to energy in physics, remains nearly constant. Random-weight models conserve this "energy" more tightly than pre-trained ones, while training shifts models into a faster, more decisive regime with greater variability. Using this "log-Lagrangian" view, we derive a control method called Jacobian steering, which perturbs hidden states in the minimal way needed to favor a target token. This approach maintained near-constant energy in two tested models and produced continuations rated higher in semantic quality than the models' natural outputs. Viewing transformers through this mechanics lens offers a principled basis for interpretability, anomaly detection, and low-risk steering. This could help make powerful models more predictable and aligned with human intent.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the high-stakes nature of biomedical imaging necessitates robust mechanisms to detect and manage unexpected or erroneous model behavior. We introduce development and implementation of a hybrid anomaly detection framework to safeguard GenAI models in BIOEMTECH's eyes(TM) systems. Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays from photographic mouse images, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD) enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory compliance.</p></details> |  | None |

We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 reference, 3 figures, icassp 2026</p></details> | None |
| **[UltraAD: Fine-Grained Ultrasound Anomaly Classification via Few-Shot CLIP Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19694v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors. Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Crane: Context-Guided Prompt Learning and Attention Refinement for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11055v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly Detection involves identifying deviations from normal data distributions and is critical in fields such as medical diagnostics and industrial defect detection. Traditional AD methods typically require the availability of normal training samples; however, this assumption is not always feasible. Recently, the rich pretraining knowledge of CLIP has shown promising zero-shot generalization in detecting anomalies without the need for training samples from target domains. However, CLIP's coarse-grained image-text alignment limits localization and detection performance for fine-grained anomalies due to: (1) spatial misalignment, and (2) the limited sensitivity of global features to local anomalous patterns. In this paper, we propose Crane which tackles both problems. First, we introduce a correlation-based attention module to retain spatial alignment more accurately. Second, to boost the model's awareness of fine-grained anomalies, we condition the learnable prompts of the text encoder on image context extracted from the vision encoder and perform a local-to-global representation fusion. Moreover, our method can incorporate vision foundation models such as DINOv2 to further enhance spatial understanding and localization. The key insight of Crane is to balance learnable adaptations for modeling anomalous concepts with non-learnable adaptations that preserve and exploit generalized pretrained knowledge, thereby minimizing in-domain overfitting and maximizing performance on unseen domains. Extensive evaluation across 14 diverse industrial and medical datasets demonstrates that Crane consistently improves the state-of-the-art ZSAD from 2% to 28%, at both image and pixel levels, while remaining competitive in inference speed.

However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Egocentric Object Detection in Static Environments using Graph-based Spatial Anomaly Detection and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07624v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However, state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work, we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%. This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we present a controlled comparison of four representative models - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best, demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios.

| **[Levarging Learning Bias for Noisy Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07441v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies. Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2) feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset. Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data.

Single-view tasks will encounter blind spots from other perspectives, resulting in inaccuracies in sample-level prediction. Therefore, we introduce the Multi-View Anomaly Detection (MVAD) approach, which learns and integrates features from multi-views. Specifically, we propose a Multi-View Adaptive Selection (MVAS) algorithm for feature learning and fusion across multiple views. The feature maps are divided into neighbourhood attention windows to calculate a semantic correlation matrix between single-view windows and all other views, which is an attention mechanism conducted for each single-view window and the top-k most correlated multi-view windows. Adjusting the window sizes and top-k can minimise the complexity to O((hw)^4/3). Extensive experiments on the Real-IAD dataset under the multi-class setting validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of +2.5 across 10 metrics at the sample/image/pixel levels, using only 18M parameters and requiring fewer FLOPs and training time.

However, existing spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM 2025), Cognitive Radio and AI-Enabled Network Symposium</p></details> | None |

However, real-world social media data exhibits an imbalanced distribution with a minority of rumors among massive regular posts. To address the data scarcity and imbalance issues, we construct two large-scale conversation datasets from Weibo and Twitter and analyze the domain distributions. We find obvious differences between rumor and non-rumor distributions, with non-rumors mostly in entertainment domains while rumors concentrate in news, indicating the conformity of rumor detection to an anomaly detection paradigm. Correspondingly, we propose the Anomaly Detection framework with Graph Supervised Contrastive Learning (AD-GSCL). It heuristically treats unlabeled data as non-rumors and adapts graph contrastive learning for rumor detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate AD-GSCL's superiority under class-balanced, imbalanced, and few-shot conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights for real-world rumor detection featuring imbalanced data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by COLING2025</p></details> | None |

Domain Adaptation (DA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a related source domain with abundant data. However, this adaptation process can introduce additional uncertainty, making it difficult to draw statistically valid conclusions from AD results. In this paper, we propose STAND-DA -- a novel framework for statistically rigorous Autoencoder-based AD after Representation Learning-based DA. Built on the Selective Inference (SI) framework, STAND-DA computes valid $p$-values for detected anomalies and rigorously controls the false positive rate below a pre-specified level $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). To address the computational challenges of applying SI to deep learning models, we develop the GPU-accelerated SI implementation, significantly enhancing both scalability and runtime performance. This advancement makes SI practically feasible for modern, large-scale deep architectures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the theoretical results and computational efficiency of the proposed STAND-DA method.</p></details> |  | None |

Although recent detection works have shifted to internal representations due to their rich cross-modal information, most methods rely on heuristic rules rather than principled objectives, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a novel unsupervised framework that formulates jailbreak detection as anomaly detection. LoD introduces two key components: Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors (MSCAV), which capture layer-wise safety-related representations across modalities, and the Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder, which models the distribution of MSCAV derived from safe inputs and detects anomalies via reconstruction errors. By training the auto-encoder (AE) solely on safe samples without attack labels, LoD naturally identifies jailbreak inputs as distributional anomalies, enabling accurate and unified detection of jailbreak attacks. Comprehensive experiments on three different LVLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate that LoD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average AUROC of 0.9951 and an improvement of up to 38.89% in the minimum AUROC over the strongest baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts, concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks: Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures | None |

Monitoring entropy variations across hierarchical system levels offers an alternative approach to identifying unauthorized data modifications without relying on static signatures. A framework leveraging hierarchical entropy disruption was introduced to analyze deviations in entropy distributions, capturing behavioral anomalies indicative of malicious encryption operations. Evaluating the framework across multiple ransomware variants demonstrated its capability to achieve high detection accuracy while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Entropy distributions across different system directories revealed that encryption activities predominantly targeted user-accessible files, aligning with observed attacker strategies. Detection latency analysis indicated that early-stage identification was feasible, mitigating potential data loss before critical system impact occurred. The framework's ability to operate efficiently in real-time environments was validated through an assessment of resource utilization, confirming a balanced trade-off between detection precision and computational efficiency. Comparative benchmarking against established detection methods highlighted the limitations of conventional approaches in identifying novel ransomware variants, whereas entropy-based anomaly detection provided resilience against obfuscation techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> | None |

Most existing frameworks approximate it through linear operations, which not only result in significant precision loss but also introduce substantial computational overhead. This paper proposes an efficient, verifiable, and accurate security 2-party logistic regression framework (EVA-S2PLoR), which achieves accurate nonlinear function computation through a subtly secure hadamard product protocol and its derived protocols. All protocols are based on a practical semi-honest security model, which is designed for decentralized privacy-preserving application scenarios that balance efficiency, precision, and security. High efficiency and precision are guaranteed by the asynchronous computation flow on floating point numbers and the few number of fixed communication rounds in the hadamard product protocol, where robust anomaly detection is promised by dimension transformation and Monte Carlo methods. EVA-S2PLoR outperforms many advanced frameworks in terms of precision, improving the performance of the sigmoid function by about 10 orders of magnitude compared to most frameworks. Moreover, EVA-S2PLoR delivers the best overall performance in secure logistic regression experiments with training time reduced by over 47.6% under WAN settings and a classification accuracy difference of only about 0.5% compared to the plaintext model.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings. In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system. To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance. Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.</p></details> | v0.1 | None |

Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for \task, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points (pp) in F1 score while using much less labeled data (62.87 pp reduction). When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 pp increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications, except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06318v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions), they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Membership Inference Attack with Partial Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06244v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models have been shown to be susceptible to membership inference attack, which can be used to determine whether a given sample appears in the training data. Existing membership inference methods commonly assume that the adversary has full access to the features of the target sample. This assumption, however, does not hold in many real-world scenarios where only partial features information is available, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we study an inference scenario where the adversary observes only partial features of each sample and aims to infer whether this observed subset was present in the training set of the target model. We define this problem as Partial Feature Membership Inference (PFMI). To address this problem, we propose MRAD (Memory-guided Reconstruction and Anomaly Detection), a two-stage attack framework. In the first stage, MRAD optimizes the unknown feature values to minimize the loss of the sample. In the second stage, it measures the deviation between the reconstructed sample and the training distribution using anomaly detection. Empirical results demonstrate that MRAD is effective across a range of datasets, and maintains compatibility with various off-the-shelf anomaly detection techniques. For example, on STL-10, our attack achieves an AUC of around 0.6 even with 40% of the missing features.</p></details> |  | None |

These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies: local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their respective domains.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional anomaly detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration. This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level, summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Entropy Causal Graphs for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09478v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many multivariate time series anomaly detection frameworks have been proposed and widely applied. However, most of these frameworks do not consider intrinsic relationships between variables in multivariate time series data, thus ignoring the causal relationship among variables and degrading anomaly detection performance. This work proposes a novel framework called CGAD, an entropy Causal Graph for multivariate time series Anomaly Detection. CGAD utilizes transfer entropy to construct graph structures that unveil the underlying causal relationships among time series data. Weighted graph convolutional networks combined with causal convolutions are employed to model both the causal graph structures and the temporal patterns within multivariate time series data. Furthermore, CGAD applies anomaly scoring, leveraging median absolute deviation-based normalization to improve the robustness of the anomaly identification process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with a 9% average improvement in terms of three different multivariate time series anomaly detection metrics.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures | None |

Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT) stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset (Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably, the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1) |

Traditional detection methods often struggle with class imbalance and limited supervision, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel two-phase learning framework to address these challenges. In the first phase, the Isolation Forest algorithm performs unsupervised anomaly detection to identify potential fraud cases and reduce the volume of data requiring further analysis. In the second phase, a self-training Support Vector Machine (SVM) refines the predictions using both labeled and high-confidence pseudo-labeled samples, enabling robust semi-supervised learning. The proposed method is evaluated on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset, a comprehensive real-world supply chain dataset with fraud indicators. It achieves an F1-score of 0.817 while maintaining a false positive rate below 3.0%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of combining unsupervised pre-filtering with semi-supervised refinement for supply chain fraud detection under real-world constraints, though we acknowledge limitations regarding concept drift and the need for comparison with deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Six P...</summary><p>Six Pages, two Figures and six Tables</p></details> | None |

Yet, real-world adoption remains limited due to persistent challenges such as scalability constraints, high computational demands, and complex privacy requirements. This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing blockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose optimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight cryptography, and decentralized identity management.

Epilepsy, one of the most prevalent neurological diseases worldwide, affects approximately the 1 \% of the population. These patients face significant risks, underscoring the need for reliable, continuous seizure monitoring in daily life. Most of the techniques discussed in the literature rely on supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods. However, the challenge of accurately labeling variations in epileptic EEG waveforms complicates the use of these approaches. Additionally, the rarity of ictal events introduces an high imbalancing within the data, which could lead to poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. Instead, a semi-supervised approach allows to train the model only on data not containing seizures, thus avoiding the issues related to the data imbalancing. This work proposes a semi-supervised approach for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG data, utilizing a novel Deep Learning-based method called SincVAE. This proposal incorporates the learning of an ad-hoc array of bandpass filter as a first layer of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), potentially eliminating the preprocessing stage where informative band frequencies are identified and isolated. Results indicate that SincVAE improves seizure detection in EEG data and is capable of identifying early seizures during the preictal stage as well as monitoring patients throughout the postictal stage.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we formalize the concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells'' for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for training will be released upon camera-ready submission.</p></details> |  | None |

As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

The remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) pave a new revenue by utilizing rich-text information for effective anomaly detection. However, simply introducing rich texts into LLMs can obscure essential detection cues and introduce high fine-tuning costs. Moreover, LLMs often overlook the intrinsic structural bias of graphs which is vital for distinguishing normal from abnormal node patterns. To this end, this paper introduces GuARD, a text-rich and graph-informed language model that combines key structural features from graph-based methods with fine-grained semantic attributes extracted via small language models for effective anomaly detection on text-rich graphs. GuARD is optimized with the progressive multi-modal multi-turn instruction tuning framework in the task-guided instruction tuning regime tailed to incorporate both rich-text and structural modalities. Extensive experiments on four datasets reveal that GuARD outperforms graph-based and LLM-based anomaly detection methods, while offering up to 5$\times$ times speedup in training and 5$\times$ times speedup in inference over vanilla long-context LLMs on the large-scale WhoIsWho dataset.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2025 | None |

However, conventional contrastive learning strategies often struggle to achieve this balance, either promoting excessive variance among inliers or failing to preserve the diversity of outliers. We begin by analyzing the challenges of representation learning for anomaly detection and identify three essential properties for the pretext task: (1) compact clustering of inliers, (2) strong separation between inliers and anomalies, and (3) preservation of diversity among synthetic outliers. Building on this, we propose a structured contrastive objective that redefines positive and negative relationships during training, promoting these properties without requiring explicit anomaly labels. We extend this framework with a patch-based learning and evaluation strategy specifically designed to improve the detection of localized anomalies in industrial settings. Our approach demonstrates significantly faster convergence and improved performance compared to standard contrastive methods. It matches or surpasses anomaly detection methods on both semantic and industrial benchmarks, including methods that rely on discriminative training or explicit anomaly labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025). 14 pages, 5 figures</p></details> | None |

However, the high dimensionality of these embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors. By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat event sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and multiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these limitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that transforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals, introducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal scales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral sequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are encoded using a Mamba-based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies, while the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match the encoder's output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused to construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a multilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom)</p></details> | None |

However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse sampling. However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1) the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in unsupervised settings. We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best model.

While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges, i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework, CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |

Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks.

Besides merely detecting if a product is anomalous or not, it is crucial to know the distinct type of defect, such as a bent, cut, or scratch. The ability to recognize the "exact" defect type enables automated treatments of the anomalies in modern production lines. Current methods are limited to solely detecting whether a product is defective or not without providing any insights on the defect type, nevertheless detecting and identifying multiple defects. We propose MultiADS, a zero-shot learning approach, able to perform Multi-type Anomaly Detection and Segmentation. The architecture of MultiADS comprises CLIP and extra linear layers to align the visual- and textual representation in a joint feature space. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal, is the first approach to perform a multi-type anomaly segmentation task in zero-shot learning. Contrary to the other baselines, our approach i) generates specific anomaly masks for each distinct defect type, ii) learns to distinguish defect types, and iii) simultaneously identifies multiple defect types present in an anomalous product. Additionally, our approach outperforms zero/few-shot learning SoTA methods on image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection and segmentation tasks on five commonly used datasets: MVTec-AD, Visa, MPDD, MAD and Real-IAD.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process that guides models from region identification to focused examination, generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and structural irregularities.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Risk-Based Thresholding for Reliable Anomaly Detection in Concentrated Solar Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19146v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and reliable operation of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants is essential for meeting the growing demand for sustainable energy. However, high-temperature solar receivers face severe operational risks, such as freezing, deformation, and corrosion, resulting in costly downtime and maintenance. To monitor CSP plants, cameras mounted on solar receivers record infrared images at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes throughout the day. Anomalous images can be detected by thresholding an anomaly score, where the threshold is chosen to optimize metrics such as the F1-score on a validation set. This work proposes a framework, using risk control, for generating more reliable decision thresholds with finite-sample coverage guarantees on any chosen risk function. Our framework also incorporates an abstention mechanism, allowing high-risk predictions to be deferred to domain experts. Second, we propose a density forecasting method to estimate the likelihood of an observed image given a sequence of previously observed images, using this likelihood as its anomaly score. Third, we analyze the deployment results of our framework across multiple training scenarios over several months for two CSP plants. This analysis provides valuable insights to our industry partner for optimizing maintenance operations. Finally, given the confidential nature of our dataset, we provide an extended simulated dataset, leveraging recent advancements in generative modeling to create diverse thermal images that simulate multiple CSP plants. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Active Learning and Transfer Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03921v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster (in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new samples to the training set using active learning does improve model performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points selected and labelled.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interpretable Estimation of CNN Deep Feature Density using Copula and the Generalized Characteristic Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05183v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel empirical approach toward estimating the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the deep features of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Estimating the PDF of deep CNN features is an important task, because it will yield new insight into deep representations. Moreover, characterizing the statistical behavior has implications for the feasibility of promising downstream tasks such as density based anomaly detection. Expressive, yet interpretable estimation of the deep feature PDF is challenging due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) as well as our limited ability to comprehend high-dimensional inter-dependencies. Our novel estimation technique combines copula analysis with the Method of Orthogonal Moments (MOM), in order to directly estimate the Generalized Characteristic Function (GCF) of the multivariate deep feature PDF. We find that the one-dimensional marginals of non-negative deep CNN features after major blocks are not well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, and that the features of deep layers are much better approximated by the Exponential, Gamma, and/or Weibull distributions. Furthermore, we observe that deep features become increasingly long-tailed with network depth, although surprisingly the rate of this increase is much slower than theoretical estimates. Finally, we observe that many deep features exhibit strong dependence (either correlation or anti-correlation) with other extremely strong detections, even if these features are independent within typical ranges. We elaborate on these findings in our discussion, where we hypothesize that the long-tail of large valued features corresponds to the strongest computer vision detections of semantic targets, which would imply that these large-valued features are not outliers but rather an important detection signal.</p></details> |  | None |

However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Quality-Aware Language-Conditioned Local Auto-Regressive Anomaly Synthesis and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03539v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic-aware Graph-guided Behavior Sequences Generation with Large Language Models for Smart Homes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03484v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines. However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third, we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by 85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

| **[CoPS: Conditional Prompt Synthesis for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03447v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis (CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling. Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism, extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and medical datasets.

Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art (SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score. However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs, translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare professionals.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Investigation on deep learning-based galaxy image translation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03291v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and cosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at A&A; 18+6 pages; 12+6 figures</p></details> | None |

Although empirical remedies exist, it is often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory. We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI and offer practical guidelines to address it.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version accepted at AISTATS 2025</p></details> | None |

The core innovation of our approach lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse, physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts. Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for pixel-level anomaly synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 2025 International Conference on Machine Intelligence and Nature-InspireD Computing (MIND)</p></details> | None |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong language understanding capabilities and hold promise for this task, their performance remains significantly inferior to that of human experts. In this context, we identify two key challenges: (i) insufficient integration of anomaly detection (AD) knowledge during pre-training, and (ii) the lack of technically precise and conte-aware language generation for anomaly reasoning. To address these issues, we propose ADSeeker, an anomaly task assistant designed to enhance inspection performance through knowledge-grounded reasoning. ADSeeker leverages a curated visual document knowledge base, SEEK-MVTec&VisA (SEEK-M&V), which we construct to address the limitations of existing resources that rely solely on unstructured text. SEEK-M&V includes semantic-rich descriptions and image-document pairs, enabling more comprehensive anomaly understanding. To effectively retrieve and utilize this knowledge, we introduce the Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Q2K RAG) framework. To further enhance the performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD), ADSeeker leverages the Hierarchical Sparse Prompt mechanism and type-level features to efficiently extract anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of limited in industry anomaly detection (IAD) data, we introduce the largest-scale AD dataset, Multi-type Anomaly (MulA), encompassing 72 multi-scale defect types across 26 Categories. Extensive experiments show that our plug-and-play framework, ADSeeker, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, accurately localizing anomalies remains challenging due to the intricate structure of brain anatomy and the scarcity of abnormal examples. In this work, we introduce REFLECT, a novel framework that leverages rectified flows to establish a direct, linear trajectory for correcting abnormal MR images toward a normal distribution. By learning a straight, one-step correction transport map, our method efficiently corrects brain anomalies and can precisely localize anomalies by detecting discrepancies between anomalous input and corrected counterpart. In contrast to the diffusion-based UAD models, which require iterative stochastic sampling, rectified flows provide a direct transport map, enabling single-step inference.

When a single model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly, previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap. However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios, determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world multi-class anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Harnessing Controllable Overfitting for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00560v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overfitting has traditionally been viewed as detrimental to anomaly detection, where excessive generalization often limits models' sensitivity to subtle anomalies. Our work challenges this conventional view by introducing Controllable Overfitting-based Anomaly Detection (COAD), a novel framework that strategically leverages overfitting to enhance anomaly discrimination capabilities. We propose the Aberrance Retention Quotient (ARQ), a novel metric that systematically quantifies the extent of overfitting, enabling the identification of an optimal golden overfitting interval wherein model sensitivity to anomalies is maximized without sacrificing generalization. To comprehensively capture how overfitting affects detection performance, we further propose the Relative Anomaly Distribution Index (RADI), a metric superior to traditional AUROC by explicitly modeling the separation between normal and anomalous score distributions. Theoretically, RADI leverages ARQ to track and evaluate how overfitting impacts anomaly detection, offering an integrated approach to understanding the relationship between overfitting dynamics and model efficacy. We also rigorously validate the statistical efficacy of Gaussian noise as pseudo-anomaly generators, reinforcing the method's broad applicability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our controllable overfitting method achieves State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) performance in both one-class and multi-class anomaly detection tasks, thus redefining overfitting as a powerful strategy rather than a limitation.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing synthetic strategies (e.g., cut-and-paste) overlook the underlying physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this paper, we introduce a novel and lightweight pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through Math-Phys model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality Estimator (SQE). By combining physical modeling of the three most typical physics-driven defect mechanisms: Fracture Line (FL), Pitting Loss (PL), and Plastic Warpage (PW), our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage (npcF++) further improves local fidelity. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To validate our method, we conduct experiments on three anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD. Across these datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in both image- and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of our MaPhC2F dataset and BiSQAD method.

This assumption simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ieee/cvf international conference on computer vision (ICCV2025)</p></details> | None |

In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand. We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events, specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print v0.8 2025-08-04</p></details> | None |

These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity, hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed. Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse. To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and resolution.</p></details> | 35 pages | None |

While prior studies have largely employed reconstruction-based approaches, which limit the models' representational capacities. Moreover, existing deep learning-based methods are not sufficiently lightweight. Addressing these issues, we present PatchAD, our novel, highly efficient multiscale patch-based MLP-Mixer architecture that utilizes contrastive learning for representation extraction and anomaly detection. With its four distinct MLP Mixers and innovative dual project constraint module, PatchAD mitigates potential model degradation and offers a lightweight solution, requiring only $0.403M$ parameters. Its efficacy is demonstrated by state-of-the-art results across $8$ datasets sourced from different application scenarios, outperforming over $30$ comparative algorithms. PatchAD significantly improves the classical F1 score by 6.84%, the Aff-F1 score by 4.27%, and the V-ROC by 2.49%. Simultaneously, an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying PatchAD has been conducted from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, validating the design motivations of the model.

Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting. These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Navigated Residual Mamba for Universal Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01591v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages ``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions. Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD, MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figure,submitted to AAAI2026</p></details> | None |
| **[SpectrumFM: A New Paradigm for Spectrum Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02742v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The enhancement of spectrum efficiency and the realization of secure spectrum utilization are critically dependent on spectrum cognition. However, existing spectrum cognition methods often exhibit limited generalization and suboptimal accuracy when deployed across diverse spectrum environments and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, which provides a new paradigm for spectrum cognition. An innovative spectrum encoder that exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self attention mechanisms is proposed to effectively capture both fine-grained local signal structures and high-level global dependencies in the spectrum data. To enhance its adaptability, two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, are developed for pre-training SpectrumFM, enabling the model to learn rich and transferable representations. Furthermore, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameter-efficient fine-tuning is exploited to enable SpectrumFM to seamlessly adapt to various downstream spectrum cognition tasks, including spectrum sensing (SS), anomaly detection (AD), and wireless technology classification (WTC). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SpectrumFM over state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves detection probability in the SS task by 30% at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), boosts the area under the curve (AUC) in the AD task by over 10%, and enhances WTC accuracy by 9.6%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM 2025), Cognitive Radio and AI-Enabled Network Symposium</p></details> | None |
| **[AI-Driven Cybersecurity Threat Detection: Building Resilient Defense Systems Using Predictive Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01422v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines how Artificial Intelligence can aid in identifying and mitigating cyber threats in the U.S. across four key areas: intrusion detection, malware classification, phishing detection, and insider threat analysis. Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be different approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the problem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we tested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep autoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network traffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic logs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features. These models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the easiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different story. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user activity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of harmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a threat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw across the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex model. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data behaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But for messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence models and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs. The takeaway here is clear in cybersecurity, context drives the solution.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[C3D-AD: Toward Continual 3D Anomaly Detection via Kernel Attention with Learnable Advisor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01311v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module, to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor (KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder. Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers previous category information and returns category-adaptive representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of 66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have provided the code for C3D-AD with checkpoints and BASELINE at this link: https://github.com/hzzzzzhappy/CL3AD</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/hzzzzzhappy/CL3AD) |
| **[Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI Using a Domain-Agnostic Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01137v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and 578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing (unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization, skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7% (image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset, indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its potential for real-world clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 6 figures and 4 tables in main text, 17 pages supplementary material with 3 tables and 3 figures; Submitted to Radiology: Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |
| **[DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance System using Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01136v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>DBAIO...</summary><p>DBAIOps supports 25 database systems and has been deployed in 20 real-world scenarios, covering domains like finance, energy, and healthcare.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.

In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points) for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each type.

| **[Anomaly Detection in Double-entry Bookkeeping Data by Federated Learning System with Non-model Sharing Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12723v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is crucial in financial auditing, and effective detection requires large volumes of data from multiple organizations. However, journal entry data is highly sensitive, making it infeasible to share them directly across audit firms. To address this challenge, journal entry anomaly detection methods based on model share-type federated learning (FL) have been proposed. These methods require multiple rounds of communication with external servers to exchange model parameters, which necessitates connecting devices storing confidential data to external networks -- a practice not recommended for sensitive data such as journal entries. To overcome these limitations, a novel anomaly detection framework based on data collaboration (DC) analysis, a non-model share-type FL approach, is proposed. The method first transforms raw journal entry data into secure intermediate representations via dimensionality reduction and then constructs a collaboration representation used to train an anomaly detection autoencoder. Notably, the approach does not require raw data to be exposed or devices to be connected to external networks, and the entire process needs only a single round of communication. The proposed method was evaluated on both synthetic and real-world journal entry data collected from eight healthcare organizations. The experimental results demonstrated that the framework not only outperforms the baseline trained on individual data but also achieves higher detection performance than model-sharing FL methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, particularly under non-i.i.d. settings that simulate practical audit environments. This study addresses the critical need to integrate organizational knowledge while preserving data confidentiality, contributing to the development of practical intelligent auditing systems.</p></details> | 28 pages | None |

While significant progress has been made in algorithmic recourse for static data, such as tabular and image data, limited research explores recourse for multivariate time series, particularly for reversing abnormal time series. This paper introduces Recourse in time series Anomaly Detection (RecAD), a framework for addressing anomalies in multivariate time series using backtracking counterfactual reasoning. By modeling the causes of anomalies as external interventions on exogenous variables, RecAD predicts recourse actions to restore normal status as counterfactual explanations, where the recourse function, responsible for generating actions based on observed data, is trained using an end-to-end approach. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs, leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation.

We propose a novel architectural framework that incorporates these technologies to significantly improve predictive maintenance, network scenario simulation, and real-time data-driven decision-making. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate how generative AI can enhance the accuracy and operational efficiency of network digital twins, effectively handling real-world complexities such as unpredictable traffic loads and network failures.

However, existing ZSAD methods, whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2) a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data. Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and localization under domain shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2025</p></details> | None |

Denoising autoencoders rely on fixed-magnitude noise, limiting adaptability to diverse data distributions. Diffusion models introduce scheduled noise and iterative denoising, but lack explicit reconstruction mappings. We propose the Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), a framework that integrates diffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into the encoding process to improve anomaly detection. We evaluated DDAE on 57 datasets from ADBench. Our method outperforms in semi-supervised settings and achieves competitive results in unsupervised settings, improving PR-AUC by up to 65% (9%) and ROC-AUC by 16% (6%) over state-of-the-art autoencoder (diffusion) model baselines. We observed that higher noise levels benefit unsupervised training, while lower noise with linear scheduling is optimal in semi-supervised settings.

| **[Bagged Regularized $k$-Distances for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01046v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the paradigm of unsupervised anomaly detection, which involves the identification of anomalies within a dataset in the absence of labeled examples. Though distance-based methods are top-performing for unsupervised anomaly detection, they suffer heavily from the sensitivity to the choice of the number of the nearest neighbors. In this paper, we propose a new distance-based algorithm called bagged regularized $k$-distances for anomaly detection (BRDAD), converting the unsupervised anomaly detection problem into a convex optimization problem. Our BRDAD algorithm selects the weights by minimizing the surrogate risk, i.e., the finite sample bound of the empirical risk of the bagged weighted $k$-distances for density estimation (BWDDE). This approach enables us to successfully address the sensitivity challenge of the hyperparameter choice in distance-based algorithms. Moreover, when dealing with large-scale datasets, the efficiency issues can be addressed by the incorporated bagging technique in our BRDAD algorithm. On the theoretical side, we establish fast convergence rates of the AUC regret of our algorithm and demonstrate that the bagging technique significantly reduces the computational complexity. On the practical side, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the insensitivity of the parameter selection of our algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art distance-based methods. Furthermore, our method achieves superior performance on real-world datasets with the introduced bagging technique compared to other approaches.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DP-DGAD: A Generalist Dynamic Graph Anomaly Detector with Dynamic Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00664v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies in evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social networks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown promising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and generalize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to capture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous emergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge generalist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and domain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve temporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and domain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e., evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal ego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively updated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new domain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with dynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally, DP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text-Attributed Graph Anomaly Detection via Multi-Scale Cross- and Uni-Modal Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00513v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of graph data in various high-risk scenarios has increased attention to graph anomaly detection (GAD). Faced with real-world graphs that often carry node descriptions in the form of raw text sequences, termed text-attributed graphs (TAGs), existing graph anomaly detection pipelines typically involve shallow embedding techniques to encode such textual information into features, and then rely on complex self-supervised tasks within the graph domain to detect anomalies. However, this text encoding process is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph domain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus on GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability. How to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast potential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging issue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed graph anomaly detection, named CMUCL. We simultaneously model data from both text and graph structures, and jointly train text and graph encoders by leveraging cross-modal and uni-modal multi-scale consistency to uncover potential anomaly-related information. Accordingly, we design an anomaly score estimator based on inconsistency mining to derive node-specific anomaly scores. Considering the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for anomaly detection on TAGs, we release 8 datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive evaluations show that CMUCL significantly advances in text-attributed graph anomaly detection, delivering an 11.13% increase in average accuracy (AP) over the suboptimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on designing complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking the complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often encoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so that semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the enormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly detection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural information inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For high-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that combines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary strengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented generation to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable rationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped with a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while preserving high-order topological information.

| **[HyPCV-Former: Hyperbolic Spatio-Temporal Transformer for 3D Point Cloud Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00473v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GV-VAD : Exploring Video Generation for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00312v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets.

| **[PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951v5)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Big Data Research journal</p></details> | None |
| **[Anomaly detection with spiking neural networks for LHC physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00063v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection offers a promising strategy for discovering new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This paper investigates AutoEncoders built using neuromorphic Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for this purpose. One key application is at the trigger level, where anomaly detection tools could capture signals that would otherwise be discarded by conventional selection cuts. These systems must operate under strict latency and computational constraints. SNNs are inherently well-suited for low-latency, low-memory, real-time inference, particularly on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Further gains are expected with the rapid progress in dedicated neuromorphic hardware development. Using the CMS ADC2021 dataset, we design and evaluate a simple SNN AutoEncoder architecture. Our results show that the SNN AutoEncoders are competitive with conventional AutoEncoders for LHC anomaly detection across all signal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 15 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |
| **[TriP-LLM: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00047v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git) |
| **[Towards Reliable AI in 6G: Detecting Concept Drift in Wireless Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00042v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-native 6G networks promise unprecedented automation and performance by embedding machine-learning models throughout the radio access and core segments of the network. However, the non-stationary nature of wireless environments due to infrastructure changes, user mobility, and emerging traffic patterns, induces concept drifts that can quickly degrade these model accuracies. Existing methods in general are very domain specific, or struggle with certain type of concept drift. In this paper, we introduce two unsupervised, model-agnostic, batch concept drift detectors. Both methods compute an expected-utility score to decide when concept drift occurred and if model retraining is warranted, without requiring ground-truth labels after deployment. We validate our framework on two real-world wireless use cases in outdoor fingerprinting for localization and for link-anomaly detection, and demonstrate that both methods are outperforming classical detectors such as ADWIN, DDM, CUSUM by 20-40 percentage points. Additionally, they achieve an F1-score of 0.94 and 1.00 in correctly triggering retraining alarm, thus reducing the false alarm rate by up to 20 percentage points compared to the best classical detectors.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Anomalous Samples for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23712v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular industrial anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[L-GTA: Latent Generative Modeling for Time Series Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23615v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Applications of Medical AI (AMAI workshop) at MICCAI 2025 (submitted version)</p></details> | None |

Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection. We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its performance against other methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Our benchmark, Continual-MEGA, includes a large and diverse dataset that significantly expands existing evaluation settings by combining carefully curated existing datasets with our newly proposed dataset, ContinualAD. In addition to standard continual learning with expanded quantity, we propose a novel scenario that measures zero-shot generalization to unseen classes, those not observed during continual adaptation. This setting poses a new problem setting that continual adaptation also enhances zero-shot performance. We also present a unified baseline algorithm that improves robustness in few-shot detection and maintains strong generalization. Through extensive evaluations, we report three key findings: (1) existing methods show substantial room for improvement, particularly in pixel-level defect localization; (2) our proposed method consistently outperforms prior approaches; and (3) the newly introduced ContinualAD dataset enhances the performance of strong anomaly detection models. We release the benchmark and code in https://github.com/Continual-Mega/Continual-Mega.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Continual-Mega/Continual-Mega) |

With very large monitoring databases becoming expensive to explore, the use of AI and Generative AI can help reduce costs of managing these datasets. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize network monitoring management by addressing the limitations of query finding and pattern analysis. We leverage LLMs to enhance anomaly detection, automate root-cause analysis, and automate incident analysis to build a well-monitored network management team using AI. Through a real-world example of developing our own OFCNetLLM, based on the open-source LLM model, we demonstrate practical applications of OFCnetLLM in the OFC conference network. Our model is developed as a multi-agent approach and is still evolving, and we present early results here.</p></details> |  | None |

We revisit diffusion models, not as generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others, highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation models in anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop of Anomaly Detection with Foundation Models, ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditional inspection methods rely heavily on the manual review of CCTV footage collected by mobile robots, which is inefficient and susceptible to human error. To automate this process, we propose a novel system incorporating explainable deep learning anomaly detection combined with sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT). The anomaly detector processes single image frames, providing interpretable spatial localisation of anomalies, whilst the SPRT introduces temporal evidence aggregation, enhancing robustness against noise over sequences of image frames. Experimental results demonstrate improved anomaly detection performance, highlighting the benefits of the combined spatiotemporal analysis system for reliable and robust sewer inspection.</p></details> |  | None |

Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task, limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover, they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains, hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction, and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives. Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a fully unsupervised manner.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose an \emph{Adaptive State-Space Mamba} (\textbf{ASSM}) framework for real-time sensor data anomaly detection. While state-space models have been previously employed for image processing applications (e.g., style transfer \cite{wang2024stylemamba}), our approach leverages the core idea of sequential hidden states to tackle a significantly different domain: detecting anomalies on streaming sensor data. In particular, we introduce an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically modulates the hidden state update based on contextual and learned statistical cues. This design ensures that our model remains computationally efficient and scalable, even under rapid data arrival rates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic sensor datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance compared to existing baselines. Our approach is easily extensible to other time-series tasks that demand rapid and reliable detection capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship and affiliation</p></details> | None |
