| **[Unmasking Performance Gaps: A Comparative Study of Human Anonymization and Its Effects on Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14083v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques, including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU, BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns. These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands of anomaly detection.</p></details> | ACIVS 2025 | None |
| **[Robust Anomaly Detection with Graph Neural Networks using Controllability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13954v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2) encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies, highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference paper published in IEEE CAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Efficient and Scalable Self-Healing Databases Using Meta-Learning and Dependency-Driven Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13757v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explored the development of a novel self-healing framework for databases using meta-learning and reinforcement learning techniques. The primary objective was to address the challenges of real-time adaptability and minimal retraining in dynamic workload environments. The proposed approach integrated Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) with reinforcement learning to enable anomaly detection and corrective actions that adapted swiftly to evolving database conditions. Multi-objective optimization was employed to balance performance, resource utilization, and cost efficiency during the healing process. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were incorporated to model interdependencies within database components, ensuring holistic recovery strategies. Data efficiency was enhanced through synthetic task augmentation and self-supervised learning, enabling effective training in sparse data regimes. To promote trust and transparency, explainable AI techniques were integrated to provide interpretable insights into anomaly detection and healing actions. Federated meta-learning further enabled privacy-preserving adaptability in distributed database environments. The framework demonstrated significant improvements in adaptability, efficiency, and reliability, contributing to advancements in database management and self-healing systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks-based GRU and LSTM for Loan Default Early Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13685v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses a critical challenge in time series anomaly detection: enhancing the predictive capability of loan default models more than three months in advance to enable early identification of default events, helping financial institutions implement preventive measures before risk events materialize. Existing methods have significant drawbacks, such as their lack of accuracy in early predictions and their dependence on training and testing within the same year and specific time frames. These issues limit their practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months in advance and over 88% eight months in advance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Position: Untrained Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection by using 3D Point Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03876v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection based on 3D point cloud data is an important research problem and receives more and more attention recently. Untrained anomaly detection based on only one sample is an emerging research problem motivated by real manufacturing industries such as personalized manufacturing where only one sample can be collected without any additional labels and historical datasets. Identifying anomalies accurately based on one 3D point cloud sample is a critical challenge in both industrial applications and the field of machine learning. This paper aims to provide a formal definition of the untrained anomaly detection problem based on 3D point cloud data, discuss the differences between untrained anomaly detection and current unsupervised anomaly detection problems. Unlike trained unsupervised learning, untrained unsupervised learning does not rely on any data, including unlabeled data. Instead, they leverage prior knowledge about the surfaces and anomalies. We propose three complementary methodological frameworks: the Latent Variable Inference Framework that employs probabilistic modeling to distinguish anomalies; the Decomposition Framework that separates point clouds into reference, anomaly, and noise components through sparse learning; and the Local Geometry Framework that leverages neighborhood information for anomaly identification. Experimental results demonstrate that untrained methods achieve competitive detection performance while offering significant computational advantages, demonstrating up to a 15-fold increase in execution speed. The proposed methods provide viable solutions for scenarios with extreme data scarcity, addressing critical challenges in personalized manufacturing and healthcare applications where collecting multiple samples or historical data is infeasible.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figure | None |
| **[Salvaging the Overlooked: Leveraging Class-Aware Contrastive Learning for Multi-Class Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04769v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For anomaly detection (AD), early approaches often train separate models for individual classes, yielding high performance but posing challenges in scalability and resource management. Recent efforts have shifted toward training a single model capable of handling multiple classes. However, directly extending early AD methods to multi-class settings often results in degraded performance. In this paper, we investigate this performance degradation observed in reconstruction-based methods, identifying the key issue: inter-class confusion. This confusion emerges when a model trained in multi-class scenarios incorrectly reconstructs samples from one class as those of another, thereby exacerbating reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective modification, called class-aware contrastive learning (CCL). By explicitly leveraging raw object category information (\eg carpet or wood) as supervised signals, we introduce local CL to refine multiscale dense features, and global CL to obtain more compact feature representations of normal patterns, thereby effectively adapting the models to multi-class settings. Experiments across five datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, ablation studies indicate that pseudo-class labels can achieve comparable performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV2025, https://lgc-ad.github.io/</p></details> | None |
| **[3DKeyAD: High-Resolution 3D Point Cloud Anomaly Detection via Keypoint-Guided Point Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13110v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution 3D point clouds are highly effective for detecting subtle structural anomalies in industrial inspection. However, their dense and irregular nature imposes significant challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to spatial misalignment, and difficulty in capturing localized structural differences. This paper introduces a registration-based anomaly detection framework that combines multi-prototype alignment with cluster-wise discrepancy analysis to enable precise 3D anomaly localization. Specifically, each test sample is first registered to multiple normal prototypes to enable direct structural comparison. To evaluate anomalies at a local level, clustering is performed over the point cloud, and similarity is computed between features from the test sample and the prototypes within each cluster. Rather than selecting cluster centroids randomly, a keypoint-guided strategy is employed, where geometrically informative points are chosen as centroids. This ensures that clusters are centered on feature-rich regions, enabling more meaningful and stable distance-based comparisons. Extensive experiments on the Real3D-AD benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both object-level and point-level anomaly detection, even using only raw features.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fault detection and diagnosis for the engine electrical system of a space launcher based on a temporal convolutional autoencoder and calibrated classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13022v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases, and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios. The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the required maturity level for operational use.</p></details> | 53 pages, 16 figures | None |
| **[ProDisc-VAD: An Efficient System for Weakly-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Video Surveillance Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02179v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) suffers from label ambiguity, hindering discriminative feature learning. We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP.

| **[A Semi-Supervised Learning Method for the Identification of Bad Exposures in Large Imaging Surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12784v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases, traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures | None |
| **[Text-ADBench: Text Anomaly Detection Benchmark based on LLMs Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12295v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI (small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media, scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC). Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes all embeddings from different models and code at https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark) |

The system combines distributed feature extraction, dynamic privacy budget allocation, and robust model aggregation to balance model accuracy, communication overhead, and privacy protection. Multi-party secure computing and anomaly detection mechanisms further enhance system resilience against malicious attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves dual optimization of recommendation accuracy and system efficiency while ensuring privacy, providing both a practical solution and a theoretical foundation for applying privacy protection technologies in advertisement recommendation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MoViAD: Modular Visual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12049v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>VAD is a critical field in machine learning focused on identifying deviations from normal patterns in images, often challenged by the scarcity of anomalous data and the need for unsupervised training. To accelerate research and deployment in this domain, we introduce MoViAD, a comprehensive and highly modular library designed to provide fast and easy access to state-of-the-art VAD models, trainers, datasets, and VAD utilities. MoViAD supports a wide array of scenarios, including continual, semi-supervised, few-shots, noisy, and many more. In addition, it addresses practical deployment challenges through dedicated Edge and IoT settings, offering optimized models and backbones, along with quantization and compression utilities for efficient on-device execution and distributed inference. MoViAD integrates a selection of backbones, robust evaluation VAD metrics (pixel-level and image-level) and useful profiling tools for efficiency analysis. The library is designed for fast, effortless deployment, enabling machine learning engineers to easily use it for their specific setup with custom models, datasets, and backbones. At the same time, it offers the flexibility and extensibility researchers need to develop and experiment with new methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Computational Theory and Semi-Supervised Algorithm for Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06974v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A computational theory for clustering and a semi-supervised clustering algorithm is presented. Clustering is defined to be the obtainment of groupings of data such that each group contains no anomalies with respect to a chosen grouping principle and measure; all other examples are considered to be fringe points, isolated anomalies, anomalous clusters or unknown clusters. More precisely, after appropriate modelling under the assumption of uniform random distribution, any example whose expectation of occurrence is <1 with respect to a group is considered an anomaly; otherwise it is assigned a membership of that group. Thus, clustering is conceived as the dual of anomaly detection. The representation of data is taken to be the Euclidean distance of a point to a cluster median. This is due to the robustness properties of the median to outliers, its approximate location of centrality and so that decision boundaries are general purpose. The kernel of the clustering method is the perception anomaly detection algorithm, resulting in a parameter-free, fast, and efficient clustering algorithm. Acknowledging that clustering is an interactive and iterative process, the algorithm relies on a small fraction of known relationships between examples. These relationships serve as seeds to define the user's objectives and guide the clustering process. The method then expands the clusters accordingly, leaving the remaining examples for exploration and subsequent iterations. Results are presented on synthetic and realworld data sets, demonstrating the advantages over the most popular unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Its a significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19 related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD) algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established norms.</p></details> | <details><summary>CSAID...</summary><p>CSAIDE '25: Proceedings of the 2025 4th International Conference on Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence and the Digital Economy</p></details> | None |

They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 ICML Workshop on Machine Learning for Astrophysics, Code available at: https://github.com/StevenDillmann/ml-xraytransients-mnras</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/StevenDillmann/ml-xraytransients-mnras) |
| **[LogTinyLLM: Tiny Large Language Models Based Contextual Log Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11071v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log anomaly detection using traditional rule based or deep learning based methods is often challenging due to the large volume and highly complex nature of log sequence. So effective way of detection of anomalous sequence of logs is crucial for system maintenance and development. This paper proposes parameter efficient finetuning specifically low rank adaptation (LoRA) and adapter based approaches for finding contextual anomalies in sequence of logs in large log data set. It compares different tiny large language models (LLMs) on the Thunderbird dataset. The results show that LoRA based finetuning provides substantial performance improvements of 18 to 19 percentage over LogBert based full finetuning approach, achieving accuracy scores between 97.76% and 98.83% compared to 79.37%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comprehensive Library for Benchmarking Multi-class Visual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03262v4)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous regions in images through unsupervised learning paradigms, with increasing application demand and value in fields such as industrial inspection and medical lesion detection. Despite significant progress in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to adequately evaluate the performance of various mainstream methods across different datasets under the practical multi-class setting. The absence of standardized experimental setups can lead to potential biases in training epochs, resolution, and metric results, resulting in erroneous conclusions. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a comprehensive visual anomaly detection benchmark, ADer, which is a modular framework that is highly extensible for new methods. The benchmark includes multiple datasets from industrial and medical domains, implementing fifteen state-of-the-art methods and nine comprehensive metrics. Additionally, we have proposed the GPU-assisted ADEval package to address the slow evaluation problem of metrics like time-consuming mAU-PRO on large-scale data, significantly reducing evaluation time by more than \textit{1000-fold}. Through extensive experimental results, we objectively reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and provide insights into the challenges and future directions of multi-class visual anomaly detection. We hope that ADer will become a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, promoting the development of more robust and generalizable anomaly detection systems.

| **[Bridge Feature Matching and Cross-Modal Alignment with Mutual-filtering for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11003v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image. However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local \textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction, e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by +4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SimAD: A Simple Dissimilarity-based Approach for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11238v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the prevalence of reconstruction-based deep learning methods, time series anomaly detection remains a tremendous challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with limited temporal contexts, insufficient representation of normal patterns, and flawed evaluation metrics, all of which hinder their effectiveness in detecting anomalous behavior. To address these issues, we introduce a $\textbf{Sim}$ple dissimilarity-based approach for time series $\textbf{A}$nomaly $\textbf{D}$etection, referred to as $\textbf{SimAD}$. Specifically, SimAD first incorporates a patching-based feature extractor capable of processing extended temporal windows and employs the EmbedPatch encoder to fully integrate normal behavioral patterns. Second, we design an innovative ContrastFusion module in SimAD, which strengthens the robustness of anomaly detection by highlighting the distributional differences between normal and abnormal data. Third, we introduce two robust enhanced evaluation metrics, Unbiased Affiliation (UAff) and Normalized Affiliation (NAff), designed to overcome the limitations of existing metrics by providing better distinctiveness and semantic clarity. The reliability of these two metrics has been demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental analyses. Experiments conducted on seven diverse time series datasets clearly demonstrate SimAD's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative improvements of $\textbf{19.85%}$ on F1, $\textbf{4.44%}$ on Aff-F1, $\textbf{77.79%}$ on NAff-F1, and $\textbf{9.69%}$ on AUC on six multivariate datasets.

| **[Real-time, Adaptive Radiological Anomaly Detection and Isotope Identification Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10715v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are integral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search operations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Spectral Feature Extraction for Robust Network Intrusion Detection Using MFCCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10622v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has led to a surge in security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for robust anomaly detection and classification techniques. In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks. Learnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the temporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional fixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling more effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths of MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering a powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on three widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and IoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating adaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to achieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network landscapes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[BenchReAD: A systematic benchmark for retinal anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10492v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark, which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies. Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups. Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples), overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD) |
| **[Causality-informed Anomaly Detection in Partially Observable Sensor Networks: Moving beyond Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09742v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover, although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adversarial Activation Patching: A Framework for Detecting and Mitigating Emergent Deception in Safety-Aligned Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09406v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCVW...</summary><p>ICCVW 2025 accepted.

| **[Stereo-based 3D Anomaly Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A New Dataset and Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09214v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving, with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road, 3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm, which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue. Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the dataset is verified in the experiments.

However, the architectural framework and intelligent resource orchestration strategies necessary to realize this vision remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a Converged AI-and-ORAN Architectural (CAORA) framework based on O-RAN specifications, enabling the dynamic coexistence of real-time RAN and computationally intensive AI workloads. We design custom xApps within the Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (NRT-RIC) to monitor RAN KPIs and expose radio analytics to an End-to-End (E2E) orchestrator via the recently introduced Y1 interface. The orchestrator incorporates workload forecasting and anomaly detection modules, augmenting a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning agent that proactively manages resource allocation, including Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) partitioning. Using real-world 5G traffic traces from Barcelona, our trace-driven simulations demonstrate that CAORA achieves near 99\% fulfillment of RAN demands, supports dynamic AI workloads, and maximizes infrastructure utilization even under highly dynamic conditions. Our results reveal that predictive orchestration significantly improves system adaptability, resource efficiency, and service continuity, offering a viable blueprint for future AI-and-RAN converged 6G systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking.

| **[InferLog: Accelerating LLM Inference for Online Log Parsing via ICL-oriented Prefix Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08523v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs, necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data Depth as a Risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08518v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data depths are score functions that quantify in an unsupervised fashion how central is a point inside a distribution, with numerous applications such as anomaly detection, multivariate or functional data analysis, arising across various fields. The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising the notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety of depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth. Taking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the halfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of classifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the set of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of "loss depths", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or logistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits computational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as their fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a connection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity of the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation as a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for anomaly detection, as is shown by experiments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rethinking Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection: A Vision for Causality-Driven Cybersecurity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08177v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable, adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Under Review in Vision Paper Track-ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> | None |

This limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning, consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses. To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation (MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

Nevertheless, its reliance on large, task-specific annotated datasets for every new task limits widespread implementation on shop floors. While emerging sound foundation models aim to alleviate data dependency, they are too large and computationally expensive, requiring cloud infrastructure or high-end hardware that is impractical for on-site, real-time deployment. We address this gap with LISTEN (Lightweight Industrial Sound-representable Transformer for Edge Notification), a kilobyte-sized industrial sound foundation model. Using knowledge distillation, LISTEN runs in real-time on low-cost edge devices. On benchmark downstream tasks, it performs nearly identically to its much larger parent model, even when fine-tuned with minimal datasets and training resource. Beyond the model itself, we demonstrate its real-world utility by integrating LISTEN into a complete machine monitoring framework on an edge device with an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensor and system, validating its performance and generalization capabilities on a live manufacturing shop floor.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector. State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality, high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories, covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the demands of modern manufacturing environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Typically, automata learning techniques operate in a supervised learning setting (active or passive) where they learn a finite state machine in contexts where additional information, such as labeled system executions, is available. However, other settings, such as learning from unlabeled data - an important aspect in machine learning - remain unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a given multi-set of unlabeled words. We show that this problem is computationally hard and develop three learning algorithms based on constraint optimization. Moreover, we introduce novel regularization schemes for our optimization problems that improve the overall interpretability of our DFAs.

At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, to be submitted to Advanced Intelligent Systems</p></details> | None |

The demand for real-time AD has surged with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach. Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time, high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores. These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets, including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61% accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates.

However, existing task-specific, supervised learning methods often scale poorly and fail to generalize across diverse industrial scenarios, whose acoustic characteristics are distinct from general audio. Furthermore, the scarcity of accessible, large-scale datasets and pretrained models tailored for industrial audio impedes community-driven research and benchmarking. To address these challenges, we introduce DINOS (Diverse INdustrial Operation Sounds), a large-scale open-access dataset. DINOS comprises over 74,149 audio samples (exceeding 1,093 hours) collected from various industrial acoustic scenarios. We also present IMPACT (Industrial Machine Perception via Acoustic Cognitive Transformer), a novel foundation model for industrial machine sound analysis. IMPACT is pretrained on DINOS in a self-supervised manner. By jointly optimizing utterance and frame-level losses, it captures both global semantics and fine-grained temporal structures. This makes its representations suitable for efficient fine-tuning on various industrial downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. Comprehensive benchmarking across 30 distinct downstream tasks (spanning four machine types) demonstrates that IMPACT outperforms existing models on 24 tasks, establishing its superior effectiveness and robustness, while providing a new performance benchmark for future research.</p></details> |  | None |

The numerical evaluation of such depth functions can be computationally prohibitive, even for relatively low dimensions. We present a novel sequentially implemented Monte Carlo methodology for the computation of, theoretical and empirical, depth functions and related quantities (seMCD), that outputs an interval, a so-called seMCD-bucket, to which the quantity of interest belongs with a high probability prespecified by the user. For specific classes of depth functions, we adapt algorithms from sequential testing, providing finite-sample guarantees. For depth functions dependent on unknown distributions, we offer asymptotic guarantees using non-parametric statistical methods. In contrast to plain-vanilla Monte Carlo methodology the number of samples required in the algorithm is random but typically much smaller than standard choices suggested in the literature. The seMCD method can be applied to various depth functions, covering multivariate and functional spaces. We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of our approach through empirical studies, highlighting its applicability in outlier or anomaly detection, classification, and depth region computation.

| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection through Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12793v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in datasets is a longstanding problem in machine learning. In this context, anomalies are defined as a sample that significantly deviates from the remaining data. Meanwhile, optimal transport (OT) is a field of mathematics concerned with the transportation, between two probability measures, at least effort. In classical OT, the optimal transportation strategy of a measure to itself is the identity. In this paper, we tackle anomaly detection by forcing samples to displace its mass, while keeping the least effort objective. We call this new transportation problem Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport (MROT). Naturally, samples lying in low density regions of space will be forced to displace mass very far, incurring a higher transportation cost. We use these concepts to design a new anomaly score. Through a series of experiments in existing benchmarks, and fault detection problems, we show that our algorithm improves over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables, accepted at the Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> | None |

Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence, military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models, representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths, limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets.

Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.</p></details> | 11 pages, ICML 2025 | None |

This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> | None |

The situation becomes more complicated when such attacks are more evasive and operate sporadically to stay hidden from detection mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce Intermittent Thermal Trojans (iThermTroj) that exploit the chips' thermal information in a random time-triggered manner. According to our experiments, iThermTroj attack can easily bypass available threshold-based thermal Trojan detection solutions. We investigate SoC vulnerabilities to variations of iThermTroj through an in-depth analysis of Trojan activation and duration scenarios. We also propose a set of tiny Machine Learning classifiers for run-time anomaly detection to protect SoCs against such intermittent thermal Trojan attacks. Compared to existing methods, our approach improves the attack detection rate by 29.4\%, 17.2\%, and 14.3\% in scenarios where iThermTroj manipulates up to 80\%, 60\%, and 40\% of SoC's thermal data, respectively. Additionally, our method increases the full protection resolution to 0.8 degrees Celsius, meaning that any temperature manipulations exceeding $\pm 0.8$ degrees will be detected with 100\% accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Can Local Representation Alignment RNNs Solve Temporal Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13531v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing, streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the version of the paper presented at ICCSM 2025 (July 2025 in Rome, Italy).

| **[Silent Failures in Stateless Systems: Rethinking Anomaly Detection for Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04969v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has redefined cloud application deployment by abstracting infrastructure and enabling on-demand, event-driven execution, thereby enhancing developer agility and scalability. However, maintaining consistent application performance in serverless environments remains a significant challenge. The dynamic and transient nature of serverless functions makes it difficult to distinguish between benign and anomalous behavior, which in turn undermines the effectiveness of traditional anomaly detection methods. These conventional approaches, designed for stateful and long-running services, struggle in serverless settings where executions are short-lived, functions are isolated, and observability is limited. In this first comprehensive vision paper on anomaly detection for serverless systems, we systematically explore the unique challenges posed by this paradigm, including the absence of persistent state, inconsistent monitoring granularity, and the difficulty of correlating behaviors across distributed functions. We further examine a range of threats that manifest as anomalies, from classical Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to serverless-specific threats such as Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) and cold start amplification. Building on these observations, we articulate a research agenda for next-generation detection frameworks that address the need for context-aware, multi-source data fusion, real-time, lightweight, privacy-preserving, and edge-cloud adaptive capabilities. Through the identification of key research directions and design principles, we aim to lay the foundation for the next generation of anomaly detection in cloud-native, serverless ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, IEEE CISOSE 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Dealing with Uncertainty in Contextual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04490v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target (behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD, normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive, uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in domains such as healthcare.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Anomalous Decision Discovery using Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04464v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions, leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods: noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score - outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\% on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen anomaly types.

In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework that enhances AES-128 encryption security through controlled anomaly injection and real-time anomaly detection using both statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. We simulate timing and fault-based anomalies by injecting execution delays and ciphertext perturbations during encryption, generating labeled datasets for detection model training. Two complementary detection mechanisms are developed: a threshold-based timing anomaly detector and a supervised Random Forest classifier trained on combined timing and ciphertext features. We implement and evaluate the framework on both CPU and FPGA-based SoC hardware (PYNQ-Z1), measuring performance across varying block sizes, injection rates, and core counts. Our results show that ML-based detection significantly outperforms threshold-based methods in precision and recall while maintaining real-time performance on embedded hardware. Compared to existing AES anomaly detection methods, our solution offers a low-cost, real-time, and accurate detection approach deployable on lightweight FPGA platforms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |

A custom PCB captures seven sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a new liquid or sensor is introduced.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figure | None |

However, these methods face great challenges in handling high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a Down-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and 84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.</p></details> | ACM MM25 Accepted | None |
| **[Robust Localization of Partially Fake Speech: Metrics, Models, and Out-of-Domain Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03468v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial audio deepfake localization pose unique challenges and remain underexplored compared to full-utterance spoofing detection. While recent methods report strong in-domain performance, their real-world utility remains unclear. In this analysis, we critically examine the limitations of current evaluation practices, particularly the widespread use of Equal Error Rate (EER), which often obscures generalization and deployment readiness. We propose reframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and advocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior. Specifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on the in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the LlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our reproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%) but better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This highlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to models that perform poorly in real-world scenarios. It also suggests that while deep learning models can be effective on in-domain data, they generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios, failing to detect novel synthetic samples and misclassifying unfamiliar bona fide audio. Finally, we observe that adding more bona fide or fully synthetic utterances to the training data often degrades performance, whereas adding partially fake utterances improves it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to APSIPA 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing machine learning models often rely only on a single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore, task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and security tasks. To address these gaps, we propose UniNet, a unified framework that introduces a novel multi-granular traffic representation (T-Matrix), integrating session, flow, and packet-level features to provide comprehensive contextual information. Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks. Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification, and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and improved scalability.

Unpacking the Challenges and Possibilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02125v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality, source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection, they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, their application remains constrained by rigid protocol design, limited adaptability to dynamic lab conditions, inadequate error handling, and high operational complexity. Here we introduce BioMARS (Biological Multi-Agent Robotic System), an intelligent platform that integrates LLMs, VLMs, and modular robotics to autonomously design, plan, and execute biological experiments. BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization, outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration, while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware. These results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory automation and the transformative role of language-based reasoning in biological research.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2) variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |

Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness, attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models, contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to EMNLP</p></details> | None |
| **[Continuous Wavelet Transform and Siamese Network-Based Anomaly Detection in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01999v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults, noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b) developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16 architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data. Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and semi-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing</p></details> | None |

We propose a novel decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection accuracy in complex communication environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, accepted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2025</p></details> | None |

However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-Guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class, and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability.

Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks and abnormal behaviors. To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale AI/ML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>IWQoS...</summary><p>IWQoS 2025 (Camera-Ready Version)</p></details> | None |

In the context of brain MRIs, existing CA approaches rely on supervised contrastive learning or variational autoencoders (VAEs) using both healthy and unhealthy data, but such reliance on target samples is challenging in clinical settings. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) offers an alternative by learning a reference representation of healthy anatomy without the need for target samples. Deviations from this reference distribution can indicate potential anomalies. In this context, diffusion models have been increasingly adopted in UAD due to their superior performance in image generation compared to VAEs. Nonetheless, precisely reconstructing the anatomy of the brain remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework to improve the reconstruction quality by training a self-supervised contrastive encoder on healthy images to extract meaningful anatomical features. These features are used to condition a diffusion model to reconstruct the healthy appearance of a given image, enabling interpretable anomaly localization via pixel-wise comparison. We validate our approach through a proof-of-concept on a facial image dataset and further demonstrate its effectiveness on four brain MRI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art anomaly localization performance on the NOVA benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> | None |

Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's adaptability and stability in complex network environments.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

However, ensuring trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges, from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security, and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 1 figure | None |
| **[Learning Constraints Directly from Network Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23964v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols, design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules. This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial search space. Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than 25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies, we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures | None |

The primary contributions of this study include the development of an innovative RFS-based framework that not only learns the normal behavior of the data-generating process online but also dynamically adapts to behavioral shifts to accurately identify abnormal point patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a new class of RFS-based posterior distributions, named Power Discounting Posteriors (PD), which facilitate adaptation to systematic changes in data while enabling anomaly detection of point pattern data through a novel predictive posterior density function.

However, we empirically found that three important factors can substantially impact detection performance across datasets: 1) the specific SSL strategy employed; 2) the tuning of the strategy's hyperparameters; and 3) the allocation of combination weights when using multiple strategies. Most SSL-based graph anomaly detection methods circumvent these issues by arbitrarily or selectively (i.e., guided by label information) choosing SSL strategies, hyperparameter settings, and combination weights. While an arbitrary choice may lead to subpar performance, using label information in an unsupervised setting is label information leakage and leads to severe overestimation of a method's performance. Leakage has been criticized as "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", yet many recent studies on SSL-based graph anomaly detection have been using label information to select hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose to use an internal evaluation strategy (with theoretical analysis) to select hyperparameters in SSL for unsupervised anomaly detection. We perform extensive experiments using 10 recent SSL-based graph anomaly detection algorithms on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating both the prior issues with hyperparameter selection and the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery for publication (June 2025).

In this work, we assess the applicability and utility of an AI-based model for brain aneurysm detection comparing the performance of two readers with different levels of experience (2 and 13 years). We aim to answer the following questions: 1) Do the readers improve their performance when assisted by the AI algorithm? 2) How much does the AI algorithm impact routine clinical workflow? We reuse and enlarge our open-access, Time-Of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography dataset (N=460). We use 360 subjects for training/validating our algorithm and 100 as unseen test set for the reading session. Even though our model reaches state-of-the-art results on the test set (sensitivity=74%, false positive rate=1.6), we show that neither the junior nor the senior reader significantly increase their sensitivity (p=0.59, p=1, respectively). In addition, we find that reading time for both readers is significantly higher in the "AI-assisted" setting than in the "Unassisted" (+15 seconds, on average; p=3x10^(-4) junior, p=3x10^(-5) senior). The confidence reported by the readers is unchanged across the two settings, indicating that the AI assistance does not influence the certainty of the diagnosis. Our findings highlight the importance of clinical validation of AI algorithms in a clinical setting involving radiologists. This study should serve as a reminder to the community to always examine the real-word effectiveness and workflow impact of proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the journal NeuroImage: Clinical (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2025.103835)</p></details> | None |

Recent studies have explored intelligent methods for MR diagnosis to minimize user dependence and improve accuracy. However, these approaches often fail to align with clinical workflow and may lead to suboptimal accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an automated MR diagnosis model (MReg) developed on the 4-chamber cardiac color Doppler echocardiography video (A4C-CDV). It follows comprehensive feature mining strategies to detect MR and assess its severity, considering clinical realities. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the MR diagnosis as a regression task to capture the continuity and ordinal relationships between categories. Second, we design a feature selection and amplification mechanism to imitate the sonographer's diagnostic logic for accurate MR grading. Third, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts concept, we introduce a feature summary module to extract the category-level features, enhancing the representational capacity for more accurate grading. We trained and evaluated our proposed MReg on a large in-house A4C-CDV dataset comprising 1868 cases with three graded regurgitation labels. Compared to other weakly supervised video anomaly detection and supervised classification methods, MReg demonstrated superior performance in MR diagnosis.

Recent studies predominantly utilize specific category prompts during pretraining, which can cause overfitting to the training categories and limit model generalization. To address this, we propose a method that transforms category names through multicategory name stacking to create stacked prompts, forming the basis of our StackCLIP model. Our approach introduces two key components. The Clustering-Driven Stacked Prompts (CSP) module constructs generic prompts by stacking semantically analogous categories, while utilizing multi-object textual feature fusion to amplify discriminative anomalies among similar objects. The Ensemble Feature Alignment (EFA) module trains knowledge-specific linear layers tailored for each stack cluster and adaptively integrates them based on the attributes of test categories. These modules work together to deliver superior training speed, stability, and convergence, significantly boosting anomaly segmentation performance. Additionally, our stacked prompt framework offers robust generalization across classification tasks. To further improve performance, we introduce the Regulating Prompt Learning (RPL) module, which leverages the generalization power of stacked prompts to refine prompt learning, elevating results in anomaly detection classification tasks. Extensive testing on seven industrial anomaly detection datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a combined knowledge and data driven approach, KnowSafe, for the design of safety engines that can predict and mitigate safety hazards resulting from safety-critical malicious attacks or accidental faults targeting a CPS controller. We integrate domain-specific knowledge of safety constraints and context-specific mitigation actions with machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate system trajectories in the far and near future, infer potential hazards, and generate optimal corrective actions to keep the system safe. Experimental evaluation on two realistic closed-loop testbeds for artificial pancreas systems (APS) and a real-world clinical trial dataset for diabetes treatment demonstrates that KnowSafe outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving higher accuracy in predicting system state trajectories and potential hazards, a low false positive rate, and no false negatives. It also maintains the safe operation of the simulated APS despite faults or attacks without introducing any new hazards, with a hazard mitigation success rate of 92.8%, which is at least 76% higher than solely rule-based (50.9%) and data-driven (52.7%) methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, 11 tables, to appear in the IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC'25)</p></details> | None |
| **[Reconciling Attribute and Structural Anomalies for Improved Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23469v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection is critical in domains such as healthcare and economics, where identifying deviations can prevent substantial losses. Existing unsupervised approaches strive to learn a single model capable of detecting both attribute and structural anomalies. However, they confront the tug-of-war problem between two distinct types of anomalies, resulting in suboptimal performance. This work presents TripleAD, a mutual distillation-based triple-channel graph anomaly detection framework. It includes three estimation modules to identify the attribute, structural, and mixed anomalies while mitigating the interference between different types of anomalies. In the first channel, we design a multiscale attribute estimation module to capture extensive node interactions and ameliorate the over-smoothing issue. To better identify structural anomalies, we introduce a link-enhanced structure estimation module in the second channel that facilitates information flow to topologically isolated nodes. The third channel is powered by an attribute-mixed curvature, a new indicator that encapsulates both attribute and structural information for discriminating mixed anomalies. Moreover, a mutual distillation strategy is introduced to encourage communication and collaboration between the three channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TripleAD model against strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS); DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2025.3561172</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhancing Insider Threat Detection Using User-Based Sequencing and Transformer Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23446v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insider threat detection presents unique challenges due to the authorized status of malicious actors and the subtlety of anomalous behaviors. Existing machine learning methods often treat user activity as isolated events, thereby failing to leverage sequential dependencies in user behavior. In this study, we propose a User-Based Sequencing (UBS) methodology, transforming the CERT insider threat dataset into structured temporal sequences suitable for deep sequential modeling. We deploy a Transformer Encoder architecture to model benign user activity and employ its reconstruction errors as anomaly scores. These scores are subsequently evaluated using three unsupervised outlier detection algorithms: One-Class SVM (OCSVM), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest (iForest). Across four rigorously designed test sets, including combinations of multiple CERT dataset releases, our UBS-Transformer pipeline consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance - notably 96.61% accuracy, 99.43% recall, 96.38% F1-score, 95.00% AUROC, and exceptionally low false negative (0.0057) and false positive (0.0571) rates. Comparative analyses demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms tabular and conventional autoencoder baselines, underscoring the efficacy of sequential user modeling and advanced anomaly detection in the insider threat domain.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, both database vendors and customers have increasingly turned to autonomous database platforms in an effort to alleviate the heavy workload of DBAs. However, existing autonomous database platforms are limited in their capabilities, primarily addressing single-point issues such as NL2SQL, anomaly detection, and SQL tuning. Manual intervention remains a necessity for comprehensive database maintenance. GaussMaster aims to revolutionize this landscape by introducing an LLM-based database copilot system. This innovative solution is designed not only to assist developers in writing efficient SQL queries but also to provide comprehensive care for database services. When database instances exhibit abnormal behavior, GaussMaster is capable of orchestrating the entire maintenance process automatically. It achieves this by analyzing hundreds of metrics and logs, employing a Tree-of-thought approach to identify root causes, and invoking appropriate tools to resolve issues. We have successfully implemented GaussMaster in real-world scenarios, such as the banking industry, where it has achieved zero human intervention for over 34 database maintenance scenarios. In this paper, we present significant improvements in these tasks with code at https://gitcode.com/opengauss/openGauss-GaussMaster.</p></details> | <details><summary>We we...</summary><p>We welcome contributions from the community.

| **[Autoregressive Denoising Score Matching is a Good Video Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23282v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an important computer vision problem. Thanks to the mode coverage capabilities of generative models, the likelihood-based paradigm is catching growing interest, as it can model normal distribution and detect out-of-distribution anomalies. However, these likelihood-based methods are blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned distribution. To handle these ``unseen" anomalies, we dive into three gaps uniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically, we first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score matching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function by embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and assigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input sequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate unaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score matching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting intensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the corresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original data to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an enhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context. With all three gaps considered, we can compute a more comprehensive anomaly indicator. Experiments on three popular VAD benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

Detecting and responding to threats at scale without impairing system efficiency has therefore become a critical information-management and decision-support challenge for today's executives. This paper develops a distributed, gain-based anomaly-detection framework tailored to IoT-enabled enterprise systems, underpinned by an optimized sensor-subset partitioning strategy. Starting from the perspective of set partitioning strategies, this study analyzes the key factor that contributes to the performance differences between distributed and centralized algorithms. By examining the gain mutual influence of sensor subsets, an optimal set partitioning strategy is designed to minimize inter-subset mutual influence while enhancing intra-subset correlation. To further reduce the computational cost of gain updates, a suboptimal partitioning strategy based on Grassmann distance is proposed, improving the efficiency of selecting suspicious sensors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach effectively reduces the computational cost of gain updates while maintaining detection performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing attack detection performance.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Kernel Outlier Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22994v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new anomaly detection method called kernel outlier detection (KOD) is proposed. It is designed to address challenges of outlier detection in high-dimensional settings. The aim is to overcome limitations of existing methods, such as dependence on distributional assumptions or on hyperparameters that are hard to tune. KOD starts with a kernel transformation, followed by a projection pursuit approach. Its novelties include a new ensemble of directions to search over, and a new way to combine results of different direction types. This provides a flexible and lightweight approach for outlier detection. Our empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of KOD on three small datasets with challenging structures, and on four large benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position, speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns. First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors. Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 265.63. These results demonstrate the models' effectiveness in accurately predicting vehicle trajectories and detecting anomalies in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data. The complete TSQA dataset, models, user study questionnaires for evaluation, and other related materials have been open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025, Main)</p></details> | None |

This architecture has demonstrated success in time series forecasting, lossless compression, and even large-scale language modeling tasks, where its linear memory footprint and fast inference make it a viable alternative to Transformers. Despite its growing popularity, no prior work has explored xLSTM for anomaly detection. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing xLSTMAD, the first anomaly detection method that integrates a full encoder-decoder xLSTM architecture, purpose-built for multivariate time series data. Our encoder processes input sequences to capture historical context, while the decoder is devised in two separate variants of the method. In the forecasting approach, the decoder iteratively generates forecasted future values xLSTMAD-F, while the reconstruction approach reconstructs the input time series from its encoded counterpart xLSTMAD-R. We investigate the performance of two loss functions: Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Soft Dynamic Time Warping (SoftDTW) to consider local reconstruction fidelity and global sequence alignment, respectively. We evaluate our method on the comprehensive TSB-AD-M benchmark, which spans 17 real-world datasets, using state-of-the-art challenging metrics such as VUS-PR. In our results, xLSTM showcases state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming 23 popular anomaly detection baselines. Our paper is the first work revealing the powerful modeling capabilities of xLSTM for anomaly detection, paving the way for exciting new developments on this subject.

However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making Privacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. Additionally, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future opportunities from the perspectives of AI development and P2VAD deployment, aiming to guide future work in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

While existing surveys typically focus on isolated aspects of TSS, a comprehensive analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, particularly considering emerging technologies, remains lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of vision technologies in TSS, examining both low-level perception tasks (object detection, classification, and tracking) and high-level perception tasks (parameter estimation, anomaly detection, and behavior understanding). Specifically, we first provide a detailed methodological categorization and comprehensive performance evaluation for each task. Our investigation reveals five fundamental limitations in current TSS: perceptual data degradation in complex scenarios, data-driven learning constraints, semantic understanding gaps, sensing coverage limitations and computational resource demands. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze five categories of current approaches and potential trends: advanced perception enhancement, efficient learning paradigms, knowledge-enhanced understanding, cooperative sensing frameworks and efficient computing frameworks, critically assessing their real-world applicability. Furthermore, we evaluate the transformative potential of foundation models in TSS, which exhibit remarkable zero-shot learning abilities, strong generalization, and sophisticated reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks. This review provides a unified analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, systematically analyzes current limitations and solutions, and presents a structured roadmap for integrating emerging technologies, particularly foundation models, to enhance TSS capabilities.</p></details> |  | None |

As the patterns of anormal samples are usually not known a priori, this task is highly challenging. Consequently, anomaly detection lies between semi- and unsupervised learning. The detection of anomalies in sound data, often called 'ASD' (Anomalous Sound Detection), is a sub-field that deals with the identification of new and yet unknown effects in acoustic recordings. It is of great importance for various applications in Industry 4.0. Here, vibrational or acoustic data are typically obtained from standard sensor signals used for predictive maintenance. Examples cover machine condition monitoring or quality assurance to track the state of components or products. However, the use of intelligent algorithms remains a controversial topic. Management generally aims for cost-reduction and automation, while quality and maintenance experts emphasize the need for human expertise and comprehensible solutions. In this work, we present an anomaly detection approach specifically designed for spectrograms. The approach is based on statistical evaluations and is theoretically motivated. In addition, it features intrinsic explainability, making it particularly suitable for applications in industrial settings. Thus, this algorithm is of relevance for applications in which black-box algorithms are unwanted or unsuitable.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets, underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.</p></details> |  | None |

In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points) for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each type.

| **[Learning to Be a Transformer to Pinpoint Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04092v3)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently deploy strong, often pre-trained feature extractors, recent Industrial Anomaly Detection and Segmentation (IADS) methods process low-resolution images, e.g., 224x224 pixels, obtained by downsampling the original input images. However, while numerous industrial applications demand the identification of both large and small defects, downsampling the input image to a low resolution may hinder a method's ability to pinpoint tiny anomalies. We propose a novel Teacher--Student paradigm to leverage strong pre-trained features while processing high-resolution input images very efficiently. The core idea concerns training two shallow MLPs (the Students) by nominal images so as to mimic the mappings between the patch embeddings induced by the self-attention layers of a frozen vision Transformer (the Teacher). Indeed, learning these mappings sets forth a challenging pretext task that small-capacity models are unlikely to accomplish on out-of-distribution data such as anomalous images. Our method can spot anomalies from high-resolution images and runs way faster than competitors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD and the best segmentation results on VisA. We also propose novel evaluation metrics to capture robustness to defect size, i.e., the ability to preserve good localisation from large anomalies to tiny ones. Evaluating our method also by these metrics reveals its neatly superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

However, the manual modeling of faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the development of digital twins for industrial environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2) anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression. For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our approach under 1/2/4-shots.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 7figures, 6tables</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and struggle to capture temporal and structural dependencies in transaction networks. This paper proposes an Augmented Temporal-aware Graph Attention Network (ATGAT) that enhances detection performance through three modules: (1) designing an advanced temporal embedding module that fuses multi-scale time difference features with periodic position encoding; (2) constructing a temporal-aware triple attention mechanism that jointly optimizes structural, temporal, and global context attention; (3) employing weighted BCE loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Elliptic++ cryptocurrency dataset demonstrate that ATGAT achieves an AUC of 0.9130, representing a 9.2% improvement over the best traditional method XGBoost, 12.0% over GCN, and 10.0% over standard GAT. This method not only validates the enhancement effect of temporal awareness and triple attention mechanisms on graph neural networks, but also provides financial institutions with more reliable fraud detection tools, with its design principles generalizable to other temporal graph anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Generative Adversarial Evasion and Out-of-Distribution Detection for UAV Cyber-Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21142v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples; however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate. Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI), man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.</p></details> |  | None |

Here, we introduce E-ABIN, a general-purpose, explainable framework for Anomaly detection in Biological Networks. E-ABIN combines classical machine learning and graph-based deep learning techniques within a unified, user-friendly platform, enabling the detection and interpretation of anomalies from gene expression or methylation-derived networks. By integrating algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Graph Autoencoders (GAEs), and Graph Adversarial Attributed Networks (GAANs), E-ABIN ensures a high predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability. We demonstrate the utility of E-ABIN through case studies of bladder cancer and coeliac disease, where it effectively uncovers biologically relevant anomalies and offers insights into disease mechanisms.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for CVPR 2025 NFBCC workshop</p></details> | None |

Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we investigate transformer-based approaches for time series anomaly detection, focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss appropriate evaluation metrics for such labels; (iii) we study the impact of anomalous data present during training and assess the effectiveness of alternative loss functions in mitigating their influence; and (iv) we present a comprehensive comparison of several transformer-based models across a diverse set of datasets for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to VLDB 2026 conference, currently under review</p></details> | None |
| **[TSPulse: Dual Space Tiny Pre-Trained Models for Rapid Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13033v2)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters (10-100X smaller than existing SOTA models) and allow GPU-free inference, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models.

It is widely recognized that achieving human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge, exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex, cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, under review of NeurIPS</p></details> | None |

Current search frameworks find an enormity of false-positive signals, especially in large surveys, requiring manual follow-up to a sometimes prohibitive degree. Unsupervised learning provides an algorithmic way to winnow the most anomalous signals from the chaff, as well as group together RFI signals that bear morphological similarities. We present GLOBULAR (Grouping Low-frequency Observations By Unsupervised Learning After Reduction) clustering, a signal processing method that uses HDBSCAN to reduce the false-positive rate and isolate outlier signals for further analysis. When combined with a standard narrowband signal detection and spatial filtering pipeline, such as turboSETI, GLOBULAR clustering offers significant improvements in the false-positive rate over the standard pipeline alone, suggesting dramatic potential for the amelioration of manual follow-up requirements for future large surveys. By removing RFI signals in regions of high spectral occupancy, GLOBULAR clustering may also enable the detection of signals missed by the standard pipeline. We benchmark our method against the Choza et al. turboSETI-only search of 97 nearby galaxies at the L band, demonstrating a false-positive hit reduction rate of 93.1% and a false-positive event reduction rate of 99.3%.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures | None |

Applications span clustering, anomaly detection, and beyond. In this work, we present a unified framework grounded in mathematical optimization to address matrix seriation from a rigorous, model-based perspective. Our approach leverages combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization to represent seriation objectives and constraints with high fidelity, bridging the gap between traditional heuristic methods and exact solution techniques. We introduce new mathematical programming models for neighborhood-based stress criteria, including nonlinear formulations and their linearized counterparts. For structured settings such as Moore and von Neumann neighborhoods, we develop a novel Hamiltonian path-based reformulation that enables effective control over spatial arrangement and interpretability in the reordered matrix. To assess the practical impact of our models, we carry out an extensive set of experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as on a newly curated benchmark based on a coauthorship network from the matrix seriation literature. Our results show that these optimization-based formulations not only enhance solution quality and interpretability but also provide a versatile foundation for extending matrix seriation to new domains in data science.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 20 figures, 8 tables.

Current unsupervised or weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained only on healthy data. While these approaches reduce annotation dependency, GAN-based methods are notably more challenging to train than non-GAN alternatives (such as autoencoders) due to issues such as the simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, and training instability. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised $\textbf{I}$mplicitly-$\textbf{g}$uided $\textbf{CO}$u$\textbf{N}$terfactual diffusion model for $\textbf{D}$etecting $\textbf{A}$nomalies in $\textbf{PET}$ images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases (multi-cancer, multi-tracer) containing both local and public datasets (spanning multiple centers). The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUV$_\text{max}$ thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies.

While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors. Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, accepted at IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Behavioral Anomaly Detection in Distributed Systems via Federated Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19246v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space. Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in distributed systems.</p></details> |  | None |

In digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images, such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over 20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for digital pathology images.</p></details> |  | None |

However, even high-performing models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across the dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation through user studies with two models and three time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD, which fosters a deeper model understanding, immediate corrective actions, and model reliability enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is currently under review</p></details> | None |

Our results show that supervised MLP and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best, demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios.

In robotic manipulation, failures typically arise from (1) robot-driven anomalies due to an insufficient task model or hardware limitations, and (2) environment-driven anomalies caused by dynamic environmental changes or external interferences. Conventional anomaly detection methods focus either on the first by low-level statistical modeling of proprioceptive signals or the second by deep learning-based visual environment observation, each with different computational and training data requirements. To effectively capture anomalies from both sources, we propose a mixture-of-experts framework that integrates the complementary detection mechanisms with a visual-language model for environment monitoring and a Gaussian-mixture regression-based detector for tracking deviations in interaction forces and robot motions. We introduce a confidence-based fusion mechanism that dynamically selects the most reliable detector for each situation. We evaluate our approach on both household and industrial tasks using two robotic systems, demonstrating a 60% reduction in detection delay while improving frame-wise anomaly detection performance compared to individual detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, the paper has been accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

While deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used for LAD, traditional machine learning (ML) techniques can also perform well depending on the context and dataset. Semi-supervised techniques deserve the same attention as they offer practical advantages over fully supervised methods. Current evaluations mainly focus on detection accuracy, but this alone is insufficient to determine the suitability of a technique for a given LAD task. Other aspects to consider include training and prediction times as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, which in practice matters to engineers. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating a wide range of supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques across four criteria: detection accuracy, time performance, and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning in both detection accuracy and time performance. The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML techniques fare similarly in terms of their detection accuracy and prediction time on most of the benchmark datasets considered in our study. Moreover, overall, sensitivity analysis to hyperparameter tuning with respect to detection accuracy shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive than deep learning techniques. Further, semi-supervised techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised techniques.</p></details> | Accepted by EMSE'25 | None |
| **[Trustworthy Prediction with Gaussian Process Knowledge Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18630v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic models are often used to make predictions in regions of the data space where no observations are available, but it is not always clear whether such predictions are well-informed by previously seen data. In this paper, we propose a knowledge score for predictions from Gaussian process regression (GPR) models that quantifies the extent to which observing data have reduced our uncertainty about a prediction. The knowledge score is interpretable and naturally bounded between 0 and 1. We demonstrate in several experiments that the knowledge score can anticipate when predictions from a GPR model are accurate, and that this anticipation improves performance in tasks such as anomaly detection, extrapolation, and missing data imputation.

| **[Normality Prior Guided Multi-Semantic Fusion Network for Unsupervised Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18544v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns. Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks. This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC.

In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

This project proposes to solve that by developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal disorders in under-resourced areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures.

By considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary dynamics.</p></details> | 42 pages, 16 figures | None |

With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD.

| **[Weak Signals and Heavy Tails: Machine-learning meets Extreme Value Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06984v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The masses of data now available have opened up the prospect of discovering weak signals using machine-learning algorithms, with a view to predictive or interpretation tasks. As this survey of recent results attempts to show, bringing multivariate extreme value theory and statistical learning theory together in a common, non-parametric and non-asymptotic framework makes it possible to design and analyze new methods for exploiting the scarce information located in distribution tails in these purposes. This article reviews recently proved theoretical tools for establishing guarantees for supervised or unsupervised algorithms learning from a fraction of extreme data. These are mainly exponential maximal deviation inequalities tailored to low-probability regions and concentration results for stochastic processes empirically describing the behavior of extreme observations, their dependence structure in particular. Under appropriate assumptions of regular variation, several illustrative applications are then examined: classification, regression, anomaly detection, model selection via cross-validation. For these, generalization results are established inspired by the classical bounds in statistical learning theory. In the same spirit, it is also shown how to adapt the popular high-dimensional lasso technique in the context of extreme values for the covariates with generalization guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>chang...</summary><p>changes in latest version: Prop. 4.1 minor edit ; Section 5 re-organized for clarity with some changes in content</p></details> | None |

Offloading ML to programmable data plane (PDP) enables quick analysis and responses to network traffic dynamics, and efficient management of network links. However, PDP hardware pipeline has significant resource limitations. For instance, Intel Tofino ASIC has only 10Mb SRAM in each stage, and lacks support for multiplication, division and floating-point operations. These constraints significantly hinder the development of IDP. This paper presents \quark, a framework that fully offloads convolutional neural network (CNN) inference onto PDP. \quark employs model pruning to simplify the CNN model, and uses quantization to support floating-point operations. Additionally, \quark divides the CNN into smaller units to improve resource utilization on the PDP. We have implemented a testbed prototype of \quark on both P4 hardware switch (Intel Tofino ASIC) and software switch (i.e., BMv2). Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that \quark achieves 97.3\% accuracy in anomaly detection task while using only 22.7\% of the SRAM resources on the Intel Tofino ASIC switch, completing inference tasks at line rate with an average latency of 42.66$\mu s$.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), 2025</p></details> | None |

However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoder model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments.

Supply chains are inherently graph-like, making them ideal for GNN methodologies, which can optimize and solve complex problems. The barriers include a lack of proper conceptual foundations, familiarity with graph applications in SCM, and real-world benchmark datasets for GNN-based supply chain research. To address this, we discuss and connect supply chains with graph structures for effective GNN application, providing detailed formulations, examples, mathematical definitions, and task guidelines. Additionally, we present a multi-perspective real-world benchmark dataset from a leading FMCG company in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning. We discuss various supply chain tasks using GNNs and benchmark several state-of-the-art models on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs across six supply chain analytics tasks. Our analysis shows that GNN-based models consistently outperform statistical Machine Learning and other Deep Learning models by around 10-30% in regression, 10-30% in classification and detection tasks, and 15-40% in anomaly detection tasks on designated metrics. With this work, we lay the groundwork for solving supply chain problems using GNNs, supported by conceptual discussions, methodological insights, and a comprehensive dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.15299</p></details> | None |

Detection of anomalous or malicious data, or Anomaly Detection (AD), with machine learning is one of many vital components of cyberphysical security. Quantum kernel-based machine learning methods have shown promise in identifying complex anomalous behavior by leveraging the highly expressive and efficient feature spaces of quantum computing. This study focuses on the parameterization of Quantum Hybrid Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) using three popular datasets from Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The results demonstrate that QSVMs outperform traditional classical kernel methods, achieving 13.3% higher F1 scores. Additionally, this research investigates noise using simulations based on real IBMQ hardware, revealing a maximum error of only 0.98% in the QSVM kernels. This error results in an average reduction of 1.57% in classification metrics. Furthermore, the study found that QSVMs show a 91.023% improvement in kernel-target alignment compared to classical methods, indicating a potential "quantum advantage" in anomaly detection for critical infrastructures. This effort suggests that QSVMs can provide a substantial advantage in anomaly detection for ICS, ultimately enhancing the security and integrity of critical infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 tables, 10 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[The Blind Spot of BGP Anomaly Detection: Why LSTM Autoencoders Fail on Real-World Outages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17821v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significant potential to make the Internet's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) secure by detecting anomalous routing activity. However, all but a few of these approaches rely on the implicit assumption that anomalies manifest as noisy, high-complexity outliers from some normal baseline. This work challenges this assumption by investigating if a best-in-class detection model built on this assumption can effectively deal with real-world security events' diverse signatures. We employ an LSTM-based autoencoder, a classical example of a reconstruction-based anomaly detector, as our test vehicle. We then contrast this model with a representative sampling of historical BGP anomalies, including the Slammer worm and the Moscow blackout, and with a simulated 'BGP storm' designed as a positive control. Our experience unveils a blind spot of our model: the model easily identifies the synthetic anomaly of high complexity but invariably fails to identify real-world events that manifest in the form of a "signal loss" (e.g., Slammer, Moscow Blackout) or "low-deviation" (e.g., WannaCry) signature. We demonstrate that the model mistakenly recognizes the abrupt cut-off of BGP updates during catastrophic failures as a signal of extreme stability, leading to reconstruction errors of virtually zero and total failure to detect. We conclude that the characterization of BGP anomalies as high-reconstruction-error events alone is a weak and dangerous oversimplification. Our research provides the data-driven case for why hybrid, multi-modal detection systems capable of identifying both high-complexity and signal-loss signatures are required to enable end-to-end BGP security.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving, prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving millisecond-level real-time performance.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Spotlight | None |
| **[Searching for a Hidden Markov Anomaly over Multiple Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17108v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of detecting an anomalous process among a large number of processes. At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal state), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state) or state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition between states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over time. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of processes. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden state, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal distribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search strategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error probability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d. observations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a hidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly Detection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the probing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive belief updates over hidden states. ADHM effectively leverages temporal correlations to focus sensing resources on the most informative processes. The algorithm is supported by an asymptotic theoretical foundation, grounded in an oracle analysis that characterizes the fundamental limits of detection under the assumption of a known distribution of the hidden states. In addition, the algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in extensive simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[MAWIFlow Benchmark: Realistic Flow-Based Evaluation for Network Intrusion Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17041v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1 dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011, 2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic. To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and reproducibility.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> | None |

Learning similarities among multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures.

| **[Robust Group Anomaly Detection for Quasi-Periodic Network Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16815v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model (seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical results to substantiate our theoretical claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> | None |
| **[Open-Set Graph Anomaly Detection via Normal Structure Regularisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06835v5)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers an important Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) task, namely open-set GAD, which aims to train a detection model using a small number of normal and anomaly nodes (referred to as seen anomalies) to detect both seen anomalies and unseen anomalies (i.e., anomalies that cannot be illustrated the training anomalies). Those labelled training data provide crucial prior knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced detection errors. However, current supervised GAD methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to many errors of detecting the unseen anomalies as normal nodes. Further, existing open-set AD models were introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture discriminative features from graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely normal structure regularisation (NSReg), to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids over-fitting the seen anomalies and learns a better normality decision boundary, largely reducing the false negatives of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive empirical results on seven real-world datasets show that NSReg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 14% AUC-ROC on the unseen anomaly classes and by 10% AUC-ROC on all anomaly classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> | None |

This article presents a federated learning-based intrusion detection framework called AndroIDS that leverages system call traces as a personalized and privacy-preserving data source. Unlike conventional centralized approaches, the proposed method enables collaborative anomaly detection without sharing raw data, thus preserving user privacy across distributed nodes. A generalized system call dataset was generated to reflect realistic android system behavior and serves as the foundation for experimentation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the FL model under both IID and non-IID conditions, achieving an accuracy of 96.46 % and 92.87 %, and F1-scores of 89 % and 86 %, respectively. These results highlight the models robustness to data heterogeneity, with only a minor performance drop in the non-IID case. Further, a detailed comparison with centralized deep learning further illustrates trade-offs in detection performance and deployment feasibility. Overall, the results validate the practical applicability of the proposed approach for secure and scalable intrusion detection in real-world mobile IoT scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

As more and more organizations migrate or deploy their businesses to the cloud, a multitude of related cybersecurity incidents such as data breaches are on the rise. Many inherent attributes of cloud environments, for example, data sharing, remote access, dynamicity and scalability, pose significant challenges for the protection of cloud security. Even worse, cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and covert. Attack methods, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), are continually developed to bypass traditional security measures. Among the emerging technologies for robust threat detection, system provenance analysis is being considered as a promising mechanism, thus attracting widespread attention in the field of incident response. This paper proposes a new few-shot learning-based attack detection with improved data context intelligence. We collect operating system behavior data of cloud systems during realistic attacks and leverage an innovative semiotics extraction method to describe system events. Inspired by the advances in semantic analysis, which is a fruitful area focused on understanding natural languages in computational linguistics, we further convert the anomaly detection problem into a similarity comparison problem. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed approach is able to generalize over unseen attacks and make accurate predictions, even if the incident detection models are trained with very limited samples.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting its strong generalization ability.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust and real-time anomaly detection.

Such changes may occur due to expected shifts in the data distribution, i.e., concept drift, or unexpected anomalous changes. The presence of concept drift poses challenges for anomaly detection in time series. While anomalies are caused by undesirable changes in the data, differentiating abnormal changes from varying normal behaviours is difficult due to differing frequencies of occurrence, varying time intervals when normal patterns occur. Differentiating between concept drift and anomalies is critical for accurate analysis as studies have shown that the compounding effects of error propagation in downstream data analysis tasks lead to lower detection accuracy and increased overhead due to unnecessary model updates. Unfortunately, existing work has largely explored anomaly detection and concept drift detection in isolation. We develop AnDri, a system for Anomaly detection in the presence of Drift, which adjusts the normal patterns temporally, and distinguish abnormal subsequences and new concepts. Moreover, it introduces a new clustering method, Adjacent Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), which groups similar subsequences while respecting their temporal locality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (to be updated)</p></details> | None |

Meanwhile, several other problems are closely related to OOD detection, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD). To unify these problems, a generalized OOD detection framework was proposed, taxonomically categorizing these five problems. However, Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have significantly changed the paradigm and blurred the boundaries between these fields, again confusing researchers. In this survey, we first present a generalized OOD detection v2, encapsulating the evolution of these fields in the VLM era. Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD. Then, we highlight the significant shift in the definition, problem settings, and benchmarks; we thus feature a comprehensive review of the methodology for OOD detection and related tasks to clarify their relationship to OOD detection.

Deep learning approaches, graph neural networks (GNNs) in particular, have been emerging as a promising paradigm for GAD, owing to its strong capability in capturing complex structure and/or node attributes in graph data. Considering the large number of methods proposed for GNN-based GAD, it is of paramount importance to summarize the methodologies and findings in the existing GAD studies, so that we can pinpoint effective model designs for tackling open GAD problems. To this end, in this work we aim to present a comprehensive review of deep learning approaches for GAD. Existing GAD surveys are focused on task-specific discussions, making it difficult to understand the technical insights of existing methods and their limitations in addressing some unique challenges in GAD. To fill this gap, we first discuss the problem complexities and their resulting challenges in GAD, and then provide a systematic review of current deep GAD methods from three novel perspectives of methodology, including GNN backbone design, proxy task design for GAD, and graph anomaly measures. To deepen the discussions, we further propose a taxonomy of 13 fine-grained method categories under these three perspectives to provide more in-depth insights into the model designs and their capabilities. To facilitate the experiments and validation, we also summarize a collection of widely-used GAD datasets and empirical comparison.

| **[Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Robust Homophily Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15448v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

| **[A Semi-Supervised Approach for Abnormal Event Prediction on Large Operational Network Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07660v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large network logs, recording multivariate time series generated from heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on multivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic). Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training data scarcity. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for event detection on a large real-world network log.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE BigData2022</p></details> | None |

Meanwhile, deep learning has enabled precise segmentation of 3D medical images using tools like nnUNet. However, the scarcity of labeled data in ONJ imaging makes supervised training impractical. This study aims to develop an unsupervised training approach for automatically identifying anomalies in imaging scans. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline. In the first stage, a VQ-GAN is trained to accurately reconstruct normal subjects. In the second stage, random cube masking and ONJ-specific masking are applied to train a new encoder capable of recovering the data. The proposed method achieves successful segmentation on both simulated and real patient data. This approach provides a fast initial segmentation solution, reducing the burden of manual labeling. Additionally, it has the potential to be directly used for 3D printing when combined with hand-tuned post-processing.</p></details> |  | None |

In the unsupervised setting, an effective and theoretically-grounded principle is to train classifiers to distinguish normal data from (synthetic) anomalies. We extend this principle to semi-supervised AD, where training data also include a limited labeled subset of anomalies possibly present in test time. We propose a theoretically-grounded and empirically effective framework for semi-supervised AD that combines known and synthetic anomalies during training. To analyze semi-supervised AD, we introduce the first mathematical formulation of semi-supervised AD, which generalizes unsupervised AD. Here, we show that synthetic anomalies enable (i) better anomaly modeling in low-density regions and (ii) optimal convergence guarantees for neural network classifiers -- the first theoretical result for semi-supervised AD. We empirically validate our framework on five diverse benchmarks, observing consistent performance gains. These improvements also extend beyond our theoretical framework to other classification-based AD methods, validating the generalizability of the synthetic anomaly principle in AD.</p></details> |  | None |

The number of information security events generated by information security tools grows up with the development of the IT infrastructure. At the same time, the cyber threat landscape does not remain constant, and monitoring should take into account both already known attack indicators and those for which there are no signature rules in information security products of various classes yet. Detecting anomalies in large cybersecurity data streams is a complex task that, if properly addressed, can allow for timely response to atypical and previously unknown cyber threats. The possibilities of using of offline algorithms may be limited for a number of reasons related to the time of training and the frequency of retraining. Using stream learning algorithms for solving this task is capable of providing near-real-time data processing. This article examines the results of ten algorithms from three Python stream machine-learning libraries on BETH dataset with cybersecurity events, which contains information about the creation, cloning, and destruction of operating system processes collected using extended eBPF. ROC-AUC metric and total processing time of processing with these algorithms are presented. Several combinations of features and the order of events are considered.

This model enables automated detection of anomalies at a fine-grained level within steel scrap. Specifically, we finetune the image encoder, equipped with multi-scale mechanism and text prompts aligned with both normal and anomaly images.

However, increasing the number of prototypes may lead to anomalies being well reconstructed through the attention mechanism, which we refer to as the "Soft Identity Mapping" problem. In this paper, we propose Pro-AD to address these issues and fully utilize the prototypes to boost the performance of anomaly detection. Specifically, we first introduce an expanded set of learnable prototypes to provide sufficient capacity for semantic information. Then we employ a Dynamic Bidirectional Decoder which integrates the process of the normal information aggregation and the target feature reconstruction via prototypes, with the aim of allowing the prototypes to aggregate more comprehensive normal semantic information from different levels of the image features and the target feature reconstruction to not only utilize its contextual information but also dynamically leverage the learned comprehensive prototypes. Additionally, to prevent the anomalies from being well reconstructed using sufficient semantic information through the attention mechanism, Pro-AD introduces a Prototype-based Constraint that applied within the target feature reconstruction process of the decoder, which further improves the performance of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our Pro-AD achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its superior robustness and practical effectiveness for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a significant challenge arises due to the absence of dense frame-level annotations, often leading to incomplete localization in existing WS-VAD methods. To address this issue, we present a novel LEC-VAD, Learning Event Completeness for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection, which features a dual structure designed to encode both category-aware and category-agnostic semantics between vision and language. Within LEC-VAD, we devise semantic regularities that leverage an anomaly-aware Gaussian mixture to learn precise event boundaries, thereby yielding more complete event instances. Besides, we develop a novel memory bank-based prototype learning mechanism to enrich concise text descriptions associated with anomaly-event categories. This innovation bolsters the text's expressiveness, which is crucial for advancing WS-VAD. Our LEC-VAD demonstrates remarkable advancements over the current state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets XD-Violence and UCF-Crime.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML | None |

This study introduces an advanced, scalable machine learning framework for condition monitoring of wind turbines, specifically targeting improved detection of anomalies using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. The framework effectively isolates normal turbine behavior through rigorous preprocessing, incorporating domain-specific rules and anomaly detection filters, including Gaussian Mixture Models and a predictive power score. The data cleaning and feature selection process enables identification of deviations indicative of performance degradation, facilitating estimates of annual energy production losses. The data preprocessing methods resulted in significant data reduction, retaining on average 31% of the original SCADA data per wind farm. Notably, 24 out of 35 turbines exhibited clear performance declines. At the same time, seven improved, and four showed no significant changes when employing the power curve feature set, which consisted of wind speed and ambient temperature. Models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN consistently captured subtle but persistent declines in turbine performance. The developed framework provides a novel approach to existing condition monitoring methodologies by isolating normal operational data and estimating annual energy loss, which can be a key part in reducing maintenance expenditures and mitigating economic impacts from turbine downtime.</p></details> |  | None |

The approach integrates a physics-inspired simulator that captures nonlinear growth-relaxation dynamics with random perturbations, representative of many complex physical, industrial, and cyber-physical systems. We use CNN-LSTM architectures for spatio-temporal feature extraction, Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly scoring, and Isolation Forests for residual-based outlier detection in addition to a Dual-Stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) for one-step forecasting on top of the generated simulation data. To create composite anomaly forecasts, these models are combined using a meta-learner that combines forecasting outputs, reconstruction errors, and residual scores. The hybrid ensemble performs better than standalone models in anomaly localization, generalization, and robustness to nonlinear deviations, according to simulation-based experiments. The framework provides a broad, data-driven approach to early defect identification and predictive monitoring in nonlinear systems, which may be applied to a variety of scenarios where complete physical models might not be accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 5 algorithms</p></details> | None |

Existing VAD benchmarks, however, are primarily designed for general-purpose scenarios, neglecting the specific characteristics of smart home applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce SmartHome-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating VAD in smart home scenarios, focusing on the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> | None |

Current learning-based methods attempt to leverage ``more" information from both the spatial and the short-term temporal domains, but suffer from unreliable performance under complex conditions while incurring computational redundancy. In this paper, we explore the ``more essential" information from a more crucial domain for the detection. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal that the global temporal saliency and correlation information in the temporal profile demonstrate significant superiority in distinguishing target signals from other signals. To investigate whether such superiority is preferentially leveraged by well-trained networks, we built the first prediction attribution tool in this field and verified the importance of the temporal profile information. Inspired by the above conclusions, we remodel the IRST detection task as a one-dimensional signal anomaly detection task, and propose an efficient deep temporal probe network (DeepPro) that only performs calculations in the time dimension for IRST detection. We conducted extensive experiments to fully validate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results are exciting, as our DeepPro outperforms existing state-of-the-art IRST detection methods on widely-used benchmarks with extremely high efficiency, and achieves a significant improvement on dim targets and in complex scenarios. We provide a new modeling domain, a new insight, a new method, and a new performance, which can promote the development of IRST detection.

The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively.

Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and text; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains under-explored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a model-agnostic data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. By leveraging influence scores, TimeInf attributes model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures between the time points. Our empirical results show that TimeInf effectively detects time series anomalies and outperforms existing data attribution techniques as well as state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Moreover, TimeInf offers interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to distinguish diverse anomalous patterns through visualizations. We also showcase a potential application of TimeInf in identifying mislabeled anomalies in the ground truth annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

The Hamiltonian incorporates Ising interactions within each layer and site-wise emission couplings between layers, extending hidden Markov models to a bilayer Markov random field. Specifically, we explore translation-invariant Gibbs measures (TIGM) of this Hamiltonian on Cayley trees. Under certain explicit conditions on the model's parameters, we demonstrate that there can be up to three distinct TIGMs. Each of these measures represents an equilibrium state of the spin system. These measures provide a structured approach to inference on hierarchical data in machine learning.

While time series cross-validation (TSCV) techniques aim to preserve temporal ordering during model evaluation, their impact on classifier performance remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates the effect of TSCV strategy on the precision-recall characteristics of classifiers trained to detect fault-like anomalies in MTS datasets. We compare walk-forward (WF) and sliding window (SW) methods across a range of validation partition configurations and classifier types, including shallow learners and deep learning (DL) classifiers. Results show that SW consistently yields higher median AUC-PR scores and reduced fold-to-fold performance variance, particularly for deep architectures sensitive to localized temporal continuity. Furthermore, we find that classifier generalization is sensitive to the number and structure of temporal partitions, with overlapping windows preserving fault signatures more effectively at lower fold counts. A classifier-level stratified analysis reveals that certain algorithms, such as random forests (RF), maintain stable performance across validation schemes, whereas others exhibit marked sensitivity. This study demonstrates that TSCV design in benchmarking anomaly detection models on streaming time series and provide guidance for selecting evaluation strategies in temporally structured learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation transfer.</p></details> |  | None |

As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification.

| **[Deep Symmetric Autoencoders from the Eckart-Young-Schmidt Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11641v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance, we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the importance of model design and initialization.</p></details> | 28 pages, 10 figures | None |

This challenge is evident in applications such as multi-view and multi-class scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD, a efficient autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model employs a technique that enhances feature diversity, thereby increasing the effective capacity of the network. It also utilizes large kernel convolution to extract highly abstract patterns, which contribute to efficient and compact feature embedding. Moreover, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Hard Mining Loss (ADCLoss), specifically tailored to FRADs. In our methodology, any dataset can be unified under the framework of feature-rich anomaly detection, in a way that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Our approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance in multiple challenging benchmarks.

| **[Prioritizing Alignment Paradigms over Task-Specific Model Customization in Time-Series LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11512v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications, including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain, characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm. Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms and outline promising research directions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[IQE-CLIP: Instance-aware Query Embedding for Zero-/Few-shot Anomaly Detection in Medical Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10730v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks. However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP/}{this https URL}.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/hongh0/IQE-CLIP) |
| **[Anomaly Detection for Sensing Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10718v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various approaches in the field of physical layer security involve anomaly detection, such as physical layer authentication, sensing attacks, and anti-tampering solutions. Depending on the context in which these approaches are applied, anomaly detection needs to be computationally lightweight, resilient to changes in temperature and environment, and robust against phase noise. We adapt moving average filters, autoregression filters and Kalman filters to provide predictions of feature vectors that fulfill the above criteria. Different hypothesis test designs are employed that allow omnidirectional and unidirectional outlier detection. In a case study, a sensing attack is investigated that employs the described algorithms with various channel features based on commodity WiFi devices. Thereby, various combinations of algorithms and channel features show effectiveness for motion detection by an attacker. Countermeasures only utilizing transmit power randomization are shown insufficient to mitigate such attacks if the attacker has access to channel state information (CSI) measurements, suggesting that mitigation solutions might require frequency-variant randomization.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Data Driven Diagnosis for Large Cyber-Physical-Systems with Minimal Prior Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10613v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that leverages minimal causal relationship information between subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical systems where limited prior knowledge is available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MADCluster: Model-agnostic Anomaly Detection with Self-supervised Clustering Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16223v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures | None |

This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation, medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization, particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world 3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance. Our dataset and code, aiming to catalyze multimodal medical AI research and establish a robust foundation for 3D medical visual understanding, are publicly available at https://github.com/Tang-xiaoxiao/M3D-RAD.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/Tang-xiaoxiao/M3D-RAD) |
| **[Conditional diffusion models for guided anomaly detection in brain images using fluid-driven anomaly randomization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10233v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases. Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images. To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology, using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion; and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TrioXpert: An automated incident management framework for microservice system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10043v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated incident management plays a pivotal role in large-scale microservice systems. However, many existing methods rely solely on single-modal data (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) and struggle to simultaneously address multiple downstream tasks, including anomaly detection (AD), failure triage (FT), and root cause localization (RCL). Moreover, the lack of clear reasoning evidence in current techniques often leads to insufficient interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose TrioXpert, an end-to-end incident management framework capable of fully leveraging multimodal data. TrioXpert designs three independent data processing pipelines based on the inherent characteristics of different modalities, comprehensively characterizing the operational status of microservice systems from both numerical and textual dimensions. It employs a collaborative reasoning mechanism using large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously handle multiple tasks while providing clear reasoning evidence to ensure strong interpretability. We conducted extensive evaluations on two popular microservice system datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that TrioXpert achieves outstanding performance in AD (improving by 4.7% to 57.7%), FT (improving by 2.1% to 40.6%), and RCL (improving by 1.6% to 163.1%) tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unseen Visual Anomaly Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01078v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly detection (AD) presents significant challenges due to the scarcity of anomalous data samples. While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages excluding supplementary</p></details> | None |
| **[Anomaly Detection via Autoencoder Composite Features and NCE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01920v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection is a challenging task. Autoencoders (AEs) or generative models are often employed to model the data distribution of normal inputs and subsequently identify anomalous, out-of-distribution inputs by high reconstruction error or low likelihood, respectively. However, AEs may generalize and achieve small reconstruction errors on abnormal inputs. We propose a decoupled training approach for anomaly detection that both an AE and a likelihood model trained with noise contrastive estimation (NCE). After training the AE, NCE estimates a probability density function, to serve as the anomaly score, on the joint space of the AE's latent representation combined with features of the reconstruction quality. To further reduce the false negative rate in NCE we systematically varying the reconstruction features to augment the training and optimize the contrastive Gaussian noise distribution. Experimental assessments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach matches the performance of prevalent state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Wavelet Scattering Transform and Fourier Representation for Offline Detection of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09674v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection, WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.</p></details> |  | None |

This literature review synthesizes recent research across thirteen academic and industry sources, examining vulnerabilities such as cipher bidding-down attacks, partial encryption exposure on control/user planes, and performance trade-offs in securing O-RAN interfaces like E2 and O1. The paper surveys key cryptographic tools -- SNOW-V, AES-256, and ZUC-256 -- evaluating their throughput, side-channel resilience, and adaptability to heterogeneous slices (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC). Emphasis is placed on emerging testbeds and AI-driven controllers that facilitate dynamic orchestration, anomaly detection, and secure configuration. We conclude by outlining future research directions, including hardware offloading, cross-layer cipher adaptation, and alignment with 3GPP TS 33.501 and O-RAN Alliance security mandates, all of which point toward the need for integrated, zero-trust architectures in 6G.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure | None |
| **[Anomaly Detection and Generation with Diffusion Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09368v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |
