Automated visual inspection of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images is indispensable for minimizing equipment downtime and containing costs. Most previous research considers supervised approaches, assuming a sufficient number of anomalously labeled samples. On the contrary, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD), an emerging research domain, focuses on unsupervised learning, avoiding the costly defect collection phase while providing explanations of the predictions. We introduce a benchmark for VAD in the semiconductor domain by leveraging the MIIC dataset. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of modern VAD approaches in this field.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EAGLE: Contrastive Learning for Efficient Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07508v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection is a popular and vital task in various real-world scenarios, which has been studied for several decades. Recently, many studies extending deep learning-based methods have shown preferable performance on graph anomaly detection. However, existing methods are lack of efficiency that is definitely necessary for embedded devices. Towards this end, we propose an Efficient Anomaly detection model on heterogeneous Graphs via contrastive LEarning (EAGLE) by contrasting abnormal nodes with normal ones in terms of their distances to the local context. The proposed method first samples instance pairs on meta path-level for contrastive learning. Then, a graph autoencoder-based model is applied to learn informative node embeddings in an unsupervised way, which will be further combined with the discriminator to predict the anomaly scores of nodes. Experimental results show that EAGLE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three heterogeneous network datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Boosting Global-Local Feature Matching via Anomaly Synthesis for Multi-Class Point Cloud Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07375v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud anomaly detection is essential for various industrial applications. The huge computation and storage costs caused by the increasing product classes limit the application of single-class unsupervised methods, necessitating the development of multi-class unsupervised methods. However, the feature similarity between normal and anomalous points from different class data leads to the feature confusion problem, which greatly hinders the performance of multi-class methods. Therefore, we introduce a multi-class point cloud anomaly detection method, named GLFM, leveraging global-local feature matching to progressively separate data that are prone to confusion across multiple classes. Specifically, GLFM is structured into three stages: Stage-I proposes an anomaly synthesis pipeline that stretches point clouds to create abundant anomaly data that are utilized to adapt the point cloud feature extractor for better feature representation. Stage-II establishes the global and local memory banks according to the global and local feature distributions of all the training data, weakening the impact of feature confusion on the establishment of the memory bank. Stage-III implements anomaly detection of test data leveraging its feature distance from global and local memory banks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD, Real3D-AD and actual industry parts dataset showcase our proposed GLFM's superior point cloud anomaly detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/hustCYQ/GLFM-Multi-class-3DAD.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/hustCYQ/GLFM-Multi-class-3DAD) |
| **[GAN-based synthetic FDG PET images from T1 brain MRI can serve to improve performance of deep unsupervised anomaly detection models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07364v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Objective. Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation, outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative image dataset are available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GradStop: Exploring Training Dynamics in Unsupervised Outlier Detection through Gradient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08501v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Outlier Detection (UOD) is a critical task in data mining and machine learning, aiming to identify instances that significantly deviate from the majority. Without any label, deep UOD methods struggle with the misalignment between the model's direct optimization goal and the final performance goal of Outlier Detection (OD) task. Through the perspective of training dynamics, this paper proposes an early stopping algorithm to optimize the training of deep UOD models, ensuring they perform optimally in OD rather than overfitting the entire contaminated dataset. Inspired by UOD mechanism and inlier priority phenomenon, where intuitively models fit inliers more quickly than outliers, we propose GradStop, a sampling-based label-free algorithm to estimate model's real-time performance during training. First, a sampling method generates two sets: one likely containing more outliers and the other more inliers, then a metric based on gradient cohesion is applied to probe into current training dynamics, which reflects model's performance on OD task. Experimental results on 4 deep UOD algorithms and 47 real-world datasets and theoretical proofs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed early stopping algorithm in enhancing the performance of deep UOD models. Auto Encoder (AE) enhanced by GradStop achieves better performance than itself, other SOTA UOD methods, and even ensemble AEs. Our method provides a robust and effective solution to the problem of performance degradation during training, enabling deep UOD models to achieve better potential in anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Scalable IoT Deployment for Visual Anomaly Detection via Efficient Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07119v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a key task in industrial settings, where minimizing waste and operational costs is essential. Deploying deep learning models within Internet of Things (IoT) environments introduces specific challenges due to the limited computational power and bandwidth of edge devices. This study investigates how to perform VAD effectively under such constraints by leveraging compact and efficient processing strategies. We evaluate several data compression techniques, examining the trade-off between system latency and detection accuracy. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate that significant compression can be achieved with minimal loss in anomaly detection performance compared to uncompressed data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MAPL: Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06198v3)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large unlabeled data and difficult-to-identify anomalies are the urgent issues need to overcome in most industrial scene. In order to address this issue, a new meth-odology for detecting surface defects in in-dustrial settings is introduced, referred to as Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling(MAPL). The methodology first in-troduces an anomaly simulation strategy, which significantly improves the model's ability to recognize rare or unknown anom-aly types by generating simulated anomaly samples. To cope with the problem of the lack of labeling of anomalous simulated samples, a pseudo-labeler method based on a one-classifier ensemble was employed in this study, which enhances the robustness of the model in the case of limited labeling data by automatically selecting key pseudo-labeling hyperparameters. Meanwhile, a memory-enhanced learning mechanism is introduced to effectively predict abnormal regions by analyzing the difference be-tween the input samples and the normal samples in the memory pool. An end-to-end learning framework is employed by MAPL to identify the abnormal regions directly from the input data, which optimizes the ef-ficiency and real-time performance of de-tection. By conducting extensive trials on the recently developed BHAD dataset (in-cluding MVTec AD [1], Visa [2], and MDPP [3]), MAPL achieves an average im-age-level AUROC score of 86.2%, demon-strating a 5.1% enhancement compared to the original MemSeg [4] model.

The contribution of the proposed research is towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection, data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs. Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage in terms of privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sched...</summary><p>Scheduled for presentation at an upcoming conference</p></details> | None |
| **[ReplayCAD: Generative Diffusion Replay for Continual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06603v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) enables anomaly detection models in learning new classes while preserving knowledge of historical classes. CAD faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and segmentation of small anomalous regions. Existing CAD methods store image distributions or patch features to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but they fail to preserve pixel-level detailed features for accurate segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose ReplayCAD, a novel diffusion-driven generative replay framework that replay high-quality historical data, thus effectively preserving pixel-level detailed features. Specifically, we compress historical data by searching for a class semantic embedding in the conditional space of the pre-trained diffusion model, which can guide the model to replay data with fine-grained pixel details, thus improving the segmentation performance. However, relying solely on semantic features results in limited spatial diversity. Hence, we further use spatial features to guide data compression, achieving precise control of sample space, thereby generating more diverse data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation, with notable improvements in segmentation: 11.5% on VisA and 8.1% on MVTec.

This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Distributional Drift Detection in Medical Imaging with Sketching and Fine-Tuned Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08456v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributional drift detection is important in medical applications as it helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of models by identifying changes in the underlying data distribution that could affect the prediction results of machine learning models. However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift, for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Vision Transformer model to extract relevant features, using mammography as a case study, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50% increased to 99.1%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GDformer: Going Beyond Subsequence Isolation for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18196v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection of multivariate time series is a challenging task, given the requirements of deriving a compact detection criterion without accessing the anomaly points. The existing methods are mainly based on reconstruction error or association divergence, which are both confined to isolated subsequences with limited horizons, hardly promising unified series-level criterion. In this paper, we propose the Global Dictionary-enhanced Transformer (GDformer) with a renovated dictionary-based cross attention mechanism to cultivate the global representations shared by all normal points in the entire series. Accordingly, the cross-attention maps reflect the correlation weights between the point and global representations, which naturally leads to the representation-wise similarity-based detection criterion. To foster more compact detection boundary, prototypes are introduced to capture the distribution of normal point-global correlation weights. GDformer consistently achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection performance on five real-world benchmark datasets. Further experiments validate the global dictionary has great transferability among various datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/yuppielqx/GDformer.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/yuppielqx/GDformer) |
| **[Examining the Source of Defects from a Mechanical Perspective for 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05901v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we go beyond identifying anomalies only in structural terms and think about better anomaly detection motivated by anomaly causes. Most anomalies are regarded as the result of unpredictable defective forces from internal and external sources, and their opposite forces are sought to correct the anomalies. We introduced a Mechanics Complementary framework for 3D anomaly detection (MC4AD) to generate internal and external Corrective forces for each point. A Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module is first proposed to simulate various anomalies. Then, we present a Corrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net) with complementary representations for point-level representation to simulate the different contributions of internal and external corrective forces. A combined loss was proposed, including a new symmetric loss and an overall loss, to constrain the corrective forces properly. As a highlight, we consider 3D anomaly detection in industry more comprehensively, creating a hierarchical quality control strategy based on a three-way decision and contributing a dataset named Anomaly-IntraVariance with intraclass variance to evaluate the model. On the proposed and existing five datasets, we obtained nine state-of-the-art performers with the minimum parameters and the fastest inference speed.

| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Robots via Mahalanobis SVDD with Audio-IMU Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05811v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable anomaly detection is essential for ensuring the safety of autonomous robots, particularly when conventional detection systems based on vision or LiDAR become unreliable in adverse or unpredictable conditions. In such scenarios, alternative sensing modalities are needed to provide timely and robust feedback. To this end, we explore the use of audio and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to detect underlying anomalies in autonomous mobile robots, such as collisions and internal mechanical faults. Furthermore, to address the challenge of limited labeled anomaly data, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on Mahalanobis Support Vector Data Description (M-SVDD). In contrast to conventional SVDD methods that rely on Euclidean distance and assume isotropic feature distributions, our approach employs the Mahalanobis distance to adaptively scale feature dimensions and capture inter-feature correlations, enabling more expressive decision boundaries. In addition, a reconstruction-based auxiliary branch is introduced to preserve feature diversity and prevent representation collapse, further enhancing the robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on a collected mobile robot dataset and four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as shown in the video https://youtu.be/yh1tn6DDD4A. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/jamesyang7/M-SVDD.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/jamesyang7/M-SVDD) |

The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A real-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed to illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with enhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[KPI Poisoning: An Attack in Open RAN Near Real-Time Control Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05537v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is a new paradigm to provide fundamental features for supporting next-generation mobile networks. Disaggregation, virtualisation, closed-loop data-driven control, and open interfaces bring flexibility and interoperability to the network deployment. However, these features also create a new surface for security threats. In this paper, we introduce Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) poisoning attack in Near Real-Time control loops as a new form of threat that can have significant effects on the Open RAN functionality. This threat can arise from traffic spoofing on the E2 interface or compromised E2 nodes. The role of KPIs is explored in the use cases of Near Real-Time control loops. Then, the potential impacts of the attack are analysed. An ML-based approach is proposed to detect poisoned KPI values before using them in control loops. Emulations are conducted to generate KPI reports and inject anomalies into the values. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model is used to detect anomalies. The results show that more amplified injected values are more accessible to detect, and using more report sequences leads to better performance in anomaly detection, with detection rates improving from 62% to 99%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE FNWF 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference.

| **[QUIC-Exfil: Exploiting QUIC's Server Preferred Address Feature to Perform Data Exfiltration Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05292v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The QUIC protocol is now widely adopted by major tech companies and accounts for a significant fraction of today's Internet traffic. QUIC's multiplexing capabilities, encrypted headers, dynamic IP address changes, and encrypted parameter negotiations make the protocol not only more efficient, secure, and censorship-resistant, but also practically unmanageable by firewalls. This opens doors for attackers who may exploit certain traits of the QUIC protocol to perform targeted attacks, such as data exfiltration attacks. Whereas existing data exfiltration techniques, such as TLS and DNS-based exfiltration, can be detected on a firewall level, QUIC-based data exfiltration is more difficult to detect, since changes in IP addresses and ports are inherent to the protocol's normal behavior. To show the feasibility of a QUIC-based data exfiltration attack, we introduce a novel method leveraging the server preferred address feature of the QUIC protocol and, thus, allows an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data from an infected machine to a malicious server, disguised as a server-side connection migration. The attack is implemented as a proof of concept tool in Rust. We evaluated the performance of five anomaly detection classifiers - Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest - trained on datasets collected from three network traffic scenarios. The classifiers were trained on over 700K benign and malicious QUIC packets and 786 connection migration events, but were unable to detect the data exfiltration attempts. Furthermore, post-analysis of the traffic captures did not reveal any identifiable fingerprint. As part of our evaluation, we also interviewed five leading firewall vendors and found that, as of today, no major firewall vendor implements functionality capable of distinguishing between benign and malicious QUIC connection migrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Research on Anomaly Detection Methods Based on Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05137v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining, with significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and clinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 table | None |
| **[RoBERTa-Augmented Synthesis for Detecting Malicious API Requests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11258v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web applications and APIs face constant threats from malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities for illicit gains. To defend against these threats, it is essential to have anomaly detection systems that can identify a variety of malicious behaviors. However, a significant challenge in this area is the limited availability of training data. Existing datasets often do not provide sufficient coverage of the diverse API structures, parameter formats, and usage patterns encountered in real-world scenarios. As a result, models trained on these datasets often struggle to generalize and may fail to detect less common or emerging attack vectors. To enhance detection accuracy and robustness, it is crucial to access larger and more representative datasets that capture the true variability of API traffic. To address this, we introduce a GAN-inspired learning framework that extends limited API traffic datasets through targeted, domain-aware synthesis. Drawing on techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), our approach leverages Transformer-based architectures, particularly RoBERTa, to enhance the contextual representation of API requests and generate realistic synthetic samples aligned with security-specific semantics. We evaluate our framework on two benchmark datasets, CSIC 2010 and ATRDF 2023, and compare it with a previous data augmentation technique to assess the importance of domain-specific synthesis. In addition, we apply our augmented data to various anomaly detection models to evaluate its impact on classification performance. Our method achieves up to a 4.94% increase in F1 score on CSIC 2010 and up to 21.10% on ATRDF 2023.

Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Protecting Privacy in Software Logs: What Should Be Anonymized?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11313v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software logs, generated during the runtime of software systems, are essential for various development and analysis activities, such as anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. However, the presence of sensitive information in these logs poses significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers that could lead to re-identification risks. While general data privacy has been extensively studied, the specific domain of privacy in software logs remains underexplored, with inconsistent definitions of sensitivity and a lack of standardized guidelines for anonymization. To mitigate this gap, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of privacy in software logs from multiple perspectives. We start by performing an analysis of 25 publicly available log datasets to identify potentially sensitive attributes. Based on the result of this step, we focus on three perspectives: privacy regulations, research literature, and industry practices. We first analyze key data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to understand the legal requirements concerning sensitive information in logs. Second, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify common privacy attributes and practices in log anonymization, revealing gaps in existing approaches. Finally, we survey 45 industry professionals to capture practical insights on log anonymization practices. Our findings shed light on various perspectives of log privacy and reveal industry challenges, such as technical and efficiency issues while highlighting the need for standardized guidelines.

Accurately simulating these tasks is also difficult. Hence, it is crucial for robust task performance to learn how to coordinate end-effector pose and applied force, monitor execution, and react to deviations. To address these challenges, we propose a learning approach that directly infers both low- and high-level task representations from user demonstrations on the real system. We developed an unsupervised task segmentation algorithm that combines intention recognition and feature clustering to infer the skills of a task. We leverage the inferred characteristic features of each skill in a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach to identify deviations from the intended task execution. Together, these components form a comprehensive framework capable of incrementally learning task decisions and new behaviors as new situations arise. Compared to state-of-the-art learning techniques, our approach significantly reduces the required amount of training data and computational complexity while efficiently learning complex in-contact behaviors and recovery strategies. Our proposed task segmentation and anomaly detection approaches outperform state-of-the-art methods on force-based tasks evaluated on two different robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted for publication by the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 26 pages</p></details> | None |

Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Detecting Spelling and Grammatical Anomalies in Russian Poetry Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04507v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of natural language texts in fine-tuning datasets plays a critical role in the performance of generative models, particularly in computational creativity tasks such as poem or song lyric generation. Fluency defects in generated poems significantly reduce their value. However, training texts are often sourced from internet-based platforms without stringent quality control, posing a challenge for data engineers to manage defect levels effectively. To address this issue, we propose the use of automated linguistic anomaly detection to identify and filter out low-quality texts from training datasets for creative models. In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of unsupervised and supervised text anomaly detection approaches, utilizing both synthetic and human-labeled datasets. We also introduce the RUPOR dataset, a collection of Russian-language human-labeled poems designed for cross-sentence grammatical error detection, and provide the full evaluation code. Our work aims to empower the community with tools and insights to improve the quality of training datasets for generative models in creative domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Semi-Supervised and Semi-Asynchronous Learning for Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11981v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing FL-based approaches are based on the unrealistic assumption that the data on the client-side is fully annotated with ground truths. Furthermore, it is a great challenge how to improve the training efficiency while ensuring the detection accuracy in the highly heterogeneous and resource-constrained IoT networks. Meanwhile, the communication cost between clients and the server is also a problem that can not be ignored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Federated Semi-Supervised and Semi-Asynchronous (FedS3A) learning for anomaly detection in IoT networks. First, we consider a more realistic assumption that labeled data is only available at the server, and pseudo-labeling is utilized to implement federated semi-supervised learning, in which a dynamic weight of supervised learning is exploited to balance the supervised learning at the server and unsupervised learning at clients. Then, we propose a semi-asynchronous model update and staleness tolerant distribution scheme to achieve a trade-off between the round efficiency and detection accuracy. Meanwhile, the staleness of local models and the participation frequency of clients are considered to adjust their contributions to the global model. In addition, a group-based aggregation function is proposed to deal with the non-IID distribution of the data. Finally, the difference transmission based on the sparse matrix is adopted to reduce the communication cost. Extensive experimental results show that FedS3A can achieve greater than 98% accuracy even when the data is non-IID and is superior to the classic FL-based algorithms in terms of both detection performance and round efficiency, achieving a win-win situation. Meanwhile, FedS3A successfully reduces the communication cost by higher than 50%.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures | None |

A basic principle in cybersecurity is to be always alert. Therefore, automation is imperative in processes where the volume of daily operations is large. Several cybersecurity applications can be addressed as binary classification problems, including anomaly detection, fraud detection, intrusion detection, spam detection, or malware detection. We present three experiments. In the first experiment, we evaluate single classifiers including Random Forests, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree. In the second experiment, we test different sampling techniques including over-sampling, under-sampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, and Self-Paced Ensembling. In the last experiment, we evaluate Self-Paced Ensembling and its number of base classifiers. We found that imbalance learning techniques had positive and negative effects, as reported in related studies. Thus, these techniques should be applied with caution. Besides, we found different best performers for each dataset. Therefore, we recommend testing single classifiers and imbalance learning techniques for each new dataset and application involving imbalanced datasets as is the case in several cyber security applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

We present AnomalyMatch, an anomaly detection framework combining the semi-supervised FixMatch algorithm using EfficientNet classifiers with active learning. By treating anomaly detection as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, we efficiently utilise limited labelled and abundant unlabelled images. We allow iterative model refinement in a user interface for expert verification of high-confidence anomalies and correction of false positives. Built for astronomical data, AnomalyMatch generalises readily to other domains facing similar data challenges. Evaluations on the GalaxyMNIST astronomical dataset and the miniImageNet natural-image benchmark under severe class imbalance (1% anomalies for miniImageNet) display strong performance: starting from five to ten labelled anomalies and after three active learning cycles, we achieve an average AUROC of 0.95 (miniImageNet) and 0.86 (GalaxyMNIST), with respective AUPRC of 0.77 and 0.71. After active learning cycles, anomalies are ranked with 71% (miniImageNet) to 93% precision in the 1% of the highest-ranked images. AnomalyMatch is tailored for large-scale applications, efficiently processing predictions for 100 million images within three days on a single GPU. Integrated into ESAs Datalabs platform, AnomalyMatch facilitates targeted discovery of scientifically valuable anomalies in vast astronomical datasets. Our results underscore the exceptional utility and scalability of this approach for anomaly discovery, highlighting the value of specialised approaches for domains characterised by severe label scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal submission in preparation</p></details> | None |

However, existing anomaly detection datasets predominantly focus on surface defects in visible-light images, lacking publicly available X-ray datasets targeting internal defects in components. To address this gap, we construct the first publicly accessible component X-ray anomaly detection (CXR-AD) dataset, comprising real-world X-ray images. The dataset covers five industrial component categories, including 653 normal samples and 561 defect samples with precise pixel-level mask annotations. We systematically analyze the dataset characteristics and identify three major technical challenges: (1) strong coupling between complex internal structures and defect regions, (2) inherent low contrast and high noise interference in X-ray imaging, and (3) significant variations in defect scales and morphologies. To evaluate dataset complexity, we benchmark three state-of-the-art anomaly detection frameworks (feature-based, reconstruction-based, and zero-shot learning methods). Experimental results demonstrate a 29.78% average performance degradation on CXR-AD compared to MVTec AD, highlighting the limitations of current algorithms in handling internal defect detection tasks. To the best of our knowledge, CXR-AD represents the first publicly available X-ray dataset for component anomaly detection, providing a real-world industrial benchmark to advance algorithm development and enhance precision in internal defect inspection technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  | None |

Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been extensively studied, showcasing varying abilities to manage complex inputs and balance performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we formulate anomaly detection in complex human behavior by modeling raw GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each characterized by spatio-temporal features, along with trips (i.e. commute) between the stay-points. Our problem formulation allows us to leverage modern sequence models for unsupervised training and anomaly detection. Notably, we equip our proposed model USTAD (for Uncertainty-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection) with aleatoric (i.e. data) uncertainty estimation to account for inherent stochasticity in certain individuals' behavior, as well as epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty to handle data sparsity under a large variety of human behaviors. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties unlock a robust loss function as well as uncertainty-aware decision-making in anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments shows that USTAD improves anomaly detection AUCROC by 3\%-15\% over baselines in industry-scale data.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we present an explainable anomaly detection framework that identifies clinically meaningful increases in symptom severity using consumer-grade wearable data. Leveraging data from 2,023 participants with defined healthy baselines, our LSTM autoencoder model learned normal health patterns of sleep duration, step count, and resting heart rate. Anomalies were flagged when self-reported depression or anxiety scores increased by >=5 points (a threshold considered clinically significant). The model achieved an adjusted F1-score of 0.80 (precision = 0.73, recall = 0.88) in detecting 393 symptom-worsening episodes across 341 participants, with higher performance observed for episodes involving concurrent depression and anxiety escalation (F1 = 0.84) and for more pronounced symptom changes (>=10-point increases, F1 = 0.85). Model interpretability was supported by SHAP-based analysis, which identified resting heart rate as the most influential feature in 71.4 percentage of detected anomalies, followed by physical activity and sleep. Together, our findings highlight the potential of explainable anomaly detection to enable personalized, scalable, and proactive mental health monitoring in real-world settings.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, anomaly classification-distinguishing different types of anomalies-remains largely unexplored despite its critical importance in real-world inspection tasks. To address this gap, we propose VELM, a novel LLM-based pipeline for anomaly classification. Given the critical importance of inference speed, we first apply an unsupervised anomaly detection method as a vision expert to assess the normality of an observation. If an anomaly is detected, the LLM then classifies its type. A key challenge in developing and evaluating anomaly classification models is the lack of precise annotations of anomaly classes in existing datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce MVTec-AC and VisA-AC, refined versions of the widely used MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, which include accurate anomaly class labels for rigorous evaluation. Our approach achieves a state-of-the-art anomaly classification accuracy of 80.4% on MVTec-AD, exceeding the prior baselines by 5%, and 84% on MVTec-AC, demonstrating the effectiveness of VELM in understanding and categorizing anomalies. We hope our methodology and benchmark inspire further research in anomaly classification, helping bridge the gap between detection and comprehensive anomaly characterization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight presentation paper at the VAND Workshop, CVPR 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> | None |

We introduce a novel dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve robustness and precision.

To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors.

However, existing methods typically require carefully training a task-specific model for each category independently, leading to high cost, low efficiency, and weak generalization. Therefore, this paper presents a novel unified model for Multi-Category 3D Anomaly Detection (MC3D-AD) that aims to utilize both local and global geometry-aware information to reconstruct normal representations of all categories. First, to learn robust and generalized features of different categories, we propose an adaptive geometry-aware masked attention module that extracts geometry variation information to guide mask attention. Then, we introduce a local geometry-aware encoder reinforced by the improved mask attention to encode group-level feature tokens. Finally, we design a global query decoder that utilizes point cloud position embeddings to improve the decoding process and reconstruction ability. This leads to local and global geometry-aware reconstructed feature tokens for the AD task. MC3D-AD is evaluated on two publicly available Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, and exhibits significant superiority over current state-of-the-art single-category methods, achieving 3.1\% and 9.3\% improvement in object-level AUROC over Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet, respectively.

These cyber-physical systems depend on multiple sensor inputs, such as cameras, GPS receivers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, with faults potentially leading to physical instability and serious safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, anomaly detection has emerged as a crucial safeguarding mechanism, capable of identifying the physical manifestations of emerging issues and allowing operators to take preemptive action at runtime. Recent anomaly detection methods based on LSTM neural networks have shown promising results, but three challenges persist: the need for models that can generalise across the diverse mission profiles of drones; the need for interpretability, enabling operators to understand the nature of detected problems; and the need for capturing domain knowledge that is difficult to infer solely from log data. Motivated by these challenges, this paper introduces RADD, an integrated approach to anomaly detection in drones that combines rule mining and unsupervised learning. In particular, we leverage rules (or invariants) to capture expected relationships between sensors and actuators during missions, and utilise unsupervised learning techniques to cover more subtle relationships that the rules may have missed. We implement this approach using the ArduPilot drone software in the Gazebo simulator, utilising 44 rules derived across the main phases of drone missions, in conjunction with an ensemble of five unsupervised learning models. We find that our integrated approach successfully detects 93.84% of anomalies over six types of faults with a low false positive rate (2.33%), and can be deployed effectively at runtime. Furthermore, RADD outperforms a state-of-the-art LSTM-based method in detecting the different types of faults evaluated in our study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 29th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2025)</p></details> | None |

While numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data without compromising guaranteed FDR control.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.</p></details> |  | None |

Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional network-layer defenses are often inaccessible to transportation agencies, necessitating a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on traffic flow data. In this study, we simulate cyberattacks in a semi-realistic environment, using a virtualized traffic network to analyze disruption patterns. We develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system, demonstrating that Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance are key indicators of compromised signals. To enhance interpretability, we apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, identifying critical decision factors and diagnosing misclassification errors. Our analysis reveals two primary challenges: transitional data inconsistencies, where mislabeled recovery-phase traffic misleads the model, and model limitations, where stealth attacks in low-traffic conditions evade detection. This work enhances AI-driven traffic security, improving both detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart transportation systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01476v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 10 tables, accepted by Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning ( ICML 2025 )</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD) |
| **[Secure Cluster-Based Hierarchical Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01186v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to address challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to adversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly compromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL architecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient ascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment for each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity analyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional deviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive thresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric, dynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each vehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing vehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented, which assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy vehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency check is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple compromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms form a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and 3-hop topologies.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[FreCT: Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer for Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00941v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is critical for system monitoring and risk identification, across various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, IMUs are susceptible to physical attacks, including acoustic resonant and electromagnetic interference attacks, resulting in immediate UAV crashes. Consequently, we introduce a Model-based Anomaly detection and Recovery System (MARS) that enables UAVs to quickly detect adversarial attacks on inertial sensors and achieve dynamic flight recovery. MARS features an attack-resilient state estimator based on the Extended Kalman Filter, which incorporates position, velocity, heading, and rotor speed measurements to reconstruct accurate attitude and angular velocity information for UAV control. Moreover, a statistical anomaly detection system monitors IMU sensor data, raising a system-level alert if an attack is detected. Upon receiving the alert, a multi-stage dynamic flight recovery strategy suspends the ongoing mission, stabilizes the drone in a hovering condition, and then resumes tasks under the resilient control. Experimental results in PX4 software-in-the-loop environments as well as real-world MARS-PX4 autopilot-equipped drones demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing IMU-defense frameworks, showcasing the ability of the UAVs to survive attacks and complete the missions.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents an AI-powered Insider Risk Management (IRM) system that integrates behavioral analytics, dynamic risk scoring, and real-time policy enforcement to detect and mitigate insider threats with high accuracy and adaptability. We introduce a hybrid scoring mechanism - transitioning from the static PRISM model to an adaptive AI-based model utilizing an autoencoder neural network trained on expert-annotated user activity data. Through iterative feedback loops and continuous learning, the system reduces false positives by 59% and improves true positive detection rates by 30%, demonstrating substantial gains in detection precision. Additionally, the platform scales efficiently, processing up to 10 million log events daily with sub-300ms query latency, and supports automated enforcement actions for policy violations, reducing manual intervention. The IRM system's deployment resulted in a 47% reduction in incident response times, highlighting its operational impact. Future enhancements include integrating explainable AI, federated learning, graph-based anomaly detection, and alignment with Zero Trust principles to further elevate its adaptability, transparency, and compliance-readiness. This work establishes a scalable and proactive framework for mitigating emerging insider risks in both on-premises and hybrid environments.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which incorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep learning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification. We conduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the integration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline. Anomaly maps, generated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from normal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous regions. We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the mean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). On the external test set, adU-Net achieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net model (0.605). The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection into segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with ADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for publication at 2025 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC) Copyright 2025 IEEE.

The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms.

| **[Learning Multi-view Multi-class Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21294v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The latest trend in anomaly detection is to train a unified model instead of training a separate model for each category. However, existing multi-class anomaly detection (MCAD) models perform poorly in multi-view scenarios because they often fail to effectively model the relationships and complementary information among different views. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-View Multi-Class Anomaly Detection model (MVMCAD), which integrates information from multiple views to accurately identify anomalies. Specifically, we propose a semi-frozen encoder, where a pre-encoder prior enhancement mechanism is added before the frozen encoder, enabling stable cross-view feature modeling and efficient adaptation for improved anomaly detection. Furthermore, we propose an Anomaly Amplification Module (AAM) that models global token interactions and suppresses normal regions to enhance anomaly signals, leading to improved detection performance in multi-view settings. Finally, we propose a Cross-Feature Loss that aligns shallow encoder features with deep decoder features and vice versa, enhancing the model's sensitivity to anomalies at different semantic levels under multi-view scenarios. Extensive experiments on the Real-IAD dataset for multi-view multi-class anomaly detection validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 91.0/88.6/82.1 and 99.1/43.9/48.2/95.2 for image-level and the pixel-level, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is an important task in various time-series applications such as e-commerce, cybersecurity, vehicle maintenance, and healthcare monitoring. However, this task is very challenging as it requires considering both the intra-variable dependency (relationships within a variable over time) and the inter-variable dependency (relationships between multiple variables) existing in time-series data. Recent graph-based approaches have made impressive progress in tackling the challenges of this field. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date review of TSAD using graphs, referred to as G-TSAD. First, we explore the significant potential of graph representation for time-series data and and its contributions to facilitating anomaly detection. Then, we review state-of-the-art graph anomaly detection techniques, mostly leveraging deep learning architectures, in the context of time series. For each method, we discuss its strengths, limitations, and the specific applications where it excels. Finally, we address both the technical and application challenges currently facing the field, and suggest potential future directions for advancing research and improving practical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (IEEE TPAMI)</p></details> | None |

Existing studies report on their capability to support various data-driven process analyses and even, to some extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This reasoning ability suggests that there is potential for LLMs to tackle semantics-aware process mining tasks, which are tasks that rely on an understanding of the meaning of activities and their relationships. Examples of these include process discovery, where the meaning of activities can indicate their dependency, whereas in anomaly detection the meaning can be used to recognize process behavior that is abnormal. In this paper, we systematically explore the capabilities of LLMs for such tasks. Unlike prior work, which largely evaluates LLMs in their default state, we investigate their utility through both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define five process mining tasks requiring semantic understanding and provide extensive benchmarking datasets for evaluation. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with challenging process mining tasks when used out of the box or with minimal in-context examples, they achieve strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks across a broad range of process types and industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, submitted to PS</p></details> | None |

To ensure data quality and integrity, advanced validation techniques were implemented utilizing models such as BERT's Next Sentence Prediction for sentence coherence, GPT-2 for overall plausibility, RoBERTa for logical consistency, autoencoders for anomaly detection, and conducted diversity analysis. Synthetic data that met all validation criteria were integrated into a comprehensive PostgreSQL database, serving as the data management system for the EHR application.

Safety is achieved by managing actuation (where electric signals are used to trigger physical movement), dependent on corresponding sensor readings; used as ground truth in decision making. Timely detection of anomalies (attacks, faults and unascertained states) in ICSs is crucial for the safe running of a plant, the safety of its personnel, and for the safe provision of any services provided. We propose an anomaly detection method that involves accurate linearization of the non-linear forms arising from sensor-actuator(s) relationships, primarily because solving linear models is easier and well understood. Further, the time complexity of the anomaly detection scenario/problem at hand is lowered using dimensionality reduction of the actuator(s) in relationship with a sensor. We accomplish this by using a well-known water treatment testbed as a use case. Our experiments show millisecond time response to detect anomalies and provide explainability; that are not simultaneously achieved by other state of the art AI/ML models with eXplainable AI (XAI) used for the same purpose. Further, we pin-point the sensor(s) and its actuation state for which anomaly was detected.</p></details> |  | None |

In the literature, ECG, actigraphy, speech, voice, and facial analysis have proven effective at detecting patients' emotions. On the other hand, these tools are invasive and do not integrate smoothly into the patient's daily life. HRV has also been proven to effectively indicate stress conditions, especially in combination with other signals. However, when HRV is derived from less invasive devices than the ECG, like wristbands and smartwatches, the quality of measurements significantly degrades. This paper presents a methodology for stress detection from a wristband based on a universal model for time series, UniTS, which we finetuned for the task and equipped with explainability features. We cast the problem as anomaly detection rather than classification to favor model adaptation to individual patients and allow the clinician to maintain greater control over the system's predictions. We demonstrate that our proposed model considerably surpasses 12 top-performing methods on three benchmark datasets. Furthermore, unlike other state-of-the-art systems, UniTS enables seamless monitoring, as it shows comparable performance when using signals from invasive or lightweight devices.</p></details> | 38 pages, 10 figures | None |

To overcome this challenge, researchers have started employing anomaly generation approaches to augment the anomaly dataset. However, existing anomaly generation methods suffer from limited diversity in the generated anomalies and struggle to achieve a seamless blending of this anomaly with the original image. Moreover, the generated mask is usually not aligned with the generated anomaly. In this paper, we overcome these challenges from a new perspective, simultaneously generating a pair of the overall image and the corresponding anomaly part. We propose DualAnoDiff, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly image generation model, which can generate diverse and realistic anomaly images by using a dual-interrelated diffusion model, where one of them is employed to generate the whole image while the other one generates the anomaly part. Moreover, we extract background and shape information to mitigate the distortion and blurriness phenomenon in few-shot image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, realism and the accuracy of mask. Overall, our approach significantly improves the performance of downstream anomaly inspection tasks, including anomaly detection, anomaly localization, and anomaly classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods select Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data as backdoor watermarks and retrain the original model for copyright protection. However, existing methods are susceptible to malicious detection and forgery by adversaries, resulting in watermark evasion. In this work, we propose Model-\underline{ag}nostic Black-box Backdoor W\underline{ate}rmarking Framework (AGATE) to address stealthiness and robustness challenges in multimodal model copyright protection. Specifically, we propose an adversarial trigger generation method to generate stealthy adversarial triggers from ordinary dataset, providing visual fidelity while inducing semantic shifts. To alleviate the issue of anomaly detection among model outputs, we propose a post-transform module to correct the model output by narrowing the distance between adversarial trigger image embedding and text embedding. Subsequently, a two-phase watermark verification is proposed to judge whether the current model infringes by comparing the two results with and without the transform module. Consequently, we consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods across five datasets in the downstream tasks of multimodal image-text retrieval and image classification. Additionally, we validated the robustness of AGATE under two adversarial attack scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a DT platform designed for a Spanish water supply network, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict water consumption. However, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). These attacks manipulate critical model parameters, injecting subtle distortions that degrade forecasting accuracy. To further exploit these vulnerabilities, we introduce a Learning Automata (LA) and Random LA-based approach that dynamically adjusts perturbations, making adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. Experimental results show that this approach significantly impacts prediction reliability, causing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to rise from 26% to over 35%. Moreover, adaptive attack strategies amplify this effect, highlighting cybersecurity risks in AI-driven DTs.

However, as these vehicles become more connected, cybersecurity threats have emerged as a serious concern. Protecting the security and integrity of autonomous systems is essential to prevent malicious activities that can harm passengers, other road users, and the overall transportation network. This paper focuses on addressing the cybersecurity issues in autonomous vehicles by examining the challenges and risks involved, which are important for building a secure future. Since autonomous vehicles depend on the communication between sensors, artificial intelligence, external infrastructure, and other systems, they are exposed to different types of cyber threats. A cybersecurity breach in an autonomous vehicle can cause serious problems, including a loss of public trust and safety. Therefore, it is very important to develop and apply strong cybersecurity measures to support the growth and acceptance of self-driving cars. This paper discusses major cybersecurity challenges like vulnerabilities in software and hardware, risks from wireless communication, and threats through external interfaces. It also reviews existing solutions such as secure software development, intrusion detection systems, cryptographic protocols, and anomaly detection methods. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of regulatory bodies, industry collaborations, and cybersecurity standards in creating a secure environment for autonomous vehicles.

| **[A Novel Multilevel Taxonomical Approach for Describing High-Dimensional Unlabeled Movement Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20174v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Movement data is prevalent across various applications and scientific fields, often characterized by its massive scale and complexity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in summarizing and describing such data, enabling researchers to generate insights and support scientific hypotheses. Despite its importance, traditional EDA practices face limitations when applied to high-dimensional, unlabeled movement data. The complexity and multi-faceted nature of this type of data require more advanced methods that go beyond the capabilities of current EDA techniques. This study addresses the gap in current EDA practices by proposing a novel approach that leverages movement variable taxonomies and outlier detection. We hypothesize that organizing movement features into a taxonomy, and applying anomaly detection to combinations of taxonomic nodes, can reveal meaningful patterns and lead to more interpretable descriptions of the data. To test this hypothesis, we introduce TUMD, a new method that integrates movement taxonomies with outlier detection to enhance data analysis and interpretation. TUMD was evaluated across four diverse datasets of moving objects using fixed parameter values. Its effectiveness was assessed through two passes: the first pass categorized the majority of movement patterns as Kinematic, Geometric, or Hybrid for all datasets, while the second pass refined these behaviors into more specific categories such as Speed, Acceleration, or Indentation. TUMD met the effectiveness criteria in three datasets, demonstrating its ability to describe and refine movement behaviors. The results confirmed our hypothesis, showing that the combination of movement taxonomies and anomaly detection successfully uncovers meaningful and interpretable patterns within high-dimensional, unlabeled movement data.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Shopformer: Transformer-Based Framework for Detecting Shoplifting via Human Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19970v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shoplifting remains a costly issue for the retail sector, but traditional surveillance systems, which are mostly based on human monitoring, are still largely ineffective, with only about 2% of shoplifters being arrested. Existing AI-based approaches rely on pixel-level video analysis which raises privacy concerns, is sensitive to environmental variations, and demands significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we introduce Shopformer, a novel transformer-based model that detects shoplifting by analyzing pose sequences rather than raw video. We propose a custom tokenization strategy that converts pose sequences into compact embeddings for efficient transformer processing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pose-sequence-based transformer model for shoplifting detection. Evaluated on real-world pose data, our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection models, offering a privacy-preserving, and scalable solution for real-time retail surveillance.

| **[Unsupervised Tomato Split Anomaly Detection using Hyperspectral Imaging and Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02921v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tomato anomalies/damages pose a significant challenge in greenhouse farming. While this method of cultivation benefits from efficient resource utilization, anomalies can significantly degrade the quality of farm produce. A common anomaly associated with tomatoes is splitting, characterized by the development of cracks on the tomato skin, which degrades its quality. Detecting this type of anomaly is challenging due to dynamic variations in appearance and sizes, compounded by dataset scarcity. We address this problem in an unsupervised manner by utilizing a tailored variational autoencoder (VAE) with hyperspectral input. Preliminary analysis of the dataset enabled us to select the optimal range of wavelengths for detecting this anomaly. Our findings indicate that the 530nm - 550nm range is suitable for identifying tomato dry splits. The proposed VAE model achieved a 97% detection accuracy for tomato split anomalies in the test data. The analysis on reconstruction loss allow us to not only detect the anomalies but also to some degree estimate the anomalous regions.</p></details> | CVPPA Workshop | None |
| **[LR-IAD:Mask-Free Industrial Anomaly Detection with Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19524v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for ensuring product quality by identifying defects. Traditional methods such as feature embedding and reconstruction-based approaches require large datasets and struggle with scalability. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) address some limitations but rely on mask annotations, leading to high implementation costs and false positives. Additionally, industrial datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA suffer from severe class imbalance, with defect samples constituting only 23.8% and 11.1% of total data respectively. To address these challenges, we propose a reward function that dynamically prioritizes rare defect patterns during training to handle class imbalance. We also introduce a mask-free reasoning framework using Chain of Thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) mechanisms, enabling anomaly detection directly from raw images without annotated masks. This approach generates interpretable step-by-step explanations for defect localization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches by 36% in accuracy on MVTec-AD and 16% on VisA. By eliminating mask dependency and reducing costs while providing explainable outputs, this work advances industrial anomaly detection and supports scalable quality control in manufacturing.

| **[Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-awareness Unknown Region for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19183v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of transformer-based architectures and large language models (LLMs), the accuracy of road scene perception has substantially advanced. Nonetheless, current road scene segmentation approaches are predominantly trained on closed-set data, resulting in insufficient detection capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. To overcome this limitation, road anomaly detection methods have been proposed. However, existing methods primarily depend on image inpainting and OOD distribution detection techniques, facing two critical issues: (1) inadequate consideration of the objectiveness attributes of anomalous regions, causing incomplete segmentation when anomalous objects share similarities with known classes, and (2) insufficient attention to environmental constraints, leading to the detection of anomalies irrelevant to autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-Awareness (SOTA) for autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, SOTA enhances the segmentation of objectiveness through a Semantic Fusion Block (SFB) and filters anomalies irrelevant to road navigation tasks using a Scene-understanding Guided Prompt-Context Adaptor (SG-PCA). Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fishyscapes Lost and Found, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly, demonstrate that the proposed SOTA consistently improves OOD detection performance across diverse detectors, achieving robust and accurate segmentation outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the distributed and dynamic nature of microservices introduces complexities in ensuring system reliability, making anomaly detection crucial for maintaining performance and functionality. Anomalies stemming from network and performance issues must be swiftly identified and addressed. Existing anomaly detection techniques often rely on statistical models or machine learning methods that struggle with the high-dimensional, interdependent data inherent in microservice applications. Current techniques and available datasets predominantly focus on system traces and logs, limiting their ability to support advanced detection models. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing the RS-Anomic dataset generated using the open-source RobotShop microservice application. The dataset captures multivariate performance metrics and response times under normal and anomalous conditions, encompassing ten types of anomalies. We propose a novel anomaly detection model called Graph Attention and LSTM-based Microservice Anomaly Detection (GAL-MAD), leveraging Graph Attention and Long Short-Term Memory architectures to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in microservices. We utilize SHAP values to localize anomalous services and identify root causes to enhance explainability. Experimental results demonstrate that GAL-MAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on the RS-Anomic dataset, achieving higher accuracy and recall across varying anomaly rates. The explanations provide actionable insights into service anomalies, which benefits system administrators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - Journal of Universal Computer Science, 13 pages, preprint, 7 figures</p></details> | None |

Specifically, we evaluate the MOMENT family of models, a set of transformer-based, pre-trained architectures for multivariate time series tasks such as: imputation, prediction, classification, and anomaly detection. We evaluate the capacity of these models on five datasets to capture the underlying structures in time series data within their latent space projection and validate whether fine tuning improves the clarity of the resulting embedding spaces. Notable performance improvements in terms of loss reduction were observed after fine tuning. Visual analysis shows limited improvement in the interpretability of the embeddings, requiring further work. Results suggest that, although Time Series Foundation Models such as MOMENT are robust, their latent spaces may require additional methodological refinements to be adequately interpreted, such as alternative projection techniques, loss functions, or data preprocessing strategies. Despite the limitations of MOMENT, foundation models supose a big reduction in execution time and so a great advance for interactive visual analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at the International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence (IJIMAI)</p></details> | None |
| **[Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model for Subsurface Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18802v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban roads and infrastructure, vital to city operations, face growing threats from subsurface anomalies like cracks and cavities. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) effectively visualizes underground conditions employing electromagnetic (EM) waves; however, accurate anomaly detection via GPR remains challenging due to limited labeled data, varying subsurface conditions, and indistinct target boundaries. Although visually image-like, GPR data fundamentally represent EM waves, with variations within and between waves critical for identifying anomalies. Addressing these, we propose the Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model (Res-SAM), an innovative framework exploiting both visual discernibility and wave-changing properties of GPR data. Res-SAM initially identifies apparent candidate anomaly regions given minimal prompts, and further refines them by analyzing anomaly-induced changing information within and between EM waves in local GPR data, enabling precise and complete anomaly region extraction and category determination. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Res-SAM achieves high detection accuracy (>85%) and outperforms state-of-the-art. Notably, Res-SAM requires only minimal accessible non-target data, avoids intensive training, and incorporates simple human interaction to enhance reliability. Our research provides a scalable, resource-efficient solution for rapid subsurface anomaly detection across diverse environments, improving urban safety monitoring while reducing manual effort and computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

The method includes data preparation, model training, and evaluation, using an 80/20 (train/test) split. Models tested include eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Multiple-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (MO-GAAL), with XGB and MLP further combined with Random-Over-Sampling (ROS) and Self-Paced-Ensemble (SPE). Evaluation involves 5-fold cross-validation and imputation techniques (mean, median, and IterativeImputer) with 10, 20, 30, and 50 % missing data. Findings show XGB and MLP outperform generative models. IterativeImputer results are comparable to mean and median, but not recommended for large datasets due to increased complexity and execution time.

One of the active research questions is where (in the model architecture or training pipeline) and how to efficiently incorporate always limited human perceptual data into training strategies of models. In this paper, we introduce MENTOR (huMan pErceptioN-guided preTraining fOr increased geneRalization), which addresses this question through two unique rounds of training CNNs tasked with open-set anomaly detection. First, we train an autoencoder to learn human saliency maps given an input image, without any class labels. The autoencoder is thus tasked with discovering domain-specific salient features which mimic human perception. Second, we remove the decoder part, add a classification layer on top of the encoder, and train this new model conventionally, now using class labels. We show that MENTOR successfully raises the generalization performance across three different CNN backbones in a variety of anomaly detection tasks (demonstrated for detection of unknown iris presentation attacks, synthetically-generated faces, and anomalies in chest X-ray images) compared to traditional pretraining methods (e.g., sourcing the weights from ImageNet), and as well as state-of-the-art methods that incorporate human perception guidance into training. In addition, we demonstrate that MENTOR can be flexibly applied to existing human perception-guided methods and subsequently increasing their generalization with no architectural modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

A popular approach to unsupervised AD is clustering-based detection. However, this method lacks the ability to guarantee the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this paper, we propose SI-CLAD (Statistical Inference for CLustering-based Anomaly Detection), a novel statistical framework for testing the clustering-based AD results. The key strength of SI-CLAD lies in its ability to rigorously control the probability of falsely identifying anomalies, maintaining it below a pre-specified significance level $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$). By analyzing the selection mechanism inherent in clustering-based AD and leveraging the Selective Inference (SI) framework, we prove that false detection control is attainable. Moreover, we introduce a strategy to boost the true detection rate, enhancing the overall performance of SI-CLAD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets provide strong empirical support for our theoretical findings, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, data-driven models based on machine learning and big data analysis have emerged for calculation purposes, leveraging the information available in large datasets obtained from smart meters and other advanced measurement infrastructure. However, existing data-driven algorithms do not take into account the quality of data collected from smart meters. They lack built-in anomaly detection mechanisms and fail to differentiate anomalies based on whether the value or context of anomalous data instances deviates from the norm. This paper focuses on methods for detecting and mitigating the impact of anomalies on the consumption of active and reactive power datasets. It proposes an anomaly detection framework based on the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform filtering that works in both the time and frequency domain and is unaffected by point anomalies or contextual anomalies of the power consumption data. The importance of integrating anomaly detection methods is demonstrated in the analysis important for distribution networks with a high share of smart meters.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we combine Bayesian learning with recent developments in quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, specifically orthogonal neural networks, to tackle this anomaly detection problem for an industrially relevant use case. Bayesian learning enables uncertainty quantification of predictions, while orthogonality in weight matrices enables smooth training. We develop orthogonal (quantum) versions of 3D convolutional neural networks and show that these models can successfully detect anomalies in 3D objects. To test the feasibility of incorporating quantum computers into a quantum-enhanced anomaly detection pipeline, we perform hardware experiments with our models on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane device, testing the effect of noise and limited measurement shots.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[A Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Data Drift and Anomaly Identification Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory and Statistical Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18599v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Drift is the phenomenon where the generating model behind the data changes over time. Due to data drift, any model built on the past training data becomes less relevant and inaccurate over time. Thus, detecting and controlling for data drift is critical in machine learning models. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins, inspired by how the human brain processes information. It is a biologically inspired model of memory that is similar in structure to the neocortex, and whose performance is claimed to be comparable to state of the art models in detecting anomalies in time series data. Another unique benefit of HTMs is its independence from training and testing cycle; all the learning takes place online with streaming data and no separate training and testing cycle is required. In sequential learning paradigm, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) offers some unique benefit for online learning and inference. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework combining HTM and SPRT for real-time data drift detection and anomaly identification. Unlike existing data drift methods, our approach eliminates frequent retraining and ensures low false positive rates. HTMs currently work with one dimensional or univariate data. In a second study, we also propose an application of HTM in multidimensional supervised scenario for anomaly detection by combining the outputs of multiple HTM columns, one for each dimension of the data, through a neural network. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional drift detection techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Wasserstein distance, and Population Stability Index (PSI) in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our experiments also provide insights into optimizing hyperparameters for real-time deployment in domains such as Telecom.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures | None |

DIVER enables run-time detection of anomalies and is targeted at devices running the real-time operating system (RTOS), VxWorks, which precludes traditional methods of implementing dynamic monitors using OS (e.g., Linux, Windows) functions. DIVER has two components. The "measurer" implant is embedded into the VxWorks kernel to collect run-time measurements and provide interactive/streaming interfaces over a TCP/IP port. The remote "listener" acquires and analyzes the measurements and provides an interactive user interface. DIVER focuses on small embedded devices with stringent resource constraints (e.g., insufficient storage to locally store measurements). We demonstrate efficacy of DIVER on the Motorola ACE Remote Terminal Unit used in CPS including power systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |

Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.</p></details> |  | None |

In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> | None |

A traffic anomaly refers to a generic incident on the road that influences traffic flow and calls for urgent traffic management measures. `Knowing'' the occurrence of a traffic anomaly is twofold: the ability to detect this anomaly before it is reported anywhere, or it may be such that an anomaly can be predicted before it actually occurs on the road (e.g., non-recurrent traffic breakdown). In either way, the objective is to inform traffic operators of unreported incidents in real time and as early as possible. The key is to stay ahead of the curve. Time is of the essence. Conventional automatic incident detection (AID) methods often struggle with early detection due to their limited consideration of spatial effects and early-stage characteristics. Therefore, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing prior domain knowledge and model-designing strategies. This allows the model to detect a broader range of anomalies, not only incidents that significantly influence traffic flow but also early characteristics of incidents along with historically unreported anomalies. We specially design the model to target the early-stage detection/prediction of an incident. Additionally, unlike most conventional AID studies, our method is highly scalable and generalizable, as it is fully automated with no manual selection of historical reports required, relies solely on widely available low-cost data, and requires no additional detectors. The experimental results across numerous road segments on different maps demonstrate that our model leads to more effective and early anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Several attempts to improve model generalization performance are heavily inspired by human perceptual intelligence, which is remarkable in both its performance and efficiency to generalize to unknown samples. Many of these methods attempt to force portions of the network to be orthogonal, following some observation within neuroscience related to early vision processes. In this paper, we propose a loss component that regularizes the filtering kernels in the first convolutional layer of a network to make them nearly orthogonal. Deviating from previous works, we give the network flexibility in which pairs of kernels it makes orthogonal, allowing the network to navigate to a better solution space, imposing harsh penalties. Without architectural modifications, we report substantial gains in generalization performance using the proposed loss against previous works (including orthogonalization- and saliency-based regularization methods) across three different architectures (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, ViT-b-16) and two difficult open-set recognition tasks: presentation attack detection in iris biometrics, and anomaly detection in chest X-ray images.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a large language model (LLM)-based network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system. In addition to existing models such as autoencoders and decision trees, we harness the power of large language models for processing sequence data from network traffic, which allows us a better capture of underlying complex patterns, as well as slight fluctuations in the dataset. We show for a given detection task, the need for a hybrid model that incorporates the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture into a supervised learning framework in order to achieve better accuracy. A pre-trained large language model analyzes and predicts the probable network traffic, and an anomaly detection layer that considers temporality and context is added. Moreover, we present a novel transfer learning-based methodology to enhance the model's effectiveness to quickly adapt to unknown network structures and adversarial conditions without requiring extensive labeled datasets. Actual results show that the designed model outperforms traditional methods in detection accuracy and computational efficiency, effectively identify various network anomalies such as zero-day attacks and traffic congestion pattern, and significantly reduce the false positive rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of 2025 IEEE 7th International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering (CISCE 2025)</p></details> | None |

Existing intrusion detection and prevention methods provide limited security as adversaries continually adapt their attack strategies. We propose a dynamic attack detection and prevention approach to address this challenge. First, blockchain-based authentication uses the Deoxys Authentication Algorithm (DAA) to verify IoT device legitimacy before data transmission. Next, a bi-stage intrusion detection system is introduced: the first stage uses signature-based detection via an Improved Random Forest (IRF) algorithm. In contrast, the second stage applies feature-based anomaly detection using a Diffusion Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN). To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) and maintain Service Level Agreements (SLA), trust-aware service migration is performed using Heap-Based Optimization (HBO). Additionally, on-demand virtual High-Interaction honeypots deceive attackers and extract attack patterns, which are securely stored using the Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) to enhance signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

| **[Explainable Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Random Forest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16075v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe the use of an unsupervised Random Forest for similarity learning and improved unsupervised anomaly detection. By training a Random Forest to discriminate between real data and synthetic data sampled from a uniform distribution over the real data bounds, a distance measure is obtained that anisometrically transforms the data, expanding distances at the boundary of the data manifold. We show that using distances recovered from this transformation improves the accuracy of unsupervised anomaly detection, compared to other commonly used detectors, demonstrated over a large number of benchmark datasets. As well as improved performance, this method has advantages over other unsupervised anomaly detection methods, including minimal requirements for data preprocessing, native handling of missing data, and potential for visualizations. By relating outlier scores to partitions of the Random Forest, we develop a method for locally explainable anomaly predictions in terms of feature importance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[CHASE: A Causal Hypergraph based Framework for Root Cause Analysis in Multimodal Microservice Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19711v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the widespread adoption of distributed microservice architectures within the industry has significantly increased the demand for enhanced system availability and robustness. Due to the complex service invocation paths and dependencies in enterprise-level microservice systems, it is challenging to locate the anomalies promptly during service invocations, thus causing intractable issues for normal system operations and maintenance. In this paper, we propose a Causal Heterogeneous grAph baSed framEwork for root cause analysis, namely CHASE, for microservice systems with multimodal data, including traces, logs, and system monitoring metrics. Specifically, related information is encoded into representative embeddings and further modeled by a multimodal invocation graph. Following that, anomaly detection is performed on each instance node with attentive heterogeneous message passing from its adjacent metric and log nodes. Finally, CHASE learns from the constructed hypergraph with hyperedges representing the flow of causality and performs root cause localization. We evaluate the proposed framework on two public microservice datasets with distinct attributes and compare with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that CHASE achieves the average performance gain up to 36.2%(A@1) and 29.4%(Percentage@1), respectively to its best counterpart.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional deterministic methods often fall short when it comes to capturing the inherent uncertainty of anomaly detection tasks. This paper introduces a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (VAE) equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms for detecting anomalies in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the purpose of improving anomaly detection performance, we incorporate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation through Bayesian inference. The model was tested on the BraTS2020 dataset, and the findings were a 0.83 ROC AUC and a 0.83 PR AUC. The data in our paper suggests that modeling uncertainty is an essential component of anomaly detection, enhancing both performance and interpretability and providing confidence estimates, as well as anomaly predictions, for clinicians to leverage in making medical decisions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Application of Deep Generative Models for Anomaly Detection in Complex Financial Transactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15491v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an algorithm for detecting suspicious behaviors in large payment flows based on deep generative models. By combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the algorithm is designed to detect abnormal behaviors in financial transactions. First, the GAN is used to generate simulated data that approximates normal payment flows. The discriminator identifies anomalous patterns in transactions, enabling the detection of potential fraud and money laundering behaviors. Second, a VAE is introduced to model the latent distribution of payment flows, ensuring that the generated data more closely resembles real transaction features, thus improving the model's detection accuracy. The method optimizes the generative capabilities of both GAN and VAE, ensuring that the model can effectively capture suspicious behaviors even in sparse data conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and other deep learning models across various evaluation metrics, especially in detecting rare fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed comparison of performance in recognizing different transaction patterns (such as normal, money laundering, and fraud) in large payment flows, validating the advantages of generative models in handling complex financial data.</p></details> |  | None |

Anomaly detection is crucial for such systems to facilitate predictive maintenance. However, most existing anomaly detection methods are designed for either univariate or single-system multivariate data, making them insufficient for these complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce M$^2$AD, a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series data from multiple systems. M$^2$AD employs deep models to capture expected behavior under normal conditions, using the residuals as indicators of potential anomalies. These residuals are then aggregated into a global anomaly score through a Gaussian Mixture Model and Gamma calibration. We theoretically demonstrate that this framework can effectively address heterogeneity and dependencies across sensors and systems. Empirically, M$^2$AD outperforms existing methods in extensive evaluations by 21% on average, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a large-scale real-world case study on 130 assets in Amazon Fulfillment Centers.

| **[AnomalyCLIP: Object-agnostic Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18961v9)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) requires detection models trained using auxiliary data to detect anomalies without any training sample in a target dataset. It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to various concerns, eg, data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as defects/tumors on different products/organs, can vary significantly. Recently large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks, including anomaly detection. However, their ZSAD performance is weak since the VLMs focus more on modeling the class semantics of the foreground objects rather than the abnormality/normality in the images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, namely AnomalyCLIP, to adapt CLIP for accurate ZSAD across different domains. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspection and medical imaging domains.

| **[GenCLIP: Generalizing CLIP Prompts for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14919v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to identify anomalies in unseen categories by leveraging CLIP's zero-shot capabilities to match text prompts with visual features. A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts stably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability and category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior works, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that learns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer prompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates category-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general prompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By combining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further enhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and generalization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a vision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while a query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from both branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across unseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering mechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered during CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute to the final vision-language alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Memory-Augmented Dual-Decoder Networks for Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14884v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) have shifted from single-class to multi-class scenarios. In such complex contexts, the increasing pattern diversity has brought two challenges to reconstruction-based approaches: (1) over-generalization: anomalies that are subtle or share compositional similarities with normal patterns may be reconstructed with high fidelity, making them difficult to distinguish from normal instances; and (2) insufficient normality reconstruction: complex normal features, such as intricate textures or fine-grained structures, may not be faithfully reconstructed due to the model's limited representational capacity, resulting in false positives. Existing methods typically focus on addressing the former, which unintentionally exacerbate the latter, resulting in inadequate representation of intricate normal patterns. To concurrently address these two challenges, we propose a Memory-augmented Dual-Decoder Networks (MDD-Net). This network includes two critical components: a Dual-Decoder Reverse Distillation Network (DRD-Net) and a Class-aware Memory Module (CMM). Specifically, the DRD-Net incorporates a restoration decoder designed to recover normal features from synthetic abnormal inputs and an identity decoder to reconstruct features that maintain the anomalous semantics. By exploiting the discrepancy between features produced by two decoders, our approach refines anomaly scores beyond the conventional encoder-decoder comparison paradigm, effectively reducing false positives and enhancing localization accuracy. Furthermore, the CMM explicitly encodes and preserves class-specific normal prototypes, actively steering the network away from anomaly reconstruction. Comprehensive experimental results across several benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our MDD-Net framework over current SoTA approaches in multi-class UAD tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> | None |

To handle such complexity, operations teams rely on monitoring systems, including anomaly detection tools that identify unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we present c-ANEMON, a Contextual ANomaly dEtection MONitor for the RAN based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our solution captures spatio-temporal variations by analyzing the behavior of individual cells in relation to their local neighborhoods, enabling the detection of anomalies that are independent of external mobility factors. This, in turn, allows focusing on anomalies associated with network issues (e.g., misconfigurations, equipment failures). We evaluate c-ANEMON using real-world data from a large European metropolitan area (7,890 cells; 3 months). First, we show that the GNN model within our solution generalizes effectively to cells from previously unseen areas, suggesting the possibility of using a single model across extensive deployment regions. Then, we analyze the anomalies detected by c-ANEMON through manual inspection and define several categories of long-lasting anomalies (6+ hours). Notably, 45.95% of these anomalies fall into a category that is more likely to require intervention by operations teams.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

In this paper, we present a novel application of Hierarchical Robust Principal Component Analysis (HrPCA) as a scalable, unsupervised anomaly detection technique tailored to DQ monitoring in multi-level aggregation pipelines. We propose a modular framework that decomposes the data at each hierarchical level into low-rank representations and sparse residuals, allowing the detection of subtle inconsistencies, outliers, and misalignments in the aggregated data. We evaluated our approach using synthetic hierarchical datasets with controlled anomalies and demonstrated how HrPCA outperforms traditional rule-based methods in detecting data corruption and rollup inconsistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 3 figures ,submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

It isn't easy to strike a balance between visual privacy and action recognition performance in most computer vision models. Is it possible to safeguard privacy without sacrificing performance? It poses a formidable challenge, as even minor privacy enhancements can lead to substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving image anonymization technique that optimizes the anonymizer using penalties from the utility branch, ensuring improved action recognition performance while minimally affecting privacy leakage. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing privacy leakage and maintaining high action performance. The proposed approach is primarily designed to align with the regulatory standards of the EU AI Act and GDPR, ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information while maintaining action performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a feature-based penalty scheme that exclusively controls the action features, allowing freedom to anonymize private attributes. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that applying a penalty to anonymizer from utility branch enhances action performance while maintaining nearly consistent privacy leakage across different penalty settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPRW 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[A Pre-Training and Adaptive Fine-Tuning Framework for Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14250v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has garnered increasing attention in recent years, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of abnormal nodes and the high cost of label annotations. Graph pre-training, the two-stage learning paradigm, has emerged as an effective approach for label-efficient learning, largely benefiting from expressive neighborhood aggregation under the assumption of strong homophily. However, in GAD, anomalies typically exhibit high local heterophily, while normal nodes retain strong homophily, resulting in a complex homophily-heterophily mixture. To understand the impact of this mixed pattern on graph pre-training, we analyze it through the lens of spectral filtering and reveal that relying solely on a global low-pass filter is insufficient for GAD. We further provide a theoretical justification for the necessity of selectively applying appropriate filters to individual nodes. Building upon this insight, we propose PAF, a Pre-Training and Adaptive Fine-tuning framework specifically designed for GAD. In particular, we introduce joint training with low- and high-pass filters in the pre-training phase to capture the full spectrum of frequency information in node features. During fine-tuning, we devise a gated fusion network that adaptively combines node representations generated by both filters. Extensive experiments across ten benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of PAF.</p></details> |  | None |

However, dedicated multimodal datasets specifically tailored for IAD remain limited. Pioneering datasets like MVTec 3D have laid essential groundwork in multimodal IAD by incorporating RGB+3D data, but still face challenges in bridging the gap with real industrial environments due to limitations in scale and resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Real-IAD D3, a high-precision multimodal dataset that uniquely incorporates an additional pseudo3D modality generated through photometric stereo, alongside high-resolution RGB images and micrometer-level 3D point clouds. Real-IAD D3 features finer defects, diverse anomalies, and greater scale across 20 categories, providing a challenging benchmark for multimodal IAD Additionally, we introduce an effective approach that integrates RGB, point cloud, and pseudo-3D depth information to leverage the complementary strengths of each modality, enhancing detection performance.

However, real-world sequential data often exhibit a superimposed state of various fluctuation patterns, including hourly, daily, and monthly frequencies. Traditional decomposition techniques struggle to effectively disentangle these multiple fluctuation patterns from the seasonal components, making time series analysis challenging. Surpassing the existing multi-period decoupling paradigms, this paper introduces a novel perspective based on energy distribution within the temporal-spectrum space. By adaptively quantifying observed sequences into continuous frequency band intervals, the proposed approach reconstructs fluctuation patterns across diverse periods without relying on domain-specific prior knowledge. Building upon this innovative strategy, we propose Pets, an enhanced architecture that is adaptable to arbitrary model structures. Pets integrates a Fluctuation Pattern Assisted (FPA) module and a Context-Guided Mixture of Predictors (MoP). The FPA module facilitates information fusion among diverse fluctuation patterns by capturing their dependencies and progressively modeling these patterns as latent representations at each layer. Meanwhile, the MoP module leverages these compound pattern representations to guide and regulate the reconstruction of distinct fluctuations hierarchically. Pets achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification, while demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Decomposition-based multi-scale transformer framework for time series anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14206v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is crucial for maintaining stable systems. Existing methods face two main challenges. First, it is difficult to directly model the dependencies of diverse and complex patterns within the sequences. Second, many methods that optimize parameters using mean squared error struggle with noise in the time series, leading to performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based framework built on decomposition (TransDe) for multivariate time series anomaly detection. The key idea is to combine the strengths of time series decomposition and transformers to effectively learn the complex patterns in normal time series data. A multi-scale patch-based transformer architecture is proposed to exploit the representative dependencies of each decomposed component of the time series. Furthermore, a contrastive learn paradigm based on patch operation is proposed, which leverages KL divergence to align the positive pairs, namely the pure representations of normal patterns between different patch-level views. A novel asynchronous loss function with a stop-gradient strategy is further introduced to enhance the performance of TransDe effectively. It can avoid time-consuming and labor-intensive computation costs in the optimization process. Extensive experiments on five public datasets are conducted and TransDe shows superiority compared with twelve baselines in terms of F1 score.

Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines.

Recent machine learning approaches for road anomaly detection have overcome the tedious and time-consuming process of manual analysis and anomaly counting; however, they often fall short in providing a complete characterization of road potholes. In this paper, we leverage transfer learning by adopting a pre-trained YOLOv8-seg model for the automatic characterization of potholes using digital images captured from a dashboard-mounted camera. Our work includes the creation of a novel dataset, comprising both images and their corresponding depth maps, collected from diverse road environments in Al-Khobar city and the KFUPM campus in Saudi Arabia. Our approach performs pothole detection and segmentation to precisely localize potholes and calculate their area. Subsequently, the segmented image is merged with its depth map to extract detailed depth information about the potholes. This integration of segmentation and depth data offers a more comprehensive characterization compared to previous deep learning-based road anomaly detection systems. Overall, this method not only has the potential to significantly enhance autonomous vehicle navigation by improving the detection and characterization of road hazards but also assists road maintenance authorities in responding more effectively to road damage.</p></details> |  | None |

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios.

Existing models often struggle with unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL (Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video. Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems.

In this study, we evaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including binary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting BVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an extensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample sizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting, and appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value, F1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently outperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest sensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023 herd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the number of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

Consequently, researchers have turned to synthetic methods for training data augmentation. However, existing synthetic strategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we introduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through Math-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality Estimator(SQE). By incorporating physical modeling of cracks, corrosion, and deformation, our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage (npcF++) further improves local fidelity using wavelet transforms and boundary synergy blocks. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To validate our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely adopted industrial anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD. Across these datasets, the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both image-AUROC and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of our MaPhC2F and BiSQAD.</p></details> |  | None |

The second makes use of a computationally light Euclidian distance approximation. Additionally, we open the first dataset showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response in a northern climate.

However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models. While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored, limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS, based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane, sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale, perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection.

Additionally, the defects do not reflect real-world characteristics. Therefore, we introduce the Heterogeneous Same-Sort Industrial Anomaly Detection (HSS-IAD) dataset, which contains 8,580 images of metallic-like industrial parts and precise anomaly annotations. These parts exhibit variations in structure and appearance, with subtle defects that closely resemble the base materials. We also provide foreground images for synthetic anomaly generation. Finally, we evaluate popular IAD methods on this dataset under multi-class and class-separated settings, demonstrating its potential to bridge the gap between existing datasets and real factory conditions.

While deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used for LAD, traditional machine learning (ML) techniques can also perform well depending on the context and dataset. Semi-supervised techniques deserve the same attention as they offer practical advantages over fully supervised methods. Current evaluations mainly focus on detection accuracy, but this alone is insufficient to determine the suitability of a technique for a given LAD task. Other aspects to consider include training and prediction times as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, which in practice matters to engineers. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating a wide range of supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques across four criteria: detection accuracy, time performance, and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning in both detection accuracy and time performance. The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML techniques fare similarly in terms of their detection accuracy and prediction time on most of the benchmark datasets considered in our study. Moreover, overall, sensitivity analysis to hyperparameter tuning with respect to detection accuracy shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive than deep learning techniques. Further, semi-supervised techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

Current datasets exhibit three fundamental limitations: (1) incomplete event coverage, (2) artificial patterns introduced by static analysis-based generation frameworks, and (3) insufficient semantic awareness. To address these challenges, we present AnomalyGen, the first automated log synthesis framework specifically designed for anomaly detection. Our framework introduces a novel four-phase architecture that integrates enhanced program analysis with Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT reasoning), enabling iterative log generation and anomaly annotation without requiring physical system execution. Evaluations on Hadoop and HDFS distributed systems demonstrate that AnomalyGen achieves substantially broader log event coverage (38-95 times improvement over existing datasets) while producing more operationally realistic log sequences compared to static analysis-based approaches. When augmenting benchmark datasets with synthesized logs, we observe maximum F1-score improvements of 3.7% (average 1.8% improvement across three state-of-the-art anomaly detection models). This work not only establishes a high-quality benchmarking resource for automated log analysis but also pioneers a new paradigm for applying large language models (LLMs) in software engineering workflows.</p></details> |  | None |

Microservice-based systems have gained significant attention over the past years. A critical factor for understanding and analyzing the behavior of these systems is the collection of monitoring data such as logs, metrics, and traces. These data modalities can be used for anomaly detection and root cause analysis of failures. In particular, multi-modal methods utilizing several types of this data at once have gained traction in the research community since these three modalities capture different dimensions of system behavior. Aim. We provide a dataset that supports research on anomaly detection and architectural degradation in microservice systems. We generate a comprehensive dataset of logs, metrics, and traces from a production microservice system to enable the exploration of multi-modal fusion methods that integrate multiple data modalities. Method. We dynamically tested the various APIs of the MS-based system, implementing the OAuth2.0 protocol using the Locust tool. For each execution of the prepared test suite, we collect logs and performance metrics for correct and erroneous calls with data labeled according to the error triggered during the call. Contributions. We collected approximately 657,000 individual log files, totaling over two billion log lines. In addition, we collected more than 45 million individual metric files that contain 485 unique metrics. We provide an initial analysis of logs, identify key metrics through PCA, and discuss challenges in collecting traces for this system. Moreover, we highlight the possibilities for making a more fine-grained version of the data set.

Traditional approaches, often constrained by hand-crafted features or domain-specific expert models, struggle to address this limitation, underscoring the need for a paradigm shift. We introduce AnomalyR1, a pioneering framework that leverages VLM-R1, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) renowned for its exceptional generalization and interpretability, to revolutionize IAD. By integrating MLLM with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enhanced by our novel Reasoned Outcome Alignment Metric (ROAM), AnomalyR1 achieves a fully end-to-end solution that autonomously processes inputs of image and domain knowledge, reasons through analysis, and generates precise anomaly localizations and masks. Based on the latest multimodal IAD benchmark, our compact 3-billion-parameter model outperforms existing methods, establishing state-of-the-art results. As MLLM capabilities continue to advance, this study is the first to deliver an end-to-end VLM-based IAD solution that demonstrates the transformative potential of ROAM-enhanced GRPO, positioning our framework as a forward-looking cornerstone for next-generation intelligent anomaly detection systems in industrial applications with limited defective data.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing approaches typically employ multi-modal foundation models combining language and vision modalities for prompt-guided anomaly detection, these methods often demand sophisticated prompt engineering and extensive manual tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate that a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD scenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential components: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and discriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support augmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to address the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature integration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency local details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual memory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection. Extensive evaluations across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD benchmarks demonstrate VisionAD's exceptional performance. Using only 1 normal images as support, our method achieves remarkable image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8% respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins (+1.6%, +3.2%, and +1.4%). The training-free nature and superior few-shot capabilities of VisionAD make it particularly appealing for real-world applications where samples are scarce or expensive to obtain.

Existing FSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts to align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language model paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic contextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships between different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting anomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt learning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer relations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware hierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on anomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships between arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message passing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual information, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to integrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the prediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on multi-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA datasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for image-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

However, current studies are hindered by steep computational costs due to the high-dimensional property of HSI and dense sampling-based training paradigm, constraining their rapid deployment. Our key observation is that, during training, not all samples within the same homogeneous area are indispensable, whereas ingenious sampling can provide a powerful substitute for reducing costs. Motivated by this, we propose an Asymmetrical Consensus State Space Model (ACMamba) to significantly reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Specifically, we design an asymmetrical anomaly detection paradigm that utilizes region-level instances as an efficient alternative to dense pixel-level samples. In this paradigm, a low-cost Mamba-based module is introduced to discover global contextual attributes of regions that are essential for HSI reconstruction. Additionally, we develop a consensus learning strategy from the optimization perspective to simultaneously facilitate background reconstruction and anomaly compression, further alleviating the negative impact of anomaly reconstruction. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify the superiority of ACMamba, demonstrating a faster speed and stronger performance over the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures | None |

In this work, we present a \textit{proactive} approach for time-series anomaly detection based on a time-series forecasting model specialized for anomaly detection and a data-driven anomaly detection model. Our proactive approach establishes an anomaly threshold from training data with a data-driven anomaly detection model, and anomalies are subsequently detected by identifying predicted values that exceed the anomaly threshold.

Our approach introduces minimal supervision into Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) through a two-stage training strategy: the model is first trained in an unsupervised manner on background data, and then fine-tuned using a small sample of labeled anomalies to encourage larger reconstruction errors for anomalous samples. We validate the method across diverse domains, including the MNIST dataset with synthetic anomalies, network intrusion data from the CICIDS benchmark, collider physics data from the LHCO2020 dataset, and simulated events from the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The latter provides a realistic example of subtle kinematic deviations in Higgs boson production. In all cases, the model demonstrates improved sensitivity to unseen anomalies, achieving better separation between normal and anomalous samples. These results indicate that even limited anomaly information, when incorporated through targeted fine-tuning, can substantially improve the generalization and performance of unsupervised models for anomaly detection.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures | None |

To counter this, we propose an adaptive real-time monitoring mechanism that detects abnormal thermal patterns in chip tiles. Our design space exploration helped identify key thermal features for an efficient anomaly detection module to be implemented at routers of network-enabled MPSoCs. To minimize hardware overhead, we employ weighted moving average (WMA) calculations and bit-shift operations, ensuring a lightweight yet effective implementation. By defining a spectrum of abnormal behaviors, our system successfully detects and mitigates malicious temperature fluctuations, reducing severe cases from 3.00{\deg}C to 1.9{\deg}C. The anomaly detection module achieves up to 82% of accuracy in detecting thermal attacks, which is only 10-15% less than top-performing machine learning (ML) models like Random Forest. However, our approach reduces hardware usage by up to 75% for logic resources and 100% for specialized resources, making it significantly more efficient than ML-based solutions. This method provides a practical, low-cost solution for resource-constrained environments, ensuring resilience against thermal attacks while maintaining system performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, | None |

Traditional AD methods typically require the availability of normal training samples; however, this assumption is not always feasible, as collecting such data can be impractical. Additionally, these methods often struggle to generalize across different domains. Recent advancements, such as AnomalyCLIP and AdaCLIP, utilize the zero-shot generalization capabilities of CLIP but still face a performance gap between image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that conditions the prompts of the text encoder based on image context extracted from the vision encoder. Also, to capture fine-grained variations more effectively, we have modified the CLIP vision encoder and altered the extraction of dense features. These changes ensure that the features retain richer spatial and structural information for both normal and anomalous prompts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving performance by 2% to 29% across different metrics on 14 datasets.

To address this challenge, we propose an Anatomy-driven self-supervised framework for enhancing Fine-grained Representation in radiographic image analysis (AFiRe). The core idea of AFiRe is to align the anatomical consistency with the unique token-processing characteristics of Vision Transformer. Specifically, AFiRe synergistically performs two self-supervised schemes: (i) Token-wise anatomy-guided contrastive learning, which aligns image tokens based on structural and categorical consistency, thereby enhancing fine-grained spatial-anatomical discrimination; (ii) Pixel-level anomaly-removal restoration, which particularly focuses on local anomalies, thereby refining the learned discrimination with detailed geometrical information. Additionally, we propose Synthetic Lesion Mask to enhance anatomical diversity while preserving intra-consistency, which is typically corrupted by traditional data augmentations, such as Cropping and Affine transformations. Experimental results show that AFiRe: (i) provides robust anatomical discrimination, achieving more cohesive feature clusters compared to state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods; (ii) demonstrates superior generalization, surpassing 7 radiography-specific self-supervised methods in multi-label classification tasks with limited labeling; and (iii) integrates fine-grained information, enabling precise anomaly detection using only image-level annotations.</p></details> |  | None |

While semi-supervised methods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer from high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection. However, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder real-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways in human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that integrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these limitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly confidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than the entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM for elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to domain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal patterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs. During inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts for anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast and slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively combines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable detection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications with high reliability requirements.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work we investigate the statistical relationship between inpainted brain structures and the amount of subject-specific conditioning information, i.e. the other areas of the image that are masked. In particular, we analyse the distribution of inpainting results when masking additional regions of the image, specifically the contra-lateral structure. This allows us to elucidate where in the brain the model is drawing information from, and in particular, what is the importance of hemispherical symmetry? Our experiments interrogate a diffusion inpainting model through analysing the inpainting of subcortical brain structures based on intensity and estimated area change. We demonstrate that some structures show a strong influence of symmetry in the conditioning of the inpainting process.</p></details> |  | None |

Log-based anomaly detection has become a key research area that aims to identify system issues through log data, ultimately enhancing the reliability of software systems. Traditional deep learning methods often struggle to capture the semantic information embedded in log data, which is typically organized in natural language. In this paper, we propose LogLLM, a log-based anomaly detection framework that leverages large language models (LLMs). LogLLM employs BERT for extracting semantic vectors from log messages, while utilizing Llama, a transformer decoder-based model, for classifying log sequences. Additionally, we introduce a projector to align the vector representation spaces of BERT and Llama, ensuring a cohesive understanding of log semantics. Unlike conventional methods that require log parsers to extract templates, LogLLM preprocesses log messages with regular expressions, streamlining the entire process. Our framework is trained through a novel three-stage procedure designed to enhance performance and adaptability. Experimental results across four public datasets demonstrate that LogLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Even when handling unstable logs, it effectively captures the semantic meaning of log messages and detects anomalies accurately.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces MADLLM, a novel multivariate anomaly detection method via pre-trained LLMs. We design a new triple encoding technique to align the MTS modality with the text modality of LLMs. Specifically, this technique integrates the traditional patch embedding method with two novel embedding approaches: Skip Embedding, which alters the order of patch processing in traditional methods to help LLMs retain knowledge of previous features, and Feature Embedding, which leverages contrastive learning to allow the model to better understand the correlations between different features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various public anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo 2025 (ICME 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, the physical layer communications in the LAENet face growing security threats due to inherent characteristics of aerial communication environments, such as signal broadcast nature and channel openness. These challenges highlight the urgent need for safeguarding communication confidentiality, availability, and integrity. In view of the above, this survey comprehensively reviews existing secure countermeasures for physical layer communication in the LAENet. We explore core methods focusing on anti-eavesdropping and authentication for ensuring communication confidentiality. Subsequently, availability-enhancing techniques are thoroughly discussed for anti-jamming and spoofing defense. Then, we review approaches for safeguarding integrity through anomaly detection and injection protection. Furthermore, we discuss future research directions, emphasizing energy-efficient physical layer security, multi-drone collaboration for secure communication, AI-driven security defense strategy, space-air-ground integrated security architecture, and 6G-enabled secure UAV communication.

Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD) is the most representative technique used in different systems for attack detection and safety guarantee, where multiple LAD methods and relevant datasets have been proposed. However, even though some of these datasets are specifically prepared for cloud systems, they only cover limited cloud behaviors and lack information from a whole-system perspective. Besides, another critical issue to consider is normality shift, which implies the test distribution could differ from the training distribution and highly affects the performance of LAD. Unfortunately, existing works only focus on simple shift types such as chronological changes, while other important and cloud-specific shift types are ignored, e.g., the distribution shift introduced by different deployed cloud architectures. Therefore, creating a new dataset that covers diverse behaviors of cloud systems and normality shift types is necessary. To fill the gap in evaluating LAD under real-world conditions, we present CAShift, the first normality shift-aware dataset for cloud systems. CAShift captures three shift types, including application, version, and cloud architecture shifts, and includes 20 diverse attack scenarios across various cloud components. Using CAShift, we conduct an empirical study showing that (1) all LAD methods are significantly affected by normality shifts, with performance drops of up to 34%, and (2) continuous learning techniques can improve F1-scores by up to 27%, depending on data usage and algorithm choice. Based on our findings, we offer valuable implications for future research in designing more robust LAD models and methods for LAD shift adaptation.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 | None |
| **[A Self-Supervised Framework for Space Object Behaviour Characterisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06176v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models, pre-trained on large unlabelled datasets before task-specific fine-tuning, are increasingly being applied to specialised domains. Recent examples include ClimaX for climate and Clay for satellite Earth observation, but a Foundation Model for Space Object Behavioural Analysis has not yet been developed. As orbital populations grow, automated methods for characterising space object behaviour are crucial for space safety. We present a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction, and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection & motion prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%, identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90 and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic object profiles and satellite glinting. Here, we demonstrate how self-supervised learning can simultaneously enable anomaly detection, motion prediction, and synthetic data generation from rich representations learned in pre-training. Our work therefore supports space safety and sustainability through automated monitoring and simulation capabilities.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures | None |

In radar imaging, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), anomaly detection can be used for the classification, detection, and segmentation of objects of interest. However, there is no method for developing and benchmarking these methods on SAR imagery. To address this issue, we introduce SAR imagery anomaly detection (SARIAD). In conjunction with Anomalib, a deep-learning library for anomaly detection, SARIAD provides a comprehensive suite of algorithms and datasets for assessing and developing anomaly detection approaches on SAR imagery. SARIAD specifically integrates multiple SAR datasets along with tools to effectively apply various anomaly detection algorithms to SAR imagery. Several anomaly detection metrics and visualizations are available.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> | None |

In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates \textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach. By combining multi-scale feature extraction with automatic relative association modeling, AMAD provides a robust and adaptable solution to UMTSAD challenges. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieving competitive performance results compared to SOTA benchmarks across a variety of datasets.</p></details> | fix img issues | None |

Supervision failures can occur if LLMs are sensitive to factors that supervisors are unaware of. We investigate Mechanistic Anomaly Detection (MAD) as a technique to augment supervision of capable models; we use internal model features to identify anomalous training signals so they can be investigated or discarded. We train detectors to flag points from the test environment that differ substantially from the training environment, and experiment with a large variety of detector features and scoring rules to detect anomalies in a set of ``quirky'' language models. We find that detectors can achieve high discrimination on some tasks, but no detector is effective across all models and tasks. MAD techniques may be effective in low-stakes applications, but advances in both detection and evaluation are likely needed if they are to be used in high stakes settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR Building Trust Workshop 2025</p></details> | None |

As this survey of recent results attempts to show, bringing multivariate extreme value theory and statistical learning theory together in a common, non-parametric and non-asymptotic framework makes it possible to design and analyze new methods for exploiting the scarce information located in distribution tails in these purposes. This article reviews recently proved theoretical tools for establishing guarantees for supervised or unsupervised algorithms learning from a fraction of extreme data. These are mainly exponential maximal deviation inequalities tailored to low-probability regions and concentration results for stochastic processes empirically describing the behavior of extreme observations, their dependence structure in particular. Under appropriate assumptions of regular variation, several illustrative applications are then examined: classification, regression, anomaly detection, model selection via cross-validation. For these, generalization results are established inspired by the classical bounds in statistical learning theory. In the same spirit, it is also shown how to adapt the popular high-dimensional lasso technique in the context of extreme values for the covariates with generalization guarantees.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous work has verified the efficacy of symbolic time series representation in a variety of engineering applications due to its storage efficiency and numerosity reduction. The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique, ABBA, has been shown to preserve essential shape information of time series and improve downstream applications, e.g., neural network inference regarding prediction and anomaly detection in time series. Motivated by the emergence of high-performance hardware which enables efficient computation for low bit-width representations, we present a new quantization-based ABBA symbolic approximation technique, QABBA, which exhibits improved storage efficiency while retaining the original speed and accuracy of symbolic reconstruction. We prove an upper bound for the error arising from quantization and discuss how the number of bits should be chosen to balance this with other errors. An application of QABBA with large language models (LLMs) for time series regression is also presented, and its utility is investigated. By representing the symbolic chain of patterns on time series, QABBA not only avoids the training of embedding from scratch, but also achieves a new state-of-the-art on Monash regression dataset. The symbolic approximation to the time series offers a more efficient way to fine-tune LLMs on the time series regression task which contains various application domains. We further present a set of extensive experiments performed across various well-established datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the QABBA method for symbolic approximation.</p></details> |  | None |

Besides merely detecting if a product is anomalous or not, it is crucial to know the distinct type of defect, such as a bent, cut, or scratch. The ability to recognize the "exact" defect type enables automated treatments of the anomalies in modern production lines. Current methods are limited to solely detecting whether a product is defective or not without providing any insights on the defect type, nevertheless detecting and identifying multiple defects. We propose MultiADS, a zero-shot learning approach, able to perform Multi-type Anomaly Detection and Segmentation. The architecture of MultiADS comprises CLIP and extra linear layers to align the visual- and textual representation in a joint feature space. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal, is the first approach to perform a multi-type anomaly segmentation task in zero-shot learning. Contrary to the other baselines, our approach i) generates specific anomaly masks for each distinct defect type, ii) learns to distinguish defect types, and iii) simultaneously identifies multiple defect types present in an anomalous product. Additionally, our approach outperforms zero/few-shot learning SoTA methods on image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection and segmentation tasks on five commonly used datasets: MVTec-AD, Visa, MPDD, MAD and Real-IAD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UMGAD: Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12556v4)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a critical task in graph machine learning, with the primary objective of identifying anomalous nodes that deviate significantly from the majority. This task is widely applied in various real-world scenarios, including fraud detection and social network analysis. However, existing GAD methods still face two major challenges: (1) They are often limited to detecting anomalies in single-type interaction graphs and struggle with multiple interaction types in multiplex heterogeneous graphs. (2) In unsupervised scenarios, selecting appropriate anomaly score thresholds remains a significant challenge for accurate anomaly detection. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection method, named UMGAD. We first learn multi-relational correlations among nodes in multiplex heterogeneous graphs and capture anomaly information during node attribute and structure reconstruction through graph-masked autoencoder (GMAE). Then, to further extract abnormal information, we generate attribute-level and subgraph-level augmented-view graphs, respectively, and perform attribute and structure reconstruction through GMAE. Finally, we learn to optimize node attributes and structural features through contrastive learning between original-view and augmented-view graphs to improve the model's ability to capture anomalies. Meanwhile, we propose a new anomaly score threshold selection strategy, which allows the model to be independent of ground truth information in real unsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that our UMGAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 12.25% in AUC and 11.29% in Macro-F1 across all datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Big Data Research journal</p></details> | None |

However, manually selecting standard frames is time-consuming and prone to intra- and inter-sonographer variability. Existing methods primarily rely on image-based approaches that capture standard frames and then classify the input frames across different anatomies. This ignores the dynamic nature of video acquisition and its interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Tier Class-Aware Token Transformer (MCAT), a visual query-based video clip localization (VQ-VCL) method, to assist sonographers by enabling them to capture a quick US sweep. By then providing a visual query of the anatomy they wish to analyze, MCAT returns the video clip containing the standard frames for that anatomy, facilitating thorough screening for potential anomalies. We evaluate MCAT on two ultrasound video datasets and a natural image VQ-VCL dataset based on Ego4D. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% and 13% mIoU on the ultrasound datasets and by 5.35% mIoU on the Ego4D dataset, using 96% fewer tokens. MCAT's efficiency and accuracy have significant potential implications for public health, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it may enhance prenatal care by streamlining standard plane acquisition, simplifying US-based screening, diagnosis and allowing sonographers to examine more patients.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhanced Anomaly Detection for Capsule Endoscopy Using Ensemble Learning Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06039v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capsule endoscopy is a method to capture images of the gastrointestinal tract and screen for diseases which might remain hidden if investigated with standard endoscopes. Due to the limited size of a video capsule, embedding AI models directly into the capsule demands careful consideration of the model size and thus complicates anomaly detection in this field. Furthermore, the scarcity of available data in this domain poses an ongoing challenge to achieving effective anomaly detection. Thus, this work introduces an ensemble strategy to address this challenge in anomaly detection tasks in video capsule endoscopies, requiring only a small number of individual neural networks during both the training and inference phases. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple independently trained neural networks. This has shown to be highly effective in enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models. However, this comes at the cost of higher memory usage and increased computational effort, which quickly becomes prohibitive in many real-world applications. Instead of applying the same training algorithm to each individual network, we propose using various loss functions, drawn from the anomaly detection field, to train each network. The methods are validated on the two largest publicly available datasets for video capsule endoscopy images, the Galar and the Kvasir-Capsule dataset. We achieve an AUC score of 76.86% on the Kvasir-Capsule and an AUC score of 76.98% on the Galar dataset. Our approach outperforms current baselines with significantly fewer parameters across all models, which is a crucial step towards incorporating artificial intelligence into capsule endoscopies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS EMBC)</p></details> | None |

However, existing spectral analysis techniques face challenges, particularly when relying on pre-defined, physics-based calculations to process large volumes of noisy and complex observational data. To address these limitations, we applied deep learning to detect anomalies in the Stokes V spectra from the Hinode/SP instrument. Specifically, we developed an autoencoder model for spectral compression, which serves as an anomaly detection method. Our model effectively identifies anomalous spectra within spectro-polarimetric maps captured prior to the onset of the X1.3 flare on May 5, 2024, in NOAA AR 13663. These atypical spectral points exhibit highly complex profiles and spatially align with polarity inversion lines in magnetogram images, indicating their potential as sites of magnetic energy storage and possible triggers for flares. Notably, the detected anomalies are highly localized, making them particularly challenging to identify in magnetogram images using current manual methods.</p></details> |  | None |

These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution. The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired consistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens the resilience of cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  | None |

To address the classification bias caused by class imbalance, we introduce variational inference optimization probability modeling, which enables the model to adaptively adjust the representation ability of minority classes and combines the class-aware weight adjustment strategy to enhance the classifier's sensitivity to minority classes. In addition, we combine the adversarial learning mechanism to generate minority class samples in the latent space so that the model can better characterize the category boundary in the high-dimensional feature space. The experiment is evaluated on the Kaggle "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset and compared with a variety of advanced imbalanced classification methods (such as GAN-based sampling, BRF, XGBoost-Cost Sensitive, SAAD, HAN). The results show that the method in this study has achieved the best performance in AUC, Precision, Recall and F1-score indicators, effectively improving the recognition rate of minority classes and reducing the false alarm rate. This method can be widely used in imbalanced classification tasks such as financial fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection, providing a new solution for related research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models via Direct Latent Likelihood Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05662v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, with their robust distribution approximation capabilities, have demonstrated excellent performance in anomaly detection. However, conventional reconstruction-based approaches rely on computing the reconstruction error between the original and denoised images, which requires careful noise-strength tuning and over ten network evaluations per input-leading to significantly slower detection speeds. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based anomaly detection method that circumvents the need for resource-intensive reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing the input image, we directly infer its corresponding latent variables and measure their density under the Gaussian prior distribution. Remarkably, the prior density proves effective as an anomaly score even when using a short partial diffusion process of only 2-5 steps. We evaluate our method on the MVTecAD dataset, achieving an AUC of 0.991 at 15 FPS, thereby setting a new state-of-the-art speed-AUC anomaly detection trade-off.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/SkyShunsuke/InversionAD</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SkyShunsuke/InversionAD) |

To capture complex motion effectively, we utilize the First Order Motion Model (FOMM), which encodes dynamic objects by detecting keypoints and their associated local affine transformations. These keypoints are identified using a self-supervised keypoint detector and arranged into a time series corresponding to the successive frames. Forecasting is performed on these keypoints by integrating two advanced generative time series models into the motion transfer pipeline, namely the Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit with Normalizing Flow (GRU-NF). The predicted keypoints are subsequently synthesized into realistic video frames using an optical flow estimator paired with a generator network, thereby facilitating accurate video forecasting and enabling efficient, low-frame-rate video transmission. We validate our results across three datasets for video animation and reconstruction using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture Embedding Distance, Structural Similarity Index, and Average Pair-wise Displacement. Our results confirm that by utilizing the superior reconstruction property of the Variational Autoencoder, the VRNN integrated FOMM excels in applications involving multi-step ahead forecasts such as video conferencing. On the other hand, by leveraging the Normalizing Flow architecture for exact likelihood estimation, and enabling efficient latent space sampling, the GRU-NF based FOMM exhibits superior capabilities for producing diverse future samples while maintaining high visual quality for tasks like real-time video-based anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LLM meets ML: Data-efficient Anomaly Detection on Unseen Unstable Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07467v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for ULAD, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points in F1 score while using 62.87 percentage points less labeled data. When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 percentage points increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.</p></details> |  | None |

We consider classical detection schemes that rely on signals recorded on a moving sensor, and modeling of the source as a function of unknown parameters. As the usual spherical harmonic decomposition of the anomaly has to be truncated in practice, we study the signal vector subspaces induced by each multipole of the decomposition, proving they are not in direct sum, and discussing the impact it has on the choice of the truncation order. Further, to ease the detection strategy based on generalized likelihood ratio test, we rely on orthogonal polynomials theory to derive an analytical set of orthonormal functions (multipolar orthonormal basis functions) that spans the space of the noise-free measured signal. Finally, based on the subspace structure of the multipole vector spaces, we study the impact of the truncation order on the detection performance, beyond the issue of potential surparametrization, and the behaviour of the information criteria used to choose this order.</p></details> |  | None |

In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as 'anomalies'. To learn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned 'normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose IterMask3D, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks 'normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of 'normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Traditional log parsing techniques often require manual configurations, such as defining log formats or labeling data, which limits scalability and usability. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing, offering potential improvements in automation and adaptability. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of these approaches since this is a relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This paper systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods, comparing their capabilities, limitations, and reliance on manual effort. We analyze the learning and prompt-engineering paradigms employed, efficiency- and effectiveness-enhancing techniques, and the role of LLMs in the parsing process. We aggregate the results of the survey in a large table comprising the characterizing features of LLM-based log parsing approaches and derive the general process of LLM-based log parsing, incorporating all reviewed approaches in a single flow chart. Additionally, we benchmark seven open-source LLM-based log parsers on public datasets and critically assess their reproducibility. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field and provide insights for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and user-friendly log parsing solutions, with all code and results made publicly available for transparency.</p></details> | 34 pages, 11 figures | None |

Uncovering LLM's Capabilities in Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09654v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language. Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MM'24 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

However, current methods lack adaptation to data distribution shifts in both temporal and spatial dimensions as cyber-physical systems evolve. To tackle this issue, we propose an incremental meta-learning-based approach, namely iADCPS, which can continuously update the model through limited evolving normal samples to reconcile the distribution gap between evolving and historical time series. Specifically, We first introduce a temporal mixup strategy to align data for data-level generalization which is then combined with the one-class meta-learning approach for model-level generalization. Furthermore, we develop a non-parametric dynamic threshold to adaptively adjust the threshold based on the probability density of the abnormal scores without any anomaly supervision. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the iADCPS using three publicly available datasets PUMP, SWaT, and WADI. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 99.0%, 93.1%, and 78.7% F1-Score, respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ADCPS method, especially in the context of the evolving CPSs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most systems remain black boxes, lacking explainability during training and inference. A key challenge is integrating explicit knowledge into implicit models to create expert-driven, interpretable VAD systems. This paper introduces Rule-based Violence Monitoring (RuleVM), a novel weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WVAD) paradigm. RuleVM employs a dual-branch architecture: an implicit branch using visual features for coarse-grained binary classification, with feature extraction split into scene frames and action channels, and an explicit branch leveraging language-image alignment for fine-grained classification. The explicit branch utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model for object detection in video frames, with association rules mined from data as video descriptors. This design enables interpretable coarse- and fine-grained violence monitoring. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks show RuleVM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both granularities. Notably, it reveals rules like increased violence risk with crowd size.

Most existing works shine at industrial anomaly generation with multiple specialists or large generative models, rarely generalizing to anomalies in other applications. In this paper, we present AnomalyHybrid, a domain-agnostic framework designed to generate authentic and diverse anomalies simply by combining the reference and target images. AnomalyHybrid is a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)-based framework having two decoders that integrate the appearance of reference image into the depth and edge structures of target image respectively. With the help of depth decoders, AnomalyHybrid achieves authentic generation especially for the anomalies with depth values changing, such a s protrusion and dent. More, it relaxes the fine granularity structural control of the edge decoder and brings more diversity. Without using annotations, AnomalyHybrid is easily trained with sets of color, depth and edge of same images having different augmentations. Extensive experiments carried on HeliconiusButterfly, MVTecAD and MVTec3D datasets demonstrate that AnomalyHybrid surpasses the GAN-based state-of-the-art on anomaly generation and its downstream anomaly classification, detection and segmentation tasks. On MVTecAD dataset, AnomalyHybrid achieves 2.06/0.32 IS/LPIPS for anomaly generation, 52.6 Acc for anomaly classification with ResNet34, 97.3/72.9 AP for image/pixel-level anomaly detection with a simple UNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 workshop on Harnessing Generative Models for Synthetic Visual Datasets (SyntaGen)</p></details> | None |

However, collecting normal and attack data in ICS environments is challenging due to the scarcity of testbeds and the high cost of human expertise. Existing datasets are often limited by the domain expertise of practitioners, making the process costly and inefficient. The lack of comprehensive attack pattern data poses a significant problem for developing robust anomaly detection methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines data-centric and design-centric methodologies to generate attack patterns using large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate that the attack patterns generated by LLMs not only surpass the quality and quantity of those created by human experts but also offer a scalable solution that does not rely on expensive testbeds or pre-existing attack examples. This multi-agent based approach presents a promising avenue for enhancing the security and resilience of ICS environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Overcoming the Identity Mapping Problem in Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04115v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge of deep learning has catalyzed considerable progress in self-supervised Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD). The core premise for self-supervised HAD is that anomalous pixels are inherently more challenging to reconstruct, resulting in larger errors compared to the background. However, owing to the powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities of neural networks, self-supervised models often suffer from the Identity Mapping Problem (IMP). The IMP manifests as a tendency for the model to overfit to the entire image, particularly with increasing network complexity or prolonged training iterations. Consequently, the whole image can be precisely reconstructed, and even the anomalous pixels exhibit imperceptible errors, making them difficult to detect. Despite the proposal of several models aimed at addressing the IMP-related issues, a unified descriptive framework and validation of solutions for IMP remain lacking. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth exploration to IMP, and summarize a unified framework that describes IMP from the perspective of network optimization, which encompasses three aspects: perturbation, reconstruction, and regularization. Correspondingly, we introduce three solutions: superpixel pooling and uppooling for perturbation, error-adaptive convolution for reconstruction, and online background pixel mining for regularization. With extensive experiments being conducted to validate the effectiveness, it is hoped that our work will provide valuable insights and inspire further research for self-supervised HAD.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art pre-trained foundation models, introducing a novel taxonomy to categorize them across several dimensions. Specifically, we classify models by their architecture design, distinguishing between those leveraging patch-based representations and those operating directly on raw sequences. The taxonomy further includes whether the models provide probabilistic or deterministic predictions, and whether they are designed to work with univariate time series or can handle multivariate time series out of the box. Additionally, the taxonomy encompasses model scale and complexity, highlighting differences between lightweight architectures and large-scale foundation models. A unique aspect of this survey is its categorization by the type of objective function employed during training phase. By synthesizing these perspectives, this survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and identifying promising directions for future research in transformer-based time series modeling.</p></details> |  | None |

Data-driven methods like CATHODE accomplish this by training separate generative models on the complement of each signal region, and interpolating them into their corresponding signal regions. Having to re-train the generative model on essentially the entire dataset for each signal region is a major computational cost in a typical sliding window search with many signal regions. Here, we present SIGMA, a new, fully data-driven, computationally-efficient method for estimating background distributions. The idea is to train a single generative model on all of the data and interpolate its parameters in sideband regions in order to obtain a model for the background in the signal region. The SIGMA method significantly reduces the computational cost compared to previous approaches, while retaining a similar high quality of background modeling and sensitivity to anomalous signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, v2: added timing comparison and sample quality in other SRs</p></details> | None |

To ensure uninterrupted operation of these machines, thousands of pieces of equipment need to be synchronized, which requires addressing many challenges including design, optimization and control, anomaly detection and machine protection. With recent advancements, Machine Learning (ML) holds promise to assist in more advance prognostics, optimization, and control. While ML based solutions have been developed for several applications in particle accelerators, only few have reached deployment and even fewer to long term usage, due to particle accelerator data distribution drifts caused by changes in both measurable and non-measurable parameters. In this paper, we identify some of the key areas within particle accelerators where continual learning can allow maintenance of ML model performance with distribution drifts. Particularly, we first discuss existing applications of ML in particle accelerators, and their limitations due to distribution drift. Next, we review existing continual learning techniques and investigate their potential applications to address data distribution drifts in accelerators.

| **[Improving log-based anomaly detection through learned adaptive filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02994v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log messages record important system runtime information and are useful for detecting anomalous behaviors and managing modern software systems. Many supervised and unsupervised learning methods have been proposed recently for log-based anomaly detection. State-of-the-art unsupervised methods predict the next log event given a log sequence and apply fixed configurations that use the same filter condition (i.e. k, the top k predicted log events will be regarded as normal next events) which leads to inferior performance in the detection stage because it sets one fixed k for all log sequences, which ignores the dynamic nature and variance in different log sequences. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are widely applied to make intelligent decisions in a dynamic environment. In this work, we contend that it is necessary to apply adaptive filters for different log sequences. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach based on DRL to construct a learned adaptive filter and apply different normal/abnormal filter thresholds for different log sequences. We define the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and formulate the learned adaptive filter as a problem that can be solved by DRL. We evaluate the learned adaptive filter on two state-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection unsupervised approaches DeepLog and LogAnomaly in two datasets HDFS and BGL. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the fixed configurations and achieves significantly better performance in log-based anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

We observe that existing models suffer from tail-versus-noise trade-off where if a model is robust against pixel noise, then its performance deteriorates on tail class samples, and vice versa. To mitigate the issue, we handle the tail class and noise samples independently. To this end, we propose TailSampler, a novel class size predictor that estimates the class cardinality of samples based on a symmetric assumption on the class-wise distribution of embedding similarities. TailSampler can be utilized to sample the tail class samples exclusively, allowing to handle them separately. Based on these facets, we build a memory-based anomaly detection model TailedCore, whose memory both well captures tail class information and is noise-robust. We extensively validate the effectiveness of TailedCore on the unsupervised long-tail noisy anomaly detection setting, and show that TailedCore outperforms the state-of-the-art in most settings.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 | None |

Modern neural networks have outstanding ability in modeling complex time series. Self-supervised models in particular tackle unsupervised TSAD by transforming the input via various augmentations to create pseudo anomalies for training. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of augmentation, which is hard to choose in practice, while there exists no effort in the literature on data augmentation tuning for TSAD without labels. Our work aims to fill this gap. We introduce TSAP for TSA "on autoPilot", which can (self-)tune augmentation hyperparameters end-to-end. It stands on two key components: a differentiable augmentation architecture and an unsupervised validation loss to effectively assess the alignment between augmentation type and anomaly type. Case studies show TSAP's ability to effectively select the (discrete) augmentation type and associated (continuous) hyperparameters. In turn, it outperforms established baselines, including SOTA self-supervised models, on diverse TSAD tasks exhibiting different anomaly types.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 | None |
| **[Analytical Discovery of Manifold with Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02511v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding low-dimensional structures within high-dimensional data is crucial for visualization, interpretation, and denoising in complex datasets. Despite the advancements in manifold learning techniques, key challenges-such as limited global insight and the lack of interpretable analytical descriptions-remain unresolved. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, GAMLA (Global Analytical Manifold Learning using Auto-encoding). GAMLA employs a two-round training process within an auto-encoding framework to derive both character and complementary representations for the underlying manifold. With the character representation, the manifold is represented by a parametric function which unfold the manifold to provide a global coordinate. While with the complementary representation, an approximate explicit manifold description is developed, offering a global and analytical representation of smooth manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets. This enables the analytical derivation of geometric properties such as curvature and normal vectors. Moreover, we find the two representations together decompose the whole latent space and can thus characterize the local spatial structure surrounding the manifold, proving particularly effective in anomaly detection and categorization. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world applications, GAMLA demonstrates its ability to achieve computational efficiency and interpretability while providing precise geometric and structural insights. This framework bridges the gap between data-driven manifold learning and analytical geometry, presenting a versatile tool for exploring the intrinsic properties of complex data sets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ZClip: Adaptive Spike Mitigation for LLM Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02507v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) presents numerous challenges, including gradient instability and loss spikes. These phenomena can lead to catastrophic divergence, requiring costly checkpoint restoration and data batch skipping. Traditional gradient clipping techniques, such as constant or norm-based methods, fail to address these issues effectively due to their reliance on fixed thresholds or heuristics, leading to inefficient learning and requiring frequent manual intervention. In this work, we propose ZClip, an adaptive gradient clipping algorithm that dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on statistical properties of gradient norms over time. Unlike prior reactive strategies, ZClip proactively adapts to training dynamics without making any prior assumptions on the scale and the temporal evolution of gradient norms. At its core, it leverages z-score-based anomaly detection to identify and mitigate large gradient spikes, preventing malignant loss spikes while not interfering with convergence otherwise.

| **[VISTA: Unsupervised 2D Temporal Dependency Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02498v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is essential for uncovering rare and potentially harmful events in unlabeled time series data. Existing methods are highly dependent on clean, high-quality inputs, making them susceptible to noise and real-world imperfections. Additionally, intricate temporal relationships in time series data are often inadequately captured in traditional 1D representations, leading to suboptimal modeling of dependencies. We introduce VISTA, a training-free, unsupervised TSAD algorithm designed to overcome these challenges. VISTA features three core modules: 1) Time Series Decomposition using Seasonal and Trend Decomposition via Loess (STL) to decompose noisy time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components; 2) Temporal Self-Attention, which transforms 1D time series into 2D temporal correlation matrices for richer dependency modeling and anomaly detection; and 3) Multivariate Temporal Aggregation, which uses a pretrained feature extractor to integrate cross-variable information into a unified, memory-efficient representation. VISTA's training-free approach enables rapid deployment and easy hyperparameter tuning, making it suitable for industrial applications. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on five multivariate TSAD benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08628v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data. Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance. Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite advances in anomaly detection, existing systems often fall short in areas such as post-detection validation, scalability, and effective maintenance. These limitations not only hinder the detection of new threats but also impair overall system performance. To address these challenges, we propose CEDLog, a novel practical framework that integrates Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for continual learning and implements distributed computing for scalable processing by integrating Apache Airflow and Dask. In CEDLog, anomalies are detected through the synthesis of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) using critical features present in event logs. Through comparisons with update strategies on large-scale datasets, we demonstrate the strengths of CEDLog, showcasing efficient updates and low false positives</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems</p></details> | None |

Thus we propose CRC-SGAD, a framework integrating statistical risk control into GAD via two innovations: (1) A Dual-Threshold Conformal Risk Control mechanism that provides theoretically guaranteed bounds for both False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) through providing prediction sets; (2) A Subgraph-aware Spectral Graph Neural Calibrator (SSGNC) that optimizes node representations through adaptive spectral filtering while reducing the size of prediction sets via hybrid loss optimization. Experiments on four datasets and five GAD models demonstrate statistically significant improvements in FNR and FPR control and prediction set size. CRC-SGAD establishes a paradigm for statistically rigorous anomaly detection in graph-structured security applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the unstructured nature and ever-growing scale of these logs present significant challenges for manual analysis and automated downstream tasks such as anomaly detection. Log parsing addresses these challenges by converting raw logs into structured formats, enabling efficient log analysis. Despite its importance, existing log parsing methods suffer from limitations in efficiency and scalability, due to the large size of log data and their heterogeneous formats. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a log parsing approach, LogLSHD, which leverages Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to group similar logs and integrates Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to enhance the accuracy of template extraction. LogLSHD demonstrates exceptional efficiency in parsing time, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. For example, compared to Drain, LogLSHD reduces the average parsing time by 73% while increasing the average parsing accuracy by 15% on the LogHub 2.0 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 21st International Conference on Predictive Models and Data Analytics in Software Engineering (PROMISE 2025)</p></details> | None |

| **[Anomaly Detection for Hybrid Butterfly Subspecies via Probability Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01671v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting butterfly hybrids requires knowledge of the parent subspecies, and the process can be tedious when encountering a new subspecies. This study focuses on a specific scenario where a model trained to recognize hybrid species A can generalize to species B when B biologically mimics A. Since species A and B share similar patterns, we leverage BioCLIP as our feature extractor to capture features based on their taxonomy. Consequently, the algorithm designed for species A can be transferred to B, as their hybrid and non-hybrid patterns exhibit similar relationships. To determine whether a butterfly is a hybrid, we adopt proposed probability filtering and color jittering to augment and simulate the mimicry. With these approaches, we achieve second place in the official development phase.

| **[Dinomaly: The Less Is More Philosophy in Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14325v5)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies highlighted a practical setting of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) that builds a unified model for multi-class images. Despite various advancements addressing this challenging task, the detection performance under the multi-class setting still lags far behind state-of-the-art class-separated models. Our research aims to bridge this substantial performance gap. In this paper, we introduce a minimalistic reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework, namely Dinomaly, which leverages pure Transformer architectures without relying on complex designs, additional modules, or specialized tricks. Given this powerful framework consisted of only Attentions and MLPs, we found four simple components that are essential to multi-class anomaly detection: (1) Foundation Transformers that extracts universal and discriminative features, (2) Noisy Bottleneck where pre-existing Dropouts do all the noise injection tricks, (3) Linear Attention that naturally cannot focus, and (4) Loose Reconstruction that does not force layer-to-layer and point-by-point reconstruction. Extensive experiments are conducted across popular anomaly detection benchmarks including MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD. Our proposed Dinomaly achieves impressive image-level AUROC of 99.6%, 98.7%, and 89.3% on the three datasets respectively, which is not only superior to state-of-the-art multi-class UAD methods, but also achieves the most advanced class-separated UAD records.</p></details> | IEEE/CVF CVPR 2025 | None |
| **[Detecting Localized Density Anomalies in Multivariate Data via Coin-Flip Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23927v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting localized density differences in multivariate data is a crucial task in computational science. Such anomalies can indicate a critical system failure, lead to a groundbreaking scientific discovery, or reveal unexpected changes in data distribution. We introduce EagleEye, an anomaly detection method to compare two multivariate datasets with the aim of identifying local density anomalies, namely over- or under-densities affecting only localised regions of the feature space. Anomalies are detected by modelling, for each point, the ordered sequence of its neighbours' membership label as a coin-flipping process and monitoring deviations from the expected behaviour of such process. A unique advantage of our method is its ability to provide an accurate, entirely unsupervised estimate of the local signal purity. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In synthetic data, EagleEye accurately detects anomalies in multiple dimensions even when they affect a tiny fraction of the data. When applied to a challenging resonant anomaly detection benchmark task in simulated Large Hadron Collider data, EagleEye successfully identifies particle decay events present in just 0.3% of the dataset. In global temperature data, EagleEye uncovers previously unidentified, geographically localised changes in temperature fields that occurred in the most recent years. Thanks to its key advantages of conceptual simplicity, computational efficiency, trivial parallelisation, and scalability, EagleEye is widely applicable across many fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code Availability: The code used to generate the results of this study is available at GitHub via the link: https://github.com/sspring137/EagleEye</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/sspring137/EagleEye) |
| **[Fault injection analysis of Real NVP normalising flow model for satellite anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02015v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellites are used for a multitude of applications, including communications, Earth observation, and space science. Neural networks and deep learning-based approaches now represent the state-of-the-art to enhance the performance and efficiency of these tasks. Given that satellites are susceptible to various faults, one critical application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fault detection. However, despite the advantages of neural networks, these systems are vulnerable to radiation errors, which can significantly impact their reliability. Ensuring the dependability of these solutions requires extensive testing and validation, particularly using fault injection methods. This study analyses a physics-informed (PI) real-valued non-volume preserving (Real NVP) normalizing flow model for fault detection in space systems, with a focus on resilience to Single-Event Upsets (SEUs). We present a customized fault injection framework in TensorFlow to assess neural network resilience. Fault injections are applied through two primary methods: Layer State injection, targeting internal network components such as weights and biases, and Layer Output injection, which modifies layer outputs across various activations. Fault types include zeros, random values, and bit-flip operations, applied at varying levels and across different network layers. Our findings reveal several critical insights, such as the significance of bit-flip errors in critical bits, that can lead to substantial performance degradation or even system failure. With this work, we aim to exhaustively study the resilience of Real NVP models against errors due to radiation, providing a means to guide the implementation of fault tolerance measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Passe...</summary><p>Passed first review at 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)</p></details> | None |
| **[The Multifractal IP Address Structure: Physical Explanation and Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01374v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The structure of IP addresses observed in Internet traffic plays a critical role for a wide range of networking problems of current interest. For example, modern network telemetry systems that take advantage of existing data plane technologies for line rate traffic monitoring and processing cannot afford to waste precious data plane resources on traffic that comes from "uninteresting" regions of the IP address space. However, there is currently no well-established structural model or analysis toolbox that enables a first-principles approach to the specific problem of identifying "uninteresting" regions of the address space or the myriad of other networking problems that prominently feature IP addresses. To address this key missing piece, we present in this paper a first-of-its-kind empirically validated physical explanation for why the observed IP address structure in measured Internet traffic is multifractal in nature. Our root cause analysis overcomes key limitations of mostly forgotten findings from ~20 years ago and demonstrates that the Internet processes and mechanisms responsible for how IP addresses are allocated, assigned, and used in today's Internet are consistent with and well modeled by a class of evocative mathematical models called conservative cascades. We complement this root cause analysis with the development of an improved toolbox that is tailor-made for analyzing finite and discrete sets of IP addresses and includes statistical estimators that engender high confidence in the inferences they produce. We illustrate the use of this toolbox in the context of a novel address structure anomaly detection method we designed and conclude with a discussion of a range of challenging open networking problems that are motivated or inspired by our findings.</p></details> |  | None |
