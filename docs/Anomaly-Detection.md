| **[Anomaly Detection and Early Warning Mechanism for Intelligent Monitoring Systems in Multi-Cloud Environments Based on LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07407v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of multi-cloud environments, it is increasingly important to ensure the security and reliability of intelligent monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection and early warning mechanism for intelligent monitoring system in multi-cloud environment based on Large-Scale Language Model (LLM). On the basis of the existing monitoring framework, the proposed model innovatively introduces a multi-level feature extraction method, which combines the natural language processing ability of LLM with traditional machine learning methods to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection and improve the real-time response efficiency. By introducing the contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, the model dynamically adapts to different cloud service providers and environments, so as to more effectively detect abnormal patterns and predict potential failures. Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than the traditional anomaly detection system in terms of detection accuracy and latency, and significantly improves the resilience and active management ability of cloud infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of 2025 5th International Symposium on Computer Technology and Information Science (ISCTIS 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Enhanced Consistency Bi-directional GAN(CBiGAN) for Malware Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07372v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis, a cornerstone technique in cybersecurity, offers a noninvasive method for detecting malware by analyzing dormant software without executing potentially harmful code. However, traditional static analysis often relies on biased or outdated datasets, leading to gaps in detection capabilities against emerging malware threats. To address this, our study focuses on the binary content of files as key features for malware detection. These binary contents are transformed and represented as images, which then serve as inputs to deep learning models. This method takes into account the visual patterns within the binary data, allowing the model to analyze potential malware effectively. This paper introduces the application of the CBiGAN in the domain of malware anomaly detection. Our approach leverages the CBiGAN for its superior latent space mapping capabilities, critical for modeling complex malware patterns by utilizing a reconstruction error-based anomaly detection method. We utilized several datasets including both portable executable (PE) files as well as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) files. We then evaluated our model against a diverse set of both PE and OLE files, including self-collected malicious executables from 214 malware families. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of this innovative approach, with the CBiGAN achieving high Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with good generalizability, thereby confirming its capability to distinguish between benign and diverse malicious files with reasonably high accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Physics-informed Diffusion for Anomaly Detection in Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06999v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given trajectory data, a domain-specific study area, and a user-defined threshold, we aim to find anomalous trajectories indicative of possible GPS spoofing (e.g., fake trajectory). The problem is societally important to curb illegal activities in international waters, such as unauthorized fishing and illicit oil transfers. The problem is challenging due to advances in AI generated in deep fakes generation (e.g., additive noise, fake trajectories) and lack of adequate amount of labeled samples for ground-truth verification. Recent literature shows promising results for anomalous trajectory detection using generative models despite data sparsity. However, they do not consider fine-scale spatiotemporal dependencies and prior physical knowledge, resulting in higher false-positive rates. To address these limitations, we propose a physics-informed diffusion model that integrates kinematic constraints to identify trajectories that do not adhere to physical laws. Experimental results on real-world datasets in the maritime and urban domains show that the proposed framework results in higher prediction accuracy and lower estimation error rate for anomaly detection and trajectory generation methods, respectively. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/arunshar/Physics-Informed-Diffusion-Probabilistic-Model) |
| **[Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398v6)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, accepted and presented at the 103rd Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting, and published by Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board</p></details> | None |
| **[ARGOS: Anomaly Recognition and Guarding through O-RAN Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06916v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rogue Base Station (RBS) attacks, particularly those exploiting downgrade vulnerabilities, remain a persistent threat as 5G Standalone (SA) deployments are still limited and User Equipment (UE) manufacturers continue to support legacy network connectivity. This work introduces ARGOS, a comprehensive O-RAN compliant Intrusion Detection System (IDS) deployed within the Near Real-Time RIC, designed to detect RBS downgrade attacks in real time, an area previously unexplored within the O-RAN context. The system enhances the 3GPP KPM Service Model to enable richer, UE-level telemetry and features a custom xApp that applies unsupervised Machine Learning models for anomaly detection. Distinctively, the updated KPM Service Model operates on cross-layer features extracted from Modem Layer 1 (ML1) logs and Measurement Reports collected directly from Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) UEs. To evaluate system performance under realistic conditions, a dedicated testbed is implemented using Open5GS, srsRAN, and FlexRIC, and validated against an extensive real-world measurement dataset. Among the evaluated models, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) achieves the best balance of detection performance and efficiency, reaching 99.5% Accuracy with only 0.6% False Positives and minimal system overhead.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Harnessing Vision-Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06836v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases, yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline. Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Cross-Entropy Games for Language Models: From Implicit Knowledge to General Capability Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06832v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary dynamics.</p></details> | 41 pages, 16 figures | None |
| **[LADSG: Label-Anonymized Distillation and Similar Gradient Substitution for Label Privacy in Vertical Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06742v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical federated learning (VFL) has become a key paradigm for collaborative machine learning, enabling multiple parties to train models over distributed feature spaces while preserving data privacy. Despite security protocols that defend against external attacks - such as gradient masking and encryption, which prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data - recent label inference attacks from within the system have emerged. These attacks exploit gradients and semantic embeddings to reconstruct private labels, bypassing traditional defenses. For example, the passive label inference attack can reconstruct tens of thousands of participants' private data using just 40 auxiliary labels, posing a significant security threat. Existing defenses address single leakage pathways, such as gradient leakage or label exposure. As attack strategies evolve, their limitations become clear, especially against hybrid attacks that combine multiple vectors. To address this, we propose Label-Anonymized Defense with Substitution Gradient (LADSG), a unified defense framework that integrates gradient substitution, label anonymization, and anomaly detection. LADSG mitigates both gradient and label leakage while maintaining the scalability and efficiency of VFL. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that LADSG reduces label inference attack success rates by 30-60%, with minimal computational overhead, underscoring the importance of lightweight defenses in securing VFL.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Zero-shot Generalist Graph Anomaly Detection with Unified Neighborhood Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14886v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify nodes in a graph that significantly deviate from normal patterns, plays a crucial role in broad application domains. However, existing GAD methods are one-model-for-one-dataset approaches, i.e., training a separate model for each graph dataset. This largely limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel zero-shot generalist GAD approach UNPrompt that trains a one-for-all detection model, requiring the training of one GAD model on a single graph dataset and then effectively generalizing to detect anomalies in other graph datasets without any retraining or fine-tuning. The key insight in UNPrompt is that i) the predictability of latent node attributes can serve as a generalized anomaly measure and ii) generalized normal and abnormal graph patterns can be learned via latent node attribute prediction in a properly normalized node attribute space. UNPrompt achieves a generalist mode for GAD through two main modules: one module aligns the dimensionality and semantics of node attributes across different graphs via coordinate-wise normalization, while another module learns generalized neighborhood prompts that support the use of latent node attribute predictability as an anomaly score across different datasets. Extensive experiments on real-world GAD datasets show that UNPrompt significantly outperforms diverse competing methods under the generalist GAD setting, and it also has strong superiority under the one-model-for-one-dataset setting.

| **[TrustConnect: An In-Vehicle Anomaly Detection Framework through Topology-Based Trust Rating](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06635v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are equipped with numerous in-vehicle components that interact with the external environment through remote communications and services, such as Bluetooth and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. These components form a network, exchanging information to ensure the proper functioning of the vehicle. However, the presence of false or fabricated information can disrupt the vehicle's performance. Given that these components are interconnected, erroneous data can propagate throughout the network, potentially affecting other components and leading to catastrophic consequences. To address this issue, we propose TrustConnect, a framework designed to assess the trustworthiness of a vehicle's in-vehicle network by evaluating the trust levels of individual components under various network configurations. The proposed framework leverages the interdependency of all the vehicle's components, along with the correlation of their values and their vulnerability to remote injection based on the outside exposure of each component, to determine the reliability of the in-vehicle network. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been validated through programming simulations conducted across various scenarios using a random distribution of an in-vehicle network graph generated with the Networkx package in Python.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in 2025 the IEEE 101st Vehicular Technology Conference: VTC2025-Spring</p></details> | None |
| **[Information-Theoretic Detection of Unusual Source Code Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06508v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The code base of software projects evolves essentially through inserting and removing information to and from the source code. We can measure this evolution via the elements of information - tokens, words, nodes - of the respective representation of the code. In this work, we approach the measurement of the information content of the source code of open-source projects from an information-theoretic standpoint. Our focus is on the entropy of two fundamental representations of code: tokens and abstract syntax tree nodes, from which we derive definitions of textual and structural entropy. We proceed with an empirical assessment where we evaluate the evolution patterns of the entropy of 95 actively maintained open source projects. We calculate the statistical relationships between our derived entropy metrics and classic methods of measuring code complexity and learn that entropy may capture different dimensions of complexity than classic metrics. Finally, we conduct entropy-based anomaly detection of unusual changes to demonstrate that our approach may effectively recognise unusual source code change events with over 60% precision, and lay the groundwork for improvements to information-theoretic measurement of source code evolution, thus paving the way for a new approach to statically gauging program complexity throughout its development.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 17 figures, 7 tables, accepted for publication in the Empirical Software Engineering journal</p></details> | None |
| **[A Lightweight Dual-Branch System for Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection on Consumer Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991v7)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for intelligent security in consumer electronics, such as smart home cameras and personal monitoring systems, is often hindered by the high computational cost and large model sizes of advanced AI. These limitations prevent the effective deployment of real-time Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) on resource-constrained edge devices. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces Rule-based Video Anomaly Detection (RuleVAD), a novel, lightweight system engineered for high-efficiency and low-complexity threat detection directly on consumer hardware. RuleVAD features an innovative decoupled dual-branch architecture to minimize computational load. An implicit branch uses visual features for rapid, coarse-grained binary classification, efficiently filtering out normal activity to avoid unnecessary processing. For potentially anomalous or complex events, a multimodal explicit branch takes over. This branch leverages YOLO-World to detect objects and applies data mining to generate interpretable, text-based association rules from the scene. By aligning these rules with visual data, RuleVAD achieves a more nuanced, fine-grained classification, significantly reducing the false alarms common in vision-only systems. Extensive experiments on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmark datasets show that RuleVAD achieves superior performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed. Crucially, the entire system is optimized for low-power operation and is fully deployable on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board, demonstrating its practical feasibility for bringing advanced, real-time security monitoring to everyday consumer electronic devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE TCE and is under consideration for publication, with potential copyright transfer in the future</p></details> | None |

Then, the paper discusses how the developers adapted contract-based design to MLOps for achieving that goal. As a MLES, Ocean Guard employs code, model, and data contracts to establish guidelines between its services.

| **[Tensor-to-Tensor Models with Fast Iterated Sum Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06041v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums). The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of 97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing and modelling codes are publicly available at https://github.com/diehlj/fast-iterated-sums.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/diehlj/fast-iterated-sums) |
| **[A Reliable Framework for Human-in-the-Loop Anomaly Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03234v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is a critical machine learning task for numerous applications, such as finance, healthcare, and industrial systems. However, even high-performing models may exhibit potential issues such as biases, leading to unreliable outcomes and misplaced confidence. While model explanation techniques, particularly visual explanations, offer valuable insights by elucidating model attributions of their decision, many limitations still exist -- They are primarily instance-based and not scalable across the dataset, and they provide one-directional information from the model to the human side, lacking a mechanism for users to address detected issues. To fulfill these gaps, we introduce HILAD, a novel framework designed to foster a dynamic and bidirectional collaboration between humans and AI for enhancing anomaly detection models in time series. Through our visual interface, HILAD empowers domain experts to detect, interpret, and correct unexpected model behaviors at scale. Our evaluation through user studies with two models and three time series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of HILAD, which fosters a deeper model understanding, immediate corrective actions, and model reliability enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is currently under review</p></details> | None |
| **[An Optimal Cascade Feature-Level Spatiotemporal Fusion Strategy for Anomaly Detection in CAN Bus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18821v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) play a pivotal role in modern infrastructure but face security risks due to the broadcast-based nature of the in-vehicle Controller Area Network (CAN) buses. While numerous machine learning models and strategies have been proposed to detect CAN anomalies, existing approaches lack robustness evaluations and fail to comprehensively detect attacks due to shifting their focus on a subset of dominant structures of anomalies. To overcome these limitations, the current study proposes a cascade feature-level spatiotemporal fusion framework that integrates the spatial features and temporal features through a two-parameter genetic algorithm (2P-GA)-optimized cascade architecture to cover all dominant structures of anomalies. Extensive paired t-test analysis confirms that the model achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.9987, demonstrating robust anomaly detection capabilities. The Spatial Module improves the precision by approximately 4%, while the Temporal Module compensates for recall losses, ensuring high true positive rates. The proposed framework detects all attack types with 100% accuracy on the CAR-HACKING dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. This study provides a validated, robust solution for real-world CAN security challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: u...</summary><p>v3: updated the text and graphs</p></details> | None |
| **[Abnormal component analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16139v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the crossway of machine learning and data analysis, anomaly detection aims at identifying observations that exhibit abnormal behaviour. Be it measurement errors, disease development, severe weather, production quality default(s) (items) or failed equipment, financial frauds or crisis events, their on-time identification and isolation constitute an important task in almost any area of industry and science. While a substantial body of literature is devoted to detection of anomalies, little attention is payed to their explanation. This is the case mostly due to intrinsically non-supervised nature of the task and non-robustness of the exploratory methods like principal component analysis (PCA). We introduce a new statistical tool dedicated for exploratory analysis of abnormal observations using data depth as a score. Abnormal component analysis (shortly ACA) is a method that searches a low-dimensional data representation that best visualises and explains anomalies. This low-dimensional representation not only allows to distinguish groups of anomalies better than the methods of the state of the art, but as well provides a -- linear in variables and thus easily interpretable -- explanation for anomalies. In a comparative simulation and real-data study, ACA also proves advantageous for anomaly analysis with respect to methods present in the literature.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Track Any Anomalous Object: A Granular Video Anomaly Detection Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05175v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial in scenarios such as surveillance and autonomous driving, where timely detection of unexpected activities is essential. Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  | None |

Even more recently, an efficient federated anomaly detection algorithm, FLiForest, based on Isolation Forests has been developed, offering a low-resource, unsupervised method well-suited for edge deployment and continuous learning. In this paper, we present an application of Isolation Forest-based temperature anomaly detection, developed using the previously mentioned federated learning frameworks, aimed at small edge devices and IoT systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated, achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations, while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and collaborative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 algorithms, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Monotonic anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23158v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised anomaly detection is based on the principle that potential anomalies are those records that look different from normal training data. However, in some cases we are specifically interested in anomalies that correspond to high attribute values (or low, but not both). We present two asymmetrical distance measures that take this monotonicity into account: ramp distance and signed distance. Through experiments on synthetic and real-life datasets, we show that ramp distance increases anomaly detection performance over the traditional absolute distance. While signed distance also performs well on synthetic data, it performs substantially poorer on real-life datasets. We argue that this is a consequence of the fact that when using signed distance, low values of certain attributes automatically compensate for high values of other attributes, such that anomaly detection is reduced to counting the total attribute value sum, which is too simplistic in practice.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[KPIRoot+: An Efficient Integrated Framework for Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Large-Scale Cloud Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04569v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure the reliability of cloud systems, their performance is monitored using KPIs (key performance indicators). When issues arise, root cause localization identifies KPIs responsible for service degradation, aiding in quick diagnosis and resolution. Traditional methods rely on similarity calculations, which can be ineffective in complex, interdependent cloud environments. While deep learning-based approaches model these dependencies better, they often face challenges such as high computational demands and lack of interpretability. To address these issues, KPIRoot is proposed as an efficient method combining similarity and causality analysis. It uses symbolic aggregate approximation for compact KPI representation, improving analysis efficiency. However, deployment in Cloud H revealed two drawbacks: 1) threshold-based anomaly detection misses some performance anomalies, and 2) SAX representation fails to capture intricate variation trends. KPIRoot+ addresses these limitations, outperforming eight state-of-the-art baselines by 2.9% to 35.7%, while reducing time cost by 34.7%. We also share our experience deploying KPIRoot in a large-scale cloud provider's production environment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A VLM-based Method for Visual Anomaly Detection in Robotic Scientific Laboratories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05405v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robot scientific laboratories, visual anomaly detection is important for the timely identification and resolution of potential faults or deviations. It has become a key factor in ensuring the stability and safety of experimental processes. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a VLM-based visual reasoning approach that supports different levels of supervision through four progressively informative prompt configurations. To systematically evaluate its effectiveness, we construct a visual benchmark tailored for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Experiments on two representative vision-language models show that detection accuracy improves as more contextual information is provided, confirming the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed reasoning approach for process anomaly detection in scientific workflows. Furthermore, real-world validations at selected experimental steps confirm that first-person visual observation can effectively identify process-level anomalies. This work provides both a data-driven foundation and an evaluation framework for vision anomaly detection in scientific experiment workflows.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An AI-Based Public Health Data Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04429v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CurvGAD: Leveraging Curvature for Enhanced Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08605v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does the intrinsic curvature of complex networks hold the key to unveiling graph anomalies that conventional approaches overlook? Reconstruction-based graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods overlook such geometric outliers, focusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies. To this end, we propose CurvGAD - a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder that introduces the notion of curvature-based geometric anomalies. CurvGAD introduces two parallel pipelines for enhanced anomaly interpretability: (1) Curvature-equivariant geometry reconstruction, which focuses exclusively on reconstructing the edge curvatures using a mixed-curvature, Riemannian encoder and Gaussian kernel-based decoder; and (2) Curvature-invariant structure and attribute reconstruction, which decouples structural and attribute anomalies from geometric irregularities by regularizing graph curvature under discrete Ollivier-Ricci flow, thereby isolating the non-geometric anomalies.

However, anomalies in graph-structured data present unique challenges, including label scarcity, ill-defined anomalies, and varying anomaly types, making supervised or semi-supervised methods unreliable. Researchers often adopt unsupervised approaches to address these challenges, assuming that anomalies deviate significantly from the normal data distribution. Yet, when the available data is insufficient, capturing the normal distribution accurately and comprehensively becomes difficult. To overcome this limitation, we propose to utilize external graph data (i.e., graph data in the wild) to help anomaly detection tasks. This naturally raises the question: How can we use external data to help graph anomaly detection tasks? To answer this question, we propose a framework called Wild-GAD. It is built upon a unified database, UniWildGraph, which comprises a large and diverse collection of graph data with broad domain coverage, ample data volume, and a unified feature space. Further, we develop selection criteria based on representativity and diversity to identify the most suitable external data for anomaly detection task. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Wild-GAD. Compared to the baseline methods, our framework has an average 18% AUCROC and 32% AUCPR improvement over the best-competing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD2025</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies, respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality. Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD capabilities.

| **[Lower Ricci Curvature for Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03943v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks with higher-order interactions, prevalent in biological, social, and information systems, are naturally represented as hypergraphs, yet their structural complexity poses fundamental challenges for geometric characterization. While curvature-based methods offer powerful insights in graph analysis, existing extensions to hypergraphs suffer from critical trade-offs: combinatorial approaches such as Forman-Ricci curvature capture only coarse features, whereas geometric methods like Ollivier-Ricci curvature offer richer expressivity but demand costly optimal transport computations. To address these challenges, we introduce hypergraph lower Ricci curvature (HLRC), a novel curvature metric defined in closed form that achieves a principled balance between interpretability and efficiency. Evaluated across diverse synthetic and real-world hypergraph datasets, HLRC consistently reveals meaningful higher-order organization, distinguishing intra- from inter-community hyperedges, uncovering latent semantic labels, tracking temporal dynamics, and supporting robust clustering of hypergraphs based on global structure. By unifying geometric sensitivity with algorithmic simplicity, HLRC provides a versatile foundation for hypergraph analytics, with broad implications for tasks including node classification, anomaly detection, and generative modeling in complex systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[INP-Former++: Advancing Universal Anomaly Detection via Intrinsic Normal Prototypes and Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03660v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection and medical diagnosis, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class, and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability. Furthermore, we propose a soft version of the INP Coherence Loss and enhance INP-Former by incorporating residual learning, leading to the development of INP-Former++. The proposed method significantly improves detection performance across single-class, multi-class, semi-supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Anomaly Detection in Complex Dynamical Systems: A Systematic Framework Using Embedding Theory and Physics-Inspired Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19307v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems is essential for ensuring reliability, safety, and efficiency in industrial and cyber-physical infrastructures. Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan aeroengine degradation. TDC-AE outperforms LSTMs and Transformers while achieving a nearly 200x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this approach has been rarely explored in multi-modality anomaly detection, particularly involving 3D and RGB images. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-modality augmentation method for 3D anomaly synthesis, which is simple and capable of mimicking the characteristics of 3D defects. Incorporating with our anomaly synthesis method, we introduce a reconstruction-based discriminative anomaly detection network, in which a dual-modal discriminator is employed to fuse the original and reconstructed embedding of two modalities for anomaly detection. Additionally, we design an augmentation dropout mechanism to enhance the generalizability of the discriminator. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on detection precision and achieves competitive segmentation performance on both MVTec 3D-AD and Eyescandies datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/SunnierLee/DAS3D</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/SunnierLee/DAS3D) |

Since tabular data contains complex interdependencies among features, it presents a unique challenge for adversarial samples which must maintain coherence and respect these interdependencies to remain indistinguishable from benign data. Moreover, existing attack evaluation metrics-such as the success rate, perturbation magnitude, and query count-fail to account for this challenge. To address those gaps, we propose a technique for perturbing dependent features while preserving sample coherence. In addition, we introduce Class-Specific Anomaly Detection (CSAD), an effective novel anomaly detection approach, along with concrete metrics for assessing the quality of tabular adversarial attacks. CSAD evaluates adversarial samples relative to their predicted class distribution, rather than a broad benign distribution. It ensures that subtle adversarial perturbations, which may appear coherent in other classes, are correctly identified as anomalies. We integrate SHAP explainability techniques to detect inconsistencies in model decision-making, extending CSAD for SHAP-based anomaly detection. Our evaluation incorporates both anomaly detection rates with SHAP-based assessments to provide a more comprehensive measure of adversarial sample quality. We evaluate various attack strategies, examining black-box query-based and transferability-based gradient attacks across four target models. Experiments on benchmark tabular datasets reveal key differences in the attacker's risk and effort and attack quality, offering insights into the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs faced by attackers and defenders. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on adversarial attacks and defense development in the tabular domain.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10080v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). By leveraging auxiliary data during training, these models can directly perform cross-category anomaly detection on target datasets, such as detecting defects on industrial product surfaces or identifying tumors in organ tissues. Existing approaches typically construct text prompts through either manual design or the optimization of learnable prompt vectors. However, these methods face several challenges: 1) handcrafted prompts require extensive expert knowledge and trial-and-error; 2) single-form learnable prompts struggle to capture complex anomaly semantics; and 3) an unconstrained prompt space limits generalization to unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning (Bayes-PFL), which models the prompt space as a learnable probability distribution from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, a prompt flow module is designed to learn both image-specific and image-agnostic distributions, which are jointly utilized to regularize the text prompt space and improve the model's generalization on unseen categories. These learned distributions are then sampled to generate diverse text prompts, effectively covering the prompt space. Additionally, a residual cross-model attention (RCA) module is introduced to better align dynamic text embeddings with fine-grained image features. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical datasets demonstrate our method's superior performance.

| **[Investigating Mask-aware Prototype Learning for Tabular Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02757v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular anomaly detection, which aims at identifying deviant samples, has been crucial in a variety of real-world applications, such as medical disease identification, financial fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, etc. Although recent deep learning-based methods have achieved competitive performances, these methods suffer from representation entanglement and the lack of global correlation modeling, which hinders anomaly detection performance. To tackle the problem, we incorporate mask modeling and prototype learning into tabular anomaly detection. The core idea is to design learnable masks by disentangled representation learning within a projection space and extracting normal dependencies as explicit global prototypes. Specifically, the overall model involves two parts: (i) During encoding, we perform mask modeling in both the data space and projection space with orthogonal basis vectors for learning shared disentangled normal patterns; (ii) During decoding, we decode multiple masked representations in parallel for reconstruction and learn association prototypes to extract normal characteristic correlations. Our proposal derives from a distribution-matching perspective, where both projection space learning and association prototype learning are formulated as optimal transport problems, and the calibration distances are utilized to refine the anomaly scores. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 20 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[MemoryOut: Learning Principal Features via Multimodal Sparse Filtering Network for Semi-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02535v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods based on reconstruction or prediction face two critical challenges: (1) strong generalization capability often results in accurate reconstruction or prediction of abnormal events, making it difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns; (2) reliance only on low-level appearance and motion cues limits their ability to identify high-level semantic in abnormal events from complex scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework with two key innovations. First, to suppress excessive generalization, we introduce the Sparse Feature Filtering Module (SFFM) that employs bottleneck filters to dynamically and adaptively remove abnormal information from features. Unlike traditional memory modules, it does not need to memorize the normal prototypes across the training dataset. Further, we design the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for SFFM. Each expert is responsible for extracting specialized principal features during running time, and different experts are selectively activated to ensure the diversity of the learned principal features. Second, to overcome the neglect of semantics in existing methods, we integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate textual descriptions for video clips, enabling comprehensive joint modeling of semantic, appearance, and motion cues. Additionally, we enforce modality consistency through semantic similarity constraints and motion frame-difference contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets validate the effectiveness of our multimodal joint modeling framework and sparse feature filtering paradigm.

While invariant-based anomaly detection is effective, existing methods are limited: data-driven approaches lack semantic context, and physics-based models require extensive manual work. We propose INVARLLM, a hybrid framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract semantic information from CPS documentation and generate physical invariants, then validates these against real system data using a PCMCI+-inspired K-means method. This approach combines LLM semantic understanding with empirical validation to ensure both interpretability and reliability. We evaluate INVARLLM on SWaT and WADI datasets, achieving 100% precision in anomaly detection with no false alarms, outperforming all existing methods. Our results demonstrate that integrating LLM-derived semantics with statistical validation provides a scalable and dependable solution for CPS security.</p></details> |  | None |

In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models, trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs, enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image, tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it particularly suitable for edge computing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

The sequential nature of data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors, actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time requirements of industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages;16 figures;Submitted to Elsevier (Information Fusion)</p></details> | None |

One promising key area approach focuses on using system calls and API Calls, the core communication between user applications and the operating system and their kernels. These calls provide valuable insight into how software or programs behaves, making them an useful tool for spotting suspicious or harmful activity of programs and software. This chapter takes a deep down look at how system calls are used in malware detection and classification, covering techniques like static and dynamic analysis, as well as sandboxing. By combining these methods with advanced techniques like machine learning, statistical analysis, and anomaly detection, researchers can analyze system call patterns to tell the difference between normal and malicious behavior.

In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are trained on vast unlabelled code corpora, yet perform only marginally better than coin flips when directly prompted to detect vulnerabilities. In this paper, we reframe vulnerability detection as anomaly detection, based on the premise that vulnerable code is rare and thus anomalous relative to patterns learned by LLMs. We introduce ANVIL, which performs a masked code reconstruction task: the LLM reconstructs a masked line of code, and deviations from the original are scored as anomalies. We propose a hybrid anomaly score that combines exact match, cross-entropy loss, prediction confidence, and structural complexity. We evaluate our approach across multiple LLM families, scoring methods, and context sizes, and against vulnerabilities after the LLM's training cut-off. On the PrimeVul dataset, ANVIL outperforms state-of-the-art supervised detectors-LineVul, LineVD, and LLMAO-achieving up to 2x higher Top-3 accuracy, 75% better Normalized MFR, and a significant improvement on ROC-AUC. Finally, by integrating ANVIL with fuzzers, we uncover two previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating the practical utility of anomaly-guided detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnomalyGFM: Graph Foundation Model for Zero/Few-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09254v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority of the nodes in a graph, which has been attracting significant attention in recent years. Existing generalist graph models have achieved remarkable success in different graph tasks but struggle to generalize to the GAD task. This limitation arises from their difficulty in learning generalized knowledge for capturing the inherently infrequent, irregular and heterogeneous abnormality patterns in graphs from different domains. To address this challenge, we propose AnomalyGFM, a GAD-oriented graph foundation model that supports zero-shot inference and few-shot prompt tuning for GAD in diverse graph datasets. One key insight is that graph-agnostic representations for normal and abnormal classes are required to support effective zero/few-shot GAD across different graphs. Motivated by this, AnomalyGFM is pre-trained to align data-independent, learnable normal and abnormal class prototypes with node representation residuals (i.e., representation deviation of a node from its neighbors). The residual features essentially project the node information into a unified feature space where we can effectively measure the abnormality of nodes from different graphs in a consistent way. This provides a driving force for the learning of graph-agnostic, discriminative prototypes for the normal and abnormal classes, which can be used to enable zero-shot GAD on new graphs, including very large-scale graphs. If there are few-shot labeled normal nodes available in the new graphs, AnomalyGFM can further support prompt tuning to leverage these nodes for better adaptation. Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used GAD datasets with real anomalies, demonstrate that AnomalyGFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods under both zero- and few-shot GAD settings.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD2025 | None |

Graph autoencoders (GAEs) have emerged as a dominant approach by reconstructing graph structures and node features while deriving anomaly scores from reconstruction errors. However, relying solely on reconstruction error for anomaly detection has limitations, as it increases the sensitivity to noise and overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Graph Evidential Learning (GEL), a probabilistic framework that redefines the reconstruction process through evidential learning. By modeling node features and graph topology using evidential distributions, GEL quantifies two types of uncertainty: graph uncertainty and reconstruction uncertainty, incorporating them into the anomaly scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEL achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high robustness against noise and structural perturbations.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD25 | None |

To address these limitations, we present a novel weakly supervised framework that leverages audio-visual collaboration for robust video anomaly detection. Capitalizing on the exceptional cross-modal representation learning capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) across visual, audio, and textual domains, our framework introduces two major innovations: an efficient audio-visual fusion that enables adaptive cross-modal integration through lightweight parametric adaptation while maintaining the frozen CLIP backbone, and a novel audio-visual prompt that dynamically enhances text embeddings with key multimodal information based on the semantic correlation between audio-visual features and textual labels, significantly improving CLIP's generalization for the video anomaly detection task. Moreover, to enhance robustness against modality deficiency during inference, we further develop an uncertainty-driven feature distillation module that synthesizes audio-visual representations from visual-only inputs. This module employs uncertainty modeling based on the diversity of audio-visual features to dynamically emphasize challenging features during the distillation process. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks, with audio integration significantly boosting anomaly detection accuracy in various scenarios. Notably, with unimodal data enhanced by uncertainty-driven distillation, our approach consistently outperforms current unimodal VAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables.

Existing methods for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed. In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR) module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data. Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the problem of sample imbalance effectively.

However, traditional methods, such as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), struggle with scalability owing to their quadratic computational complexity. To address this limitation, we introduce WOA-kMedoids, a novel unsupervised clustering method that incorporates the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a nature-inspired metaheuristic inspired by the hunting strategies of humpback whales. By optimizing the centroid selection, WOA-kMedoids reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to near-linear with respect to the number of observations, enabling scalability to large datasets while maintaining high clustering accuracy. We evaluated WOA-kMedoids using 25 diverse time-series datasets from the UCR archive. Our empirical results show that WOA-kMedoids achieved a clustering performance comparable to PAM, with an average Rand Index (RI) of 0.731 compared to PAM's 0.739, outperforming PAM on 12 out of 25 datasets. While exhibiting a slightly higher runtime than PAM on small datasets (<300 observations), WOA-kMedoids outperformed PAM on larger datasets, with an average speedup of 1.7x and a maximum of 2.3x. The scalability of WOA-kMedoids, combined with its high accuracy, makes them a promising choice for unsupervised clustering in big data applications. This method has implications for efficient knowledge discovery in massive unlabeled datasets, particularly where traditional k-medoids methods are computationally infeasible, including IoT anomaly detection, biomedical signal analysis, and customer behavior clustering.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Cluster-Aware Causal Mixer for Online Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00188v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early and accurate detection of anomalies in time series data is critical, given the significant risks associated with false or missed detections. While MLP-based mixer models have shown promise in time series analysis, they lack a causality mechanism to preserve temporal dependencies inherent in the system. Moreover, real-world multivariate time series often contain numerous channels with diverse inter-channel correlations. A single embedding mechanism for all channels does not effectively capture these complex relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cluster-aware causal mixer to effectively detect anomalies in multivariate time series. Our model groups channels into clusters based on their correlations, with each cluster processed through a dedicated embedding layer. In addition, we introduce a causal mixer in our model, which mixes the information while maintaining causality. Furthermore, we present an anomaly detection framework that accumulates the anomaly evidence over time to prevent false positives due to nominal outliers. Our proposed model operates in an online fashion, making it suitable for real-time time-series anomaly detection tasks. Experimental evaluations across six public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves superior F1 scores.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generator Based Inference (GBI)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00119v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical inference in physics is often based on samples from a generator (sometimes referred to as a ``forward model") that emulate experimental data and depend on parameters of the underlying theory. Modern machine learning has supercharged this workflow to enable high-dimensional and unbinned analyses to utilize much more information than ever before. We propose a general framework for describing the integration of machine learning with generators called Generator Based Inference (GBI). A well-studied special case of this setup is Simulation Based Inference (SBI) where the generator is a physics-based simulator. In this work, we examine other methods within the GBI toolkit that use data-driven methods to build the generator. In particular, we focus on resonant anomaly detection, where the generator describing the background is learned from sidebands. We show how to perform machine learning-based parameter estimation in this context with data-derived generators. This transforms the statistical outputs of anomaly detection to be directly interpretable and the performance on the LHCO community benchmark dataset establishes a new state-of-the-art for anomaly detection sensitivity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures | None |

Previous investigations in medical images have often been constrained to specific anatomical regions, particular applications, and limited datasets, resulting in isolated diffusion models. This paper introduces a diffusion-based foundation model to address a diverse range of medical image tasks, namely MedDiff-FM. MedDiff-FM leverages 3D CT images from multiple publicly available datasets, covering anatomical regions from head to abdomen, to pre-train a diffusion foundation model, and explores the capabilities of the diffusion foundation model across a variety of application scenarios. The diffusion foundation model handles multi-level integrated image processing both at the image-level and patch-level, utilizes position embedding to establish multi-level spatial relationships, and leverages region classes and anatomical structures to capture certain anatomical regions. MedDiff-FM manages several downstream tasks seamlessly, including image denoising, anomaly detection, and image synthesis. MedDiff-FM is also capable of performing super-resolution, lesion generation, and lesion inpainting by rapidly fine-tuning the diffusion foundation model using ControlNet with task-specific conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MedDiff-FM in addressing diverse downstream medical image tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

While traditional graph anomaly detection techniques have been extensively studied, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order interactions that are crucial for identifying complex structural anomalies. These higher-order interactions can arise either directly from the underlying data itself or through graph lifting techniques. Our approach leverages the spectral properties of Hodge Laplacians of simplicial complexes to effectively model multi-way interactions among data points. By incorporating higher-dimensional simplicial structures into our method, our method enhances both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing graph methods in detecting both events and change points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for KDD 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing patch-based methods often suffer from geometric fidelity issues due to discrete voxelization or projection-based representations, limiting fine-grained anomaly localization. We introduce Pose-Aware Signed Distance Field (PASDF), a novel framework that integrates 3D anomaly detection and repair by learning a continuous, pose-invariant shape representation. PASDF leverages a Pose Alignment Module for canonicalization and a SDF Network to dynamically incorporate pose, enabling implicit learning of high-fidelity anomaly repair templates from the continuous SDF. This facilitates precise pixel-level anomaly localization through an Anomaly-Aware Scoring Module. Crucially, the continuous 3D representation in PASDF extends beyond detection, facilitating in-situ anomaly repair. Experiments on Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving high object-level AUROC scores of 80.2% and 90.0%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of continuous geometric representations in advancing 3D anomaly detection and facilitating practical anomaly region repair.

We propose a novel algorithm that iteratively reduces the intra-cluster variance of N clusters until a global minimum is reached, yielding tighter clusters than the standard k-means algorithm. We evaluate the method using intrinsic measures for unsupervised learning, including the silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index, and extend it to anomaly detection by identifying points whose assignment causes a significant variance increase. External validation on synthetic data and the UCI Breast Cancer and UCI Wine Quality datasets employs the Jaccard similarity score, V-measure, and F1 score. Results show variance reductions of 18.7% and 88.1% on the synthetic and Wine Quality datasets, respectively, along with accuracy and F1 score improvements of 22.5% and 20.8% on the Wine Quality dataset.</p></details> | IEEE ICCCSP | None |

However, while many existing models show promising performance, they are often too large, computationally demanding, and impractical to deploy on resource-constrained embedded devices that can be easily installed on the production lines of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). To bridge this gap, we present KairosAD, a novel supervised approach that uses the power of the Mobile Segment Anything Model (MobileSAM) for image-based anomaly detection. KairosAD has been evaluated on the two well-known industrial anomaly detection datasets, i.e., MVTec-AD and ViSA. The results show that KairosAD requires 78% fewer parameters and boasts a 4x faster inference time compared to the leading state-of-the-art model, while maintaining comparable AUROC performance. We deployed KairosAD on two embedded devices, the NVIDIA Jetson NX, and the NVIDIA Jetson AGX. Finally, KairosAD was successfully installed and tested on the real production line of the Industrial Computer Engineering Laboratory (ICE Lab) at the University of Verona.

| **[SentinelAgent: Graph-based Anomaly Detection in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24201v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) introduces new security and reliability challenges. While these systems show great promise in decomposing and coordinating complex tasks, they also face multi-faceted risks across prompt manipulation, unsafe tool usage, and emergent agent miscoordination. Existing guardrail mechanisms offer only partial protection, primarily at the input-output level, and fall short in addressing systemic or multi-point failures in MAS. In this work, we present a system-level anomaly detection framework tailored for MAS, integrating structural modeling with runtime behavioral oversight. Our approach consists of two components. First, we propose a graph-based framework that models agent interactions as dynamic execution graphs, enabling semantic anomaly detection at node, edge, and path levels. Second, we introduce a pluggable SentinelAgent, an LLM-powered oversight agent that observes, analyzes, and intervenes in MAS execution based on security policies and contextual reasoning. By bridging abstract detection logic with actionable enforcement, our method detects not only single-point faults and prompt injections but also multi-agent collusion and latent exploit paths. We validate our framework through two case studies, including an email assistant and Microsoft's Magentic-One system, demonstrating its ability to detect covert risks and provide explainable root-cause attribution. Our work lays the foundation for more trustworthy, monitorable, and secure agent-based AI ecosystems.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP, demonstrating exceptional efficiency alongside state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Distributed Federated Learning for Vehicular Network Security: Anomaly Detection Benefits and Multi-Domain Attack Threats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23706v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale, high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data. Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network. We further show that local training data size and time-varying network connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An AI System for Continuous Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Grading Using Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection with Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11500v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diagnostic accuracy and subjectivity of existing Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) ordinal grading systems has been a subject of on-going debate and concern. Existing automated solutions are trained to emulate these imperfect systems, whilst also being reliant on large annotated databases for fully-supervised training. This work proposes a three stage approach for automated continuous grading of knee OA that is built upon the principles of Anomaly Detection (AD); learning a robust representation of healthy knee X-rays and grading disease severity based on its distance to the centre of normality. In the first stage, SS-FewSOME is proposed, a self-supervised AD technique that learns the 'normal' representation, requiring only examples of healthy subjects and <3% of the labels that existing methods require. In the second stage, this model is used to pseudo label a subset of unlabelled data as 'normal' or 'anomalous', followed by denoising of pseudo labels with CLIP. The final stage involves retraining on labelled and pseudo labelled data using the proposed Dual Centre Representation Learning (DCRL) which learns the centres of two representation spaces; normal and anomalous. Disease severity is then graded based on the distance to the learned centres. The proposed methodology outperforms existing techniques by margins of up to 24% in terms of OA detection and the disease severity scores correlate with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system at the same level as human expert performance.

Despite advances in anomaly detection, existing methods often lack interpretability and struggle to capture the causal and contextual aspects of abnormal events. This limitation is further compounded by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating reasoning ability in anomaly scenarios. To address both challenges, we introduce VAU-R1, a data-efficient framework built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which enhances anomaly reasoning through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Besides, we propose VAU-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark tailored for video anomaly reasoning, featuring multiple-choice QA, detailed rationales, temporal annotations, and descriptive captions. Empirical results show that VAU-R1 significantly improves question answering accuracy, temporal grounding, and reasoning coherence across diverse contexts. Together, our method and benchmark establish a strong foundation for interpretable and reasoning-aware video anomaly understanding.

| **[Sentinel: Scheduling Live Streams with Proactive Anomaly Detection in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23347v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by 74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.14619</p></details> | None |

However, the design of an optimal augmentation strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components. Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios across diverse datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 | None |

We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

However, existing ZSAD research has shown limitations by either not considering domain adaptation of general-purpose backbone models to anomaly detection domains or by implementing only partial adaptation to some model components. In this paper, we propose HeadCLIP to overcome these limitations by effectively adapting both text and image encoders to the domain. HeadCLIP generalizes the concepts of normality and abnormality through learnable prompts in the text encoder, and introduces learnable head weights to the image encoder to dynamically adjust the features held by each attention head according to domain characteristics. Additionally, we maximize the effect of domain adaptation by introducing a joint anomaly score that utilizes domain-adapted pixel-level information for image-level anomaly detection. Experimental results using multiple real datasets in both industrial and medical domains show that HeadCLIP outperforms existing ZSAD techniques at both pixel and image levels. In the industrial domain, improvements of up to 4.9%p in pixel-level mean anomaly detection score (mAD) and up to 3.0%p in image-level mAD were achieved, with similar improvements (3.2%p, 3.1%p) in the medical domain.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this gap, we introduce OmniAD, a novel framework that unifies anomaly detection and understanding for fine-grained analysis. OmniAD is a multimodal reasoner that combines visual and textual reasoning processes. The visual reasoning provides detailed inspection by leveraging Text-as-Mask Encoding to perform anomaly detection through text generation without manually selected thresholds. Following this, Visual Guided Textual Reasoning conducts comprehensive analysis by integrating visual perception. To enhance few-shot generalization, we employ an integrated training strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (GRPO), incorporating three sophisticated reward functions. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAD achieves a performance of 79.1 on the MMAD benchmark, surpassing models such as Qwen2.5-VL-7B and GPT-4o. It also shows strong results across multiple anomaly detection benchmarks. These results highlight the importance of enhancing visual perception for effective reasoning in anomaly understanding.

Existing datasets and methods, mainly designed for fixed ground-level views, struggle to adapt to these conditions, leading to significant performance drops in drone-view scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce A2Seek (Aerial Anomaly Seek), a large-scale, reasoning-centric benchmark dataset for aerial anomaly understanding. This dataset covers various scenarios and environmental conditions, providing high-resolution real-world aerial videos with detailed annotations, including anomaly categories, frame-level timestamps, region-level bounding boxes, and natural language explanations for causal reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose A2Seek-R1, a novel reasoning framework that generalizes R1-style strategies to aerial anomaly understanding, enabling a deeper understanding of "Where" anomalies occur and "Why" they happen in aerial frames. To this end, A2Seek-R1 first employs a graph-of-thought (GoT)-guided supervised fine-tuning approach to activate the model's latent reasoning capabilities on A2Seek. Then, we introduce Aerial Group Relative Policy Optimization (A-GRPO) to design rule-based reward functions tailored to aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a novel "seeking" mechanism that simulates UAV flight behavior by directing the model's attention to informative regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2Seek-R1 achieves up to a 22.04% improvement in AP for prediction accuracy and a 13.9% gain in mIoU for anomaly localization, exhibiting strong generalization across complex environments and out-of-distribution scenarios.

When manifested as network threats to be mitigated, service outages to be prevented, and security risks to be ameliorated, detecting such anomalous network behaviors becomes of great importance. However, the growing scale and complexity of the mobile communication networks, as well as the ever-increasing amount and dimensionality of the network surveillance data, make it extremely difficult to monitor a mobile network and discover abnormal network behaviors. Recent advances in machine learning allow for obtaining near-optimal solutions to complicated decision-making problems with many sources of uncertainty that cannot be accurately characterized by traditional mathematical models. However, most machine learning algorithms are centralized, which renders them inapplicable to a large-scale distributed wireless networks with tens of millions of mobile devices. In this article, we present fog intelligence, a distributed machine learning architecture that enables intelligent wireless network management. It preserves the advantage of both edge processing and centralized cloud computing. In addition, the proposed architecture is scalable, privacy-preserving, and well suited for intelligent management of a distributed wireless network.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IEEE Network</p></details> | None |

The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and complexity. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review | None |

Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion models, as a class of emerging generative approaches, have demonstrated promising capabilities in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing tasks. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model are capable of modeling high-dimensional spectral structures, generate high-quality samples, and achieve competitive performance in spectral-spatial denoising tasks and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Is Hyperbolic Space All You Need for Medical Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21228v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical anomaly detection has emerged as a promising solution to challenges in data availability and labeling constraints. Traditional methods extract features from different layers of pre-trained networks in Euclidean space; however, Euclidean representations fail to effectively capture the hierarchical relationships within these features, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection performance. We propose a novel yet simple approach that projects feature representations into hyperbolic space, aggregates them based on confidence levels, and classifies samples as healthy or anomalous. Our experiments demonstrate that hyperbolic space consistently outperforms Euclidean-based frameworks, achieving higher AUROC scores at both image and pixel levels across multiple medical benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that hyperbolic space exhibits resilience to parameter variations and excels in few-shot scenarios, where healthy images are scarce. These findings underscore the potential of hyperbolic space as a powerful alternative for medical anomaly detection.

Current methods exhibit severe performance degradation on the MVTec AD 2 benchmark due to its complex real-world challenges. To solve this problem, we propose a robust framework RoBiS, which consists of three core modules: (1) Swin-Cropping, a high-resolution image pre-processing strategy to preserve the information of small anomalies through overlapping window cropping. (2) The data augmentation of noise addition and lighting simulation is carried out on the training data to improve the robustness of AD model. We use INP-Former as our baseline, which could generate better results on the various sub-images. (3) The traditional statistical-based binarization strategy (mean+3std) is combined with our previous work, MEBin (published in CVPR2025), for joint adaptive binarization. Then, SAM is further employed to refine the segmentation results. Compared with some methods reported by the MVTec AD 2, our RoBiS achieves a 29.2% SegF1 improvement (from 21.8% to 51.00%) on Test_private and 29.82% SegF1 gains (from 16.7% to 46.52%) on Test_private_mixed.

| **[Robust and Explainable Detector of Time Series Anomaly via Augmenting Multiclass Pseudo-Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20765v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series has been a pivotal research area for decades. Current mainstream approaches focus on learning normality, on the assumption that all or most of the samples in the training set are normal. However, anomalies in the training set (i.e., anomaly contamination) can be misleading. Recent studies employ data augmentation to generate pseudo-anomalies and learn the boundary separating the training samples from the augmented samples. Although this approach mitigates anomaly contamination if augmented samples mimic unseen real anomalies, it suffers from several limitations. (1) Covering a wide range of time series anomalies is challenging. (2) It disregards augmented samples that resemble normal samples (i.e., false anomalies). (3) It places too much trust in the labels of training and augmented samples. In response, we propose RedLamp, which employs diverse data augmentations to generate multiclass pseudo-anomalies and learns the multiclass boundary. Such multiclass pseudo-anomalies cover a wide variety of time series anomalies. We conduct multiclass classification using soft labels, which prevents the model from being overconfident and ensures its robustness against contaminated/false anomalies. The learned latent space is inherently explainable as it is trained to separate pseudo-anomalies into multiclasses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RedLamp in anomaly detection and its robustness against anomaly contamination.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 | None |

By integrating core tenets, such as continuous verification, least privilege access (LPA), data confidentiality, and behavioral analytics into the design, training, and deployment of FMs, ZTFMs can enable secure, privacy-preserving AI across distributed, heterogeneous, and potentially adversarial IoT environments. We present the first structured synthesis of ZTFMs, identifying their potential to transform conventional trust-based IoT architectures into resilient, self-defending ecosystems. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive technical framework, incorporating federated learning (FL), blockchain-based identity management, micro-segmentation, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to support decentralized, verifiable intelligence at the network edge. In addition, we investigate emerging security threats unique to ZTFM-enabled systems and evaluate countermeasures, such as anomaly detection, adversarial training, and secure aggregation. Through this analysis, we highlight key open research challenges in terms of scalability, secure orchestration, interpretable threat attribution, and dynamic trust calibration. This survey lays a foundational roadmap for secure, intelligent, and trustworthy IoT infrastructures powered by FMs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  | None |

These can be casewise outliers, such as cases belonging to a different population, or cellwise outliers, which are deviating cells (entries) of the data matrix. Recently some robust covariance estimators have been developed that can handle both types of outliers, but their computation is only feasible up to at most 20 dimensions. To remedy this we propose the cellRCov method, a robust covariance estimator that simultaneously handles casewise outliers, cellwise outliers, and missing data. It relies on a decomposition of the covariance on principal and orthogonal subspaces, leveraging recent work on robust PCA. It also employs a ridge-type regularization to stabilize the estimated covariance matrix. We establish some theoretical properties of cellRCov, including its casewise and cellwise influence functions as well as consistency and asymptotic normality. A simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of cellRCov in contaminated and missing data scenarios. Furthermore, its practical utility is illustrated in a real-world application to anomaly detection. We also construct and illustrate the cellRCCA method for robust and regularized canonical correlation analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing MLLM-based Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) methods remain limited to shallow anomaly descriptions without deep reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new task named Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which aims to enable deep analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video by requiring MLLMs to think explicitly before answering. To this end, we propose Vad-R1, an end-to-end MLLM-based framework for VAR. Specifically, we design a Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought (P2C-CoT) that simulates the human process of recognizing anomalies, guiding the MLLM to reason anomaly step-by-step. Based on the structured P2C-CoT, we construct Vad-Reasoning, a dedicated dataset for VAR. Furthermore, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which explicitly incentivizes the anomaly reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self-verification mechanism with limited annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that Vad-R1 achieves superior performance, outperforming both open-source and proprietary models on VAD and VAR tasks.

In real-world industrial anomaly detection, it is crucial to accurately identify anomalies with physical complexity, such as transparent or reflective surfaces, occlusions, and low-contrast contaminations. The recently proposed MVTec AD 2 dataset significantly narrows the gap between publicly available benchmarks and anomalies found in real-world industrial environments. To address the challenges posed by this dataset--such as complex and varying lighting conditions and real anomalies with large scale differences--we propose a fully training-free anomaly detection and segmentation method based on feature extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then segmented by performing nearest neighbor matching between test image features and the memory bank. Our method achieves competitive results on both test sets of the MVTec AD 2 dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

However, since LLMs are not designed for time series tasks, simpler models like linear regressions can often achieve comparable performance with far less complexity. In this study, we perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of applying LLMs to key time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection. We compare the performance of LLMs against simpler baseline models, such as single layer linear models and randomly initialized LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs offer minimal advantages for these core time series tasks and may even distort the temporal structure of the data. In contrast, simpler models consistently outperform LLMs while requiring far fewer parameters. Furthermore, we analyze existing reprogramming techniques and show, through data manifold analysis, that these methods fail to effectively align time series data with language and display "pseudo-alignment" behavior in embedding space. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLM based methods in time series tasks arises from the intrinsic characteristics and structure of time series data, rather than any meaningful alignment with the language model architecture.</p></details> |  | None |

Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks and abnormal behaviors. To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale AI/ML systems.</p></details> | IWQoS 2025 | None |

We apply it to create a background data template for weakly-supervised searches at the LHC. The method smoothly transforms sideband events to match signal region mass distributions. We demonstrate the performance of TRANSIT using the LHC Olympics R\&D dataset. The model captures non-linear mass correlations of features and produces a template that offers a competitive anomaly sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art transport-based template generators. Moreover, the computational training time required for TRANSIT is an order of magnitude lower than that of competing deep learning methods. This makes it ideal for analyses that iterate over many signal regions and signal models. Unlike generative models, which must learn a full probability density distribution, i.e., the correlations between all the variables, the proposed transport model only has to learn a smooth conditional shift of the distribution. This allows for a simpler, more efficient residual architecture, enabling mass uncorrelated features to pass the network unchanged while the mass correlated features are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, we show that the latent space of the model provides a set of mass decorrelated features useful for anomaly detection without background sculpting.</p></details> | 37 pages, 15 figures | None |

Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation protocols through comprehensive experimental analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish averaged AUC/AP metrics over multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods primarily focus on homogeneous GAD and thus fail to address three key issues: (C1) Capturing abnormal signal and rich semantics across diverse meta-paths; (C2) Retaining high-frequency content in HIN dimension alignment; and (C3) Learning effectively from difficult anomaly samples with class imbalance. To overcome these, we propose ChiGAD, a spectral GNN framework based on a novel Chi-Square filter, inspired by the wavelet effectiveness in diverse domains. Specifically, ChiGAD consists of: (1) Multi-Graph Chi-Square Filter, which captures anomalous information via applying dedicated Chi-Square filters to each meta-path graph; (2) Interactive Meta-Graph Convolution, which aligns features while preserving high-frequency information and incorporates heterogeneous messages by a unified Chi-Square Filter; and (3) Contribution-Informed Cross-Entropy Loss, which prioritizes difficult anomalies to address class imbalance. Extensive experiments on public and industrial datasets show that ChiGAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple metrics. Additionally, its homogeneous variant, ChiGNN, excels on seven GAD datasets, validating the effectiveness of Chi-Square filters.

Traditional methods for document alignment rely on image-based features like keypoints, edges, and textures to estimate geometric transformations, such as homographies. However, these approaches often require access to the original document images, which may not always be available due to privacy, storage, or transmission constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) outputs as features for homography estimation. By utilizing the spatial positions and textual content of OCR-detected words, our method enables document alignment without relying on pixel-level image data. This technique is particularly valuable in scenarios where only OCR outputs are accessible. Furthermore, the method is robust to OCR noise, incorporating RANSAC to handle outliers and inaccuracies in the OCR data. On a set of test documents, we demonstrate that our OCR-based approach even performs more accurately than traditional image-based methods, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for document registration tasks. The proposed method facilitates applications in document processing, all while reducing reliance on high-dimensional image data.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances have utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn effective node representations by aggregating information from neighborhoods. This is motivated by the hypothesis that nodes in the graph tend to exhibit consistent behaviors with their neighborhoods. However, such consistency can be disrupted by graph anomalies in multiple ways. Most existing methods directly employ GNNs to learn representations, disregarding the negative impact of graph anomalies on GNNs, resulting in sub-optimal node representations and anomaly detection performance. While a few recent approaches have redesigned GNNs for graph anomaly detection under semi-supervised label guidance, how to address the adverse effects of graph anomalies on GNNs in unsupervised scenarios and learn effective representations for anomaly detection are still under-explored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for Guarding Graph Neural Networks for Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection (G3AD). Specifically, G3AD first introduces two auxiliary networks along with correlation constraints to guard the GNNs against inconsistent information encoding. Furthermore, G3AD introduces an adaptive caching module to guard the GNNs from directly reconstructing the observed graph data that contains anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our G3AD can outperform twenty state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world graph anomaly datasets, with flexible generalization ability in different GNN backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TNNLS (14 pages, 10 figures)</p></details> | None |

Addressing this challenge requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean (G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena are crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference and URSI Radio Science Letters (RSL)</p></details> | None |

Timely prediction of agitation can enable early intervention, reduce caregiver burden, and improve the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. This study aimed to develop and benchmark machine learning approaches for the early prediction of agitation in community-dwelling older adults with dementia using multimodal sensor data. A new set of agitation-related contextual features derived from activity data was introduced and employed for agitation prediction. A wide range of machine learning and deep learning models was evaluated across multiple problem formulations, including binary classification for single-timestamp tabular sensor data and multi-timestamp sequential sensor data, as well as anomaly detection for single-timestamp tabular sensor data. The study utilized the Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) dataset, the largest publicly available dataset for remote monitoring of people living with dementia, comprising 2,803 days of in-home activity, physiology, and sleep data. The most effective setting involved binary classification of sensor data using the current 6-hour timestamp to predict agitation at the subsequent timestamp. Incorporating additional information, such as time of day and agitation history, further improved model performance, with the highest AUC-ROC of 0.9720 and AUC-PR of 0.4320 achieved by the light gradient boosting machine. This work presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques for agitation prediction in community-based dementia care using privacy-preserving sensor data.

Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks.

However, the valuable and often proprietary nature of the knowledge bases used in RAG introduces the risk of unauthorized usage by adversaries. Existing methods that can be generalized as watermarking techniques to protect these knowledge bases typically involve poisoning or backdoor attacks. However, these methods require altering the LLM's results of verification samples, inevitably making these watermarks susceptible to anomaly detection and even introducing new security risks. To address these challenges, we propose \name{} for `harmless' copyright protection of knowledge bases. Instead of manipulating LLM's final output, \name{} implants distinct yet benign verification behaviors in the space of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, maintaining the correctness of the final answer. Our method has three main stages: (1) Generating CoTs: For each verification question, we generate two `innocent' CoTs, including a target CoT for building watermark behaviors; (2) Optimizing Watermark Phrases and Target CoTs: Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we optimize them to minimize retrieval errors under the \emph{black-box} and \emph{text-only} setting of suspicious LLM, ensuring that only watermarked verification queries can retrieve their correspondingly target CoTs contained in the knowledge base; (3) Ownership Verification: We exploit a pairwise Wilcoxon test to verify whether a suspicious LLM is augmented with the protected knowledge base by comparing its responses to watermarked and benign verification queries. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} effectively protects knowledge bases and its resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work. 25 pages</p></details> | None |

Existing methods typically rely on contrastive learning, assuming that a lower similarity between a node and its local subgraph indicates abnormality. However, these approaches overlook a crucial limitation: the presence of interfering edges invalidates this assumption, since it introduces disruptive noise that compromises the contrastive learning process. Consequently, this limitation impairs the ability to effectively learn meaningful representations of normal patterns, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a Clean-View Enhanced Graph Anomaly Detection framework (CVGAD), which includes a multi-scale anomaly awareness module to identify key sources of interference in the contrastive learning process. Moreover, to mitigate bias from the one-step edge removal process, we introduce a novel progressive purification module. This module incrementally refines the graph by iteratively identifying and removing interfering edges, thereby enhancing model performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

TAD-Bench integrates multiple datasets spanning different domains, combining state-of-the-art embeddings from large language models with a variety of anomaly detection algorithms. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the interplay between embeddings and detection methods, uncovering their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to different tasks. These findings offer new perspectives on building more robust, efficient, and generalizable anomaly detection systems for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection Fused Unified Nonconvex Tensor Ring Factors Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17881v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR) factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing CLIP-based methods attempt to activate the model's ZSAD potential via handcrafted or static learnable prompts. The former incur high engineering costs and limited semantic coverage, whereas the latter apply identical descriptions across diverse anomaly types, thus fail to adapt to complex variations. Furthermore, since CLIP is originally pretrained on large-scale classification tasks, its anomaly segmentation quality is highly sensitive to the exact wording of class names, severely constraining prompting strategies that depend on class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce ViP$^{2}$-CLIP. The key insight of ViP$^{2}$-CLIP is a Visual-Perception Prompting (ViP-Prompt) mechanism, which fuses global and multi-scale local visual context to adaptively generate fine-grained textual prompts, eliminating manual templates and class-name priors. This design enables our model to focus on precise abnormal regions, making it particularly valuable when category labels are ambiguous or privacy-constrained. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that ViP$^{2}$-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust cross-domain generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

| **[Enhancing Large-Scale AI Training Efficiency: The C4 Solution for Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Communication Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04594v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the adoption of distributed training techniques, involving the deployment of thousands of GPUs to train a single model. Unfortunately, the efficiency of large-scale distributed training systems is often suboptimal due to the increased likelihood of hardware errors in high-end GPU products and the heightened risk of network traffic collisions. Moreover, any local hardware failure can disrupt training tasks, and the inability to swiftly identify faulty components leads to a significant waste of GPU resources. And, prolonged communication due to traffic collisions can substantially increase GPU waiting times. To address these challenges, we propose a communication-driven solution, namely the C4. The key insights of C4 are twofold. First, the load in distributed training exhibits homogeneous characteristics and is divided into iterations through periodic synchronization, therefore hardware anomalies would incur certain syndrome in collective communication. By leveraging this feature, C4 can rapidly identify the faulty components, swiftly isolate the anomaly, and restart the task, thereby avoiding resource wastage caused by delays in anomaly detection. Second, the predictable communication model of collective communication, involving a limited number of long-lived flows, allows C4 to efficiently execute traffic planning, substantially reducing bandwidth competition among these flows. The C4 has been extensively deployed across real-world production systems in a hyperscale cloud provider, yielding a significant improvement in system efficiency, from 30% to 45%. This enhancement is attributed to a 30% reduction in error-induced overhead and a 15% reduction in communication costs.</p></details> |  | None |

Although there has been significant coverage of their individual capabilities, our literature survey sheds some light on the integration and interaction of LLMs and IoT devices - a mutualistic relationship in which both parties leverage the capabilities of the other. LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini/BERT, any many more, all demonstrate powerful capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, enabling more intuitive and context-aware interactions across diverse IoT applications such as smart cities, healthcare systems, industrial automation, and smart home environments. Despite these opportunities, integrating these resource-intensive LLMs into IoT devices that lack the state-of-the-art computational power is a challenging task. The security of these edge devices is another major concern as they can easily act as a backdoor to private networks if the LLM integration is sloppy and unsecured. This literature survey systematically explores the current state-of-the-art in applying LLMs within IoT, emphasizing their applications in various domains/sectors of society, the significant role they play in enhancing IoT security through anomaly detection and threat mitigation, and strategies for effective deployment using edge computing frameworks. Finally, this survey highlights existing challenges, identifies future research directions, and underscores the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration to fully realize the transformative potential of integrating LLMs and IoT.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Center-aware Residual Anomaly Synthesis for Multi-class Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17551v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the inspection of industrial images. Most existing methods require separate models for each category, resulting in multiplied deployment costs. This highlights the challenge of developing a unified model for multi-class anomaly detection. However, the significant increase in inter-class interference leads to severe missed detections. Furthermore, the intra-class overlap between normal and abnormal samples, particularly in synthesis-based methods, cannot be ignored and may lead to over-detection. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Center-aware Residual Anomaly Synthesis (CRAS) method for multi-class anomaly detection. CRAS leverages center-aware residual learning to couple samples from different categories into a unified center, mitigating the effects of inter-class interference. To further reduce intra-class overlap, CRAS introduces distance-guided anomaly synthesis that adaptively adjusts noise variance based on normal data distribution. Experimental results on diverse datasets and real-world industrial applications demonstrate the superior detection accuracy and competitive inference speed of CRAS.

Existing methods are often constrained by reliance on handcrafted features, domain-specific limitations, or dependence on iterative user interaction. We address these limitations through an architecture combining deep feature extraction with unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a pre-trained Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT), paired with a Feature Fusion Mechanism (FFM), to generate representations from variable-length audio loops. These embeddings are processed using one-class Deep Support Vector Data Description (Deep SVDD), which learns normative audio patterns by mapping them to a compact latent hypersphere. Evaluations on curated bass and guitar datasets compare standard and residual autoencoder variants against baselines like Isolation Forest (IF) and and principle component analysis (PCA) methods. Results show our Deep SVDD models, especially the residual autoencoder variant, deliver improved anomaly separation, particularly for larger variations. This research contributes a flexible, fully unsupervised solution for processing diverse audio samples, overcoming previous structural and input limitations while enabling effective pattern identification through distance-based latent space scoring.</p></details> | 27 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process, improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features. Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies.

A time series motif is a short trace segment which may implicitly capture an underlying phenomenon within the time series. Specifically, we focus on glucose traces collected from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which inherently contain motifs representing underlying human behaviors such as eating and exercise. The ability to identify and quantify \textit{causal} relationships amongst motifs can provide a mechanism to better understand and represent these patterns, useful for improving deep learning and generative models and for advanced technology development (e.g., personalized coaching and artificial insulin delivery systems). However, no previous work has developed causal discovery methods for time series motifs. Therefore, in this paper we develop MotifDisco (\textbf{motif} \textbf{disco}very of causality), a novel causal discovery framework to learn causal relations amongst motifs from time series traces. We formalize a notion of \textit{Motif Causality (MC)}, inspired from Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy, and develop a Graph Neural Network-based framework that learns causality between motifs by solving an unsupervised link prediction problem. We integrate MC with three model use cases of forecasting, anomaly detection and clustering, to showcase the use of MC as a building block for downstream tasks. Finally, we evaluate our framework on different health data streams and find that Motif Causality provides a significant performance improvement in all use cases.</p></details> |  | None |

Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.</p></details> | 11 pages, ICML 2025 | None |

Although numerous studies have proposed machine learning (ML) methods for this purpose, limited research systematically examines how different preprocessing steps--normalization, transformation, and feature selection--interact with distinct model architectures. To address this gap, this paper presents a multi-step evaluation framework assessing the combined impact of preprocessing choices on three ML algorithms: RNN-LSTM, autoencoder neural networks (ANN), and Gradient Boosting (GBoosting). Experiments on the IoTID20 dataset shows that GBoosting consistently delivers superior accuracy across preprocessing configurations, while RNN-LSTM shows notable gains with z-score normalization and autoencoders excel in recall, making them well-suited for unsupervised scenarios. By offering a structured analysis of preprocessing decisions and their interplay with various ML techniques, the proposed framework provides actionable guidance to enhance anomaly detection performance in IoT environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Anomaly detection in battery thermal images helps identify failures early, but traditional deep learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially for anomalies due to safety risks and high data collection costs. To overcome this, we explore zero-shot anomaly detection using Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, which leverage pretrained knowledge and textbased prompts to generalize across vision tasks. By incorporating prior knowledge of normal battery thermal behavior, we design prompts to detect anomalies without battery-specific training data. We evaluate three VQA models (ChatGPT-4o, LLaVa-13b, and BLIP-2) analyzing their robustness to prompt variations, repeated trials, and qualitative outputs. Despite the lack of finetuning on battery data, our approach demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models that are trained with the battery data. Our findings highlight the potential of VQA-based zero-shot learning for battery anomaly detection and suggest future directions for improving its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> | None |

Few-shot learning has emerged as a promising approach to alleviate these limitations by leveraging the large-scale prior knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs). Recent advancements in few-shot medical AD have treated normal and abnormal cases as a one-class classification problem, often overlooking the distinction among multiple anomaly categories. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework tailored for few-shot medical anomaly detection in the scenario where the identification of multiple anomaly categories is required. To capture the detailed radiological signs of medical anomaly categories, our framework incorporates diverse textual descriptions for each category generated by a Large-Language model, under the assumption that different anomalies in medical images may share common radiological signs in each category. Specifically, we introduce SD-MAD, a two-stage Sign-Driven few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection framework: (i) Radiological signs are aligned with anomaly categories by amplifying inter-anomaly discrepancy; (ii) Aligned signs are selected further to mitigate the effect of the under-fitting and uncertain-sample issue caused by limited medical data, employing an automatic sign selection strategy at inference. Moreover, we propose three protocols to comprehensively quantify the performance of multi-anomaly detection. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

The solutions available today for spoofing detection either rely on additional communication systems, receivers, and antennas, or require mobile deployments. Detection systems working at the Physical (PHY) layer of the satellite communication link also require time-consuming and energy-hungry training processes on all satellites of the constellation, and rely on the availability of spoofed data, which are often challenging to collect. Moreover, none of such contributions investigate the feasibility of aerial spoofing attacks launched via drones operating at various altitudes. In this paper, we propose a new spoofing detection technique for LEO satellite constellation systems, applying anomaly detection on the received PHY signal via autoencoders. We validate our solution through an extensive measurement campaign involving the deployment of an actual spoofer (Software-Defined Radio) installed on a drone and injecting rogue IRIDIUM messages while flying at different altitudes with various movement patterns. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique can reliably detect LEO spoofing attacks launched at different altitudes, while state-of-the-art competing approaches simply fail. We also release the collected data as open source, fostering further research on satellite security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication by Elsevier Computer Networks</p></details> | None |

To address the challenge of analyzing such adversarial networks while preserving the privacy of distributed intelligence data, we propose a Privacy-Aware Federated Graph Neural Network (PA-FGNN) framework. PA-FGNN integrates graph attention networks, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption into a robust federated learning pipeline tailored for cyberterrorism network analysis. Each client trains locally on sensitive graph data and exchanges encrypted, noise-perturbed model updates with a central aggregator, which performs secure aggregation and broadcasts global updates. We implement anomaly detection for flagging high-risk nodes and incorporate defenses against gradient poisoning. Experimental evaluations on simulated dark web and cyber-intelligence graphs demonstrate that PA-FGNN achieves over 91\% classification accuracy, maintains resilience under 20\% adversarial client behavior, and incurs less than 18\% communication overhead.

This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning-based framework for anomaly detection in encrypted network traffic. This study proposes a model-agnostic framework that integrates multiple machine learning classifiers, with SHapley Additive exPlanations SHAP to ensure post-hoc model interpretability. The models are trained and evaluated on three benchmark encrypted traffic datasets. Performance is assessed using standard classification metrics, and SHAP is used to explain model predictions by attributing importance to individual input features. SHAP visualizations successfully revealed the most influential traffic features contributing to anomaly predictions, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of the models. Unlike conventional approaches that treat machine learning as a black box, this work combines robust classification techniques with explainability through SHAP, offering a novel interpretable anomaly detection system tailored for encrypted traffic environments. While the framework is generalizable, real-time deployment and performance under adversarial conditions require further investigation. Future work may explore adaptive models and real-time interpretability in operational network environments. This interpretable anomaly detection framework can be integrated into modern security operations for encrypted environments, allowing analysts not only to detect anomalies with high precision but also to understand why a model made a particular decision a crucial capability in compliance-driven and mission-critical settings.</p></details> |  | None |

Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models.

Effective anomaly detection is crucial for providing operators with a clear understanding of each node's availability, status, and potential problems, thereby ensuring smooth accelerator operation. Traditional and learning-based anomaly detection methods face significant limitations due to the sequential nature of these logs and the lack of a rich, node-specific text corpus. To address this, we propose an approach utilizing word embeddings to represent log entries and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the typical sequential patterns of these embeddings for individual nodes. Anomalies are identified by scoring individual log entries based on a probability ratio: this ratio compares the likelihood of the log sequence including the new entry against its likelihood without it, effectively measuring how well the new entry fits the established pattern. High scores indicate potential anomalies that deviate from the node's routine behavior. This method functions as a warning system, alerting operators to irregular log events that may signify underlying issues, thereby facilitating proactive intervention.</p></details> |  | None |

However, three fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |

To address these challenges, our TRACE framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Gated DSIC (Gated Dynamic Simulation Importance Calculation), an unbiased LoRA module importance selection mechanism that ensures conditional parameter consistency before and after masking. Experiments demonstrate that Gated DSIC outperforms common fine-tuning. (2) Reconstructed prediction heads for long-term forecasting tasks, which achieve comparable or superior performance to linear probing heads while drastically reducing parameter counts. Extensive experiments on long-/short-term forecasting, anomaly detection and natural language tasks across diverse datasets, coupled with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Anomaly Detection Based on Critical Paths for Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14967v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notoriously hard to understand and difficult to defend. Extracting representative paths (including the neuron activation values and the connections between neurons) from DNNs using software engineering approaches has recently shown to be a promising approach in interpreting the decision making process of blackbox DNNs, as the extracted paths are often effective in capturing essential features. With this in mind, this work investigates a novel approach that extracts critical paths from DNNs and subsequently applies the extracted paths for the anomaly detection task, based on the observation that outliers and adversarial inputs do not usually induce the same activation pattern on those paths as normal (in-distribution) inputs. In our approach, we first identify critical detection paths via genetic evolution and mutation. Since different paths in a DNN often capture different features for the same target class, we ensemble detection results from multiple paths by integrating random subspace sampling and a voting mechanism. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results suggest that our method not only outperforms them, but it is also suitable for the detection of a broad range of anomaly types with high accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages in ACM journal latex format</p></details> | None |
| **[Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14033v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2025 February Cycle</p></details> | None |

Logical anomalies may appear visually normal yet violate predefined constraints on object presence, arrangement, or quantity, depending on reasoning and explainability. We introduce LogicQA, a framework that enhances AD by providing industrial operators with explanations for logical anomalies. LogicQA compiles automatically generated questions into a checklist and collects responses to identify violations of logical constraints. LogicQA is training-free, annotation-free, and operates in a few-shot setting. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) Logical AD performance on public benchmarks, MVTec LOCO AD, with an AUROC of 87.6 percent and an F1-max of 87.0 percent along with the explanations of anomalies.

This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by 12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information. The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASME ...</summary><p>ASME 2025 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE2025, August 17-20, 2025, Anaheim, CA (IDETC2025-168615)</p></details> | None |

We believe that unsupervised techniques are the best choice for our purposes because the data used to train the detector does not need to be manually labeled, and instead, the machine is intended to detect by itself the anomalies in the dataset, which liberates the user of tedious, time-consuming initial image examination. The structure must, additionally, provide the user with some measure of uncertainty in the detection, so the user can take decisions based on this measure.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[View-Invariant Pixelwise Anomaly Detection in Multi-object Scenes with Adaptive View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18012v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The built environment, encompassing critical infrastructure such as bridges and buildings, requires diligent monitoring of unexpected anomalies or deviations from a normal state in captured imagery. Anomaly detection methods could aid in automating this task; however, deploying anomaly detection effectively in such environments presents significant challenges that have not been evaluated before. These challenges include camera viewpoints that vary, the presence of multiple objects within a scene, and the absence of labeled anomaly data for training. To address these comprehensively, we introduce and formalize Scene Anomaly Detection (Scene AD) as the task of unsupervised, pixel-wise anomaly localization under these specific real-world conditions. Evaluating progress in Scene AD required the development of ToyCity, the first multi-object, multi-view real-image dataset, for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our initial evaluations using ToyCity revealed that established anomaly detection baselines struggle to achieve robust pixel-level localization. To address this, two data augmentation strategies were created to generate additional synthetic images of non-anomalous regions to enhance generalizability. However, the addition of these synthetic images alone only provided minor improvements. Thus, OmniAD, a refinement of the Reverse Distillation methodology, was created to establish a stronger baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that OmniAD, when used with augmented views, yields a 64.33\% increase in pixel-wise \(F_1\) score over Reverse Distillation with no augmentation. Collectively, this work offers the Scene AD task definition, the ToyCity benchmark, the view synthesis augmentation approaches, and the OmniAD method.

While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages excluding appendix</p></details> | None |

A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TSPulse: Dual Space Tiny Pre-Trained Models for Rapid Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13033v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters, making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structure-based Anomaly Detection and Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12751v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data. MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation at Politecnico di Milano</p></details> | None |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining, and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical applications in AD.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods like the Anomaly Transformer and DCdetector have progressed, but they face limitations such as sensitivity to short-term contexts and inefficiency in noisy, non-stationary environments. To overcome these issues, we introduce MAAT, an improved architecture that enhances association discrepancy modeling and reconstruction quality. MAAT features Sparse Attention, efficiently capturing long-range dependencies by focusing on relevant time steps, thereby reducing computational redundancy. Additionally, a Mamba-Selective State Space Model is incorporated into the reconstruction module, utilizing a skip connection and Gated Attention to improve anomaly localization and detection performance. Extensive experiments show that MAAT significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving better anomaly distinguishability and generalization across various time series applications, setting a new standard for unsupervised time series anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

The collection comprises six distinct datasets with over 34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled experimental conditions, capturing the multifaceted nature of screw driving processes in plastic components. Each dataset systematically investigates specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use (s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types (s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware specifications, process phases, and data acquisition methods. The hierarchical data model preserves the temporal and operational structure of screw driving processes, facilitating both exploratory analysis and the development of machine learning models. To maximize accessibility, we provide dual access pathways: raw data through Zenodo with a persistent DOI, and a purpose-built Python library (PyScrew) that offers consistent interfaces for data loading, preprocessing, and integration with common analysis workflows. These datasets serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology evaluation, and classification of specific error conditions.

However, previous generative-based models have been limited by suboptimal reconstruction quality, hampering their overall performance. We introduce DiffusionAD, a novel anomaly detection pipeline comprising a reconstruction sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. A fundamental enhancement lies in our reformulation of the reconstruction process using a diffusion model into a noise-to-norm paradigm. Here, the anomalous region loses its distinctive features after being disturbed by Gaussian noise and is subsequently reconstructed into an anomaly-free one. Afterward, the segmentation sub-network predicts pixel-level anomaly scores based on the similarities and discrepancies between the input image and its anomaly-free reconstruction. Additionally, given the substantial decrease in inference speed due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models, we revisit the denoising process and introduce a rapid one-step denoising paradigm. This paradigm achieves hundreds of times acceleration while preserving comparable reconstruction quality. Furthermore, considering the diversity in the manifestation of anomalies, we propose a norm-guided paradigm to integrate the benefits of multiple noise scales, enhancing the fidelity of reconstructions. Comprehensive evaluations on four standard and challenging benchmarks reveal that DiffusionAD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches and achieves comparable inference speed, demonstrating the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed pipeline.

| **[Robust outlier detection for heterogeneous distributions applicable to censoring in functional MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11806v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are prone to intense "burst" noise artifacts due to head movements and other sources. Such volumes can be considered as high-dimensional outliers that can be identified using statistical outlier detection techniques, which allows for controlling the false positive rate. Previous work has used dimension reduction and multivariate outlier detection techniques, including the use of robust minimum covariance determinant (MCD) distances. Under Gaussianity, the distribution of these robust distances can be approximated, and an upper quantile of that distribution can be used to identify outlying volumes. Unfortunately, the Gaussian assumption is unrealistic for fMRI data in this context. One way to address this is to transform the data to Normality. A limitation of existing robust methods for this purpose, such as robust Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations, is that they can deal with skew but not heavy or light tails. Here, we develop a novel robust method for transformation to central Normality based on the highly flexible sinh-arcsinh (SHASH) family of distributions. To avoid the influence of outliers, it is crucial to initialize the outlier labels with a high degree of sensitivity. For this purpose, we consider a commonplace robust z-score approach, and a modified isolation forest (iForest) approach, a popular technique for anomaly detection in machine learning. Through extensive simulation studies, we find that our proposed SHASH transformation initialized using iForest clearly outperforms benchmark methods in a variety of settings, including skewed and heavy tailed distributions, and light to heavy outlier contamination. We also apply the proposed techniques to several example datasets and find this combination to have consistently strong performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Are vision language models robust to uncertain inputs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11804v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness against uncertain and ambiguous inputs is a critical challenge for deep learning models. While recent advancements in large scale vision language models (VLMs, e.g. GPT4o) might suggest that increasing model and training dataset size would mitigate this issue, our empirical evaluation shows a more complicated picture. Testing models using two classic uncertainty quantification tasks, anomaly detection and classification under inherently ambiguous conditions, we find that newer and larger VLMs indeed exhibit improved robustness compared to earlier models, but still suffer from a tendency to strictly follow instructions, often causing them to hallucinate confident responses even when faced with unclear or anomalous inputs. Remarkably, for natural images such as ImageNet, this limitation can be overcome without pipeline modifications: simply prompting models to abstain from uncertain predictions enables significant reliability gains, achieving near-perfect robustness in several settings. However, for domain-specific tasks such as galaxy morphology classification, a lack of specialized knowledge prevents reliable uncertainty estimation. Finally, we propose a novel mechanism based on caption diversity to reveal a model's internal uncertainty, enabling practitioners to predict when models will successfully abstain without relying on labeled data.</p></details> |  | None |

Biological neural networks can actively forget history knowledge that conflicts with the learning of new experiences by regulating learning-triggered synaptic expansion and synaptic convergence. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Biologically-Inspired Continual Learning Generative Adversarial Network (CL-BioGAN) for augmenting continuous distribution fitting ability for cross-domain HAD task, where Continual Learning Bio-inspired Loss (CL-Bio Loss) and self-attention Generative Adversarial Network (BioGAN) are incorporated to realize forgetting history knowledge as well as involving replay strategy in the proposed BioGAN. Specifically, a novel Bio-Inspired Loss composed with an Active Forgetting Loss (AF Loss) and a CL loss is designed to realize parameters releasing and enhancing between new task and history tasks from a Bayesian perspective. Meanwhile, BioGAN loss with L2-Norm enhances self-attention (SA) to further balance the stability and flexibility for better fitting background distribution for open scenario HAD (OHAD) tasks. Experiment results underscore that the proposed CL-BioGAN can achieve more robust and satisfying accuracy for cross-domain HAD with fewer parameters and computation cost. This dual contribution not only elevates CL performance but also offers new insights into neural adaptation mechanisms in OHAD task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the limited prior information and the catastrophic forgetting problem indicate crucial challenges for existing DL structure in open scenarios cross-domain detection. In order to improve the detection performance, a novel continual learning-based capsule differential generative adversarial network (CL-CaGAN) is proposed to elevate the cross-scenario learning performance for facilitating the real application of DL-based structure in hyperspectral AD (HAD) task. First, a modified capsule structure with adversarial learning network is constructed to estimate the background distribution for surmounting the deficiency of prior information. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, clustering-based sample replay strategy and a designed extra self-distillation regularization are integrated for merging the history and future knowledge in continual AD task, while the discriminative learning ability from previous detection scenario to current scenario is retained by the elaborately designed structure with continual learning (CL) strategy. In addition, the differentiable enhancement is enforced to augment the generation performance of the training data. This further stabilizes the training process with better convergence and efficiently consolidates the reconstruction ability of background samples. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed CL-CaGAN, we conduct experiments on several real HSIs, and the results indicate that the proposed CL-CaGAN demonstrates higher detection performance and continuous learning capacity for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting under cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Conditionally Activated Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning with Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04055v5)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as model poisoning and backdoor attacks. However, existing defense mechanisms often fall short in real-world settings due to key limitations: they may rely on impractical assumptions, introduce distortions by modifying aggregation functions, or degrade model performance even in benign scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel anomaly detection method designed specifically for practical FL scenarios. Our approach employs a two-stage, conditionally activated detection mechanism: cross-round check first detects whether suspicious activity has occurred, and, if warranted, a cross-client check filters out malicious participants. This mechanism preserves utility while avoiding unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, to ensure the transparency and integrity of the defense mechanism, we incorporate zero-knowledge proofs, enabling clients to verify the detection without relying solely on the server's goodwill. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to bridge the gap between theoretical advances in FL security and the demands of real-world deployment. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and real-world edge devices demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods of failure detection are often difficult to cope with the scale and dynamics of modern cloud environments. In this study, we propose a novel AI framework based on Massive Language Model (LLM) for intelligent fault detection and self-healing mechanisms in cloud systems. The model combines existing machine learning fault detection algorithms with LLM's natural language understanding capabilities to process and parse system logs, error reports, and real-time data streams through semantic context. The method adopts a multi-level architecture, combined with supervised learning for fault classification and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, so that the system can predict potential failures before they occur and automatically trigger the self-healing mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than the traditional fault detection system in terms of fault detection accuracy, system downtime reduction and recovery speed.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Benchmarking Anomaly Detection Algorithms: Deep Learning and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07281v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection of anomalous situations for complex mission-critical systems hold paramount importance when their service continuity needs to be ensured. A major challenge in detecting anomalies from the operational data arises due to the imbalanced class distribution problem since the anomalies are supposed to be rare events. This paper evaluates a diverse array of Machine Learning (ML)-based anomaly detection algorithms through a comprehensive benchmark study. The paper contributes significantly by conducting an unbiased comparison of various anomaly detection algorithms, spanning classical ML, including various tree-based approaches to Deep Learning (DL) and outlier detection methods. The inclusion of 104 publicly available enhances the diversity of the study, allowing a more realistic evaluation of algorithm performance and emphasizing the importance of adaptability to real-world scenarios. The paper evaluates the general notion of DL as a universal solution, showing that, while powerful, it is not always the best fit for every scenario. The findings reveal that recently proposed tree-based evolutionary algorithms match DL methods and sometimes outperform them in many instances of univariate data where the size of the data is small and number of anomalies are less than 10%. Specifically, tree-based approaches successfully detect singleton anomalies in datasets where DL falls short. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a study on a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms using diverse data sets, with the objective of guiding researchers and practitioners in making informed algorithmic choices, has not been attempted earlier.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN. Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EIAD: Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Via Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14162v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical to ensure product quality during manufacturing. Although existing zero-shot defect segmentation and detection methods have shown effectiveness, they cannot provide detailed descriptions of the defects. Furthermore, the application of large multi-modal models in IAD remains in its infancy, facing challenges in balancing question-answering (QA) performance and mask-based grounding capabilities, often owing to overfitting during the fine-tuning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that introduces a dedicated multi-modal defect localization module to decouple the dialog functionality from the core feature extraction. This decoupling is achieved through independent optimization objectives and tailored learning strategies. Additionally, we contribute to the first multi-modal industrial anomaly detection training dataset, named Defect Detection Question Answering (DDQA), encompassing a wide range of defect types and industrial scenarios. Unlike conventional datasets that rely on GPT-generated data, DDQA ensures authenticity and reliability and offers a robust foundation for model training. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Assistant (EIAD), achieves outstanding performance in defect detection and localization tasks. It not only significantly enhances accuracy but also improves interpretability. These advancements highlight the potential of EIAD for practical applications in industrial settings.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 | None |
| **[A Radon-Nikodým Perspective on Anomaly Detection: Theory and Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18002v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Which principle underpins the design of an effective anomaly detection loss function? The answer lies in the concept of Radon-Nikod\'ym theorem, a fundamental concept in measure theory. The key insight from this article is: Multiplying the vanilla loss function with the Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative improves the performance across the board. We refer to this as RN-Loss. We prove this using the setting of PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learnability. Depending on the context a Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes different forms. In the simplest case of supervised anomaly detection, Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes the form of a simple weighted loss. In the case of unsupervised anomaly detection (with distributional assumptions), Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes the form of the popular cluster based local outlier factor. We evaluate our algorithm on 96 datasets, including univariate and multivariate data from diverse domains, including healthcare, cybersecurity, and finance. We show that RN-Derivative algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods on 68% of Multivariate datasets (based on F1 scores) and also achieves peak F1-scores on 72% of time series (Univariate) datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

The novel framework consists of two components, a Stacked Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (SREnc-Dec) module that captures temporal features in a latent space, and a Multi-Receptive-field Wavelet Probabilistic Network (MRWPN) that creates an ensemble probabilistic model to characterise the latent space. This formulation extends the standard wavelet probabilistic networks to wavelet deep probabilistic networks, which can handle higher data dimensionality. The MRWPN module can adapt to different rates of data variation in different datasets without imposing strong distribution assumptions, resulting in a more robust and accurate detection for Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) tasks in the non-stationary environment. We carry out the assessment on 45 real-world time series datasets from various domains, verify the performance of RWPNN in TSAD tasks with several constraints, and show its ability to provide early warnings for anomalous events.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing techniques tend to be specialized in individual scenarios and lack generalization capacities. In this study, our objective is to develop a generic anomaly detection model that can be applied in multiple scenarios. To achieve this, we custom-build generic visual language foundation models that possess extensive knowledge and robust reasoning abilities as anomaly detectors and reasoners. Specifically, we introduce a multi-modal prompting strategy that incorporates domain knowledge from experts as conditions to guide the models. Our approach considers diverse prompt types, including task descriptions, class context, normality rules, and reference images. In addition, we unify the input representation of multi-modality into a 2D image format, enabling multi-modal anomaly detection and reasoning. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that combining visual and language prompts as conditions for customizing the models enhances anomaly detection performance. The customized models showcase the ability to detect anomalies across different data modalities such as images, point clouds, and videos. Qualitative case studies further highlight the anomaly detection and reasoning capabilities, particularly for multi-object scenes and temporal data.

Traditional models have limitations in dealing with these complex data, and it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for analysis. In recent years, Diffusion Model, as an emerging generative model, has shown unique advantages in hyperspectral image processing. By simulating the diffusion process of data in time, the Diffusion Model can effectively process high-dimensional data, generate high-quality samples, and perform well in denoising and data enhancement. In this paper, we review the recent research advances in diffusion modeling for hyperspectral image processing and analysis, and discuss its applications in tasks such as high-dimensional data processing, noise removal, classification, and anomaly detection. The performance of diffusion-based models on image processing is compared and the challenges are summarized. It is shown that the diffusion model can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral image analysis, providing a new direction for future research.</p></details> | 33 pages,20 figures | None |
| **[Towards Anomaly-Aware Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning for Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14250v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has garnered increasing attention in recent years, yet remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) label scarcity stemming from the high cost of annotations and (2) homophily disparity at node and class levels. In this paper, we introduce Anomaly-Aware Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning (APF), a targeted and effective framework to mitigate the above challenges in GAD. In the pre-training stage, APF incorporates node-specific subgraphs selected via the Rayleigh Quotient, a label-free anomaly metric, into the learning objective to enhance anomaly awareness. It further introduces two learnable spectral polynomial filters to jointly learn dual representations that capture both general semantics and subtle anomaly cues. During fine-tuning, a gated fusion mechanism adaptively integrates pre-trained representations across nodes and dimensions, while an anomaly-aware regularization loss encourages abnormal nodes to preserve more anomaly-relevant information. Furthermore, we theoretically show that APF tends to achieve linear separability under mild conditions. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of APF in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fairness-aware Anomaly Detection via Fair Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11132v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection is a critical task in many high-social-impact applications such as finance, healthcare, social media, and cybersecurity, where demographics involving age, gender, race, disease, etc, are used frequently. In these scenarios, possible bias from anomaly detection systems can lead to unfair treatment for different groups and even exacerbate social bias. In this work, first, we thoroughly analyze the feasibility and necessary assumptions for ensuring group fairness in unsupervised anomaly detection. Second, we propose a novel fairness-aware anomaly detection method FairAD. From the normal training data, FairAD learns a projection to map data of different demographic groups to a common target distribution that is simple and compact, and hence provides a reliable base to estimate the density of the data. The density can be directly used to identify anomalies while the common target distribution ensures fairness between different groups. Furthermore, we propose a threshold-free fairness metric that provides a global view for model's fairness, eliminating dependence on manual threshold selection. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an improved trade-off between detection accuracy and fairness under both balanced and skewed data across different groups.</p></details> |  | None |

Current benchmarks largely overlook this critical challenge. We introduce Multi-View Multi-Illumination Anomaly Detection (M2AD), a new large-scale benchmark comprising 119,880 high-resolution images designed explicitly to probe VAD robustness under such interacting conditions. By systematically capturing 999 specimens across 10 categories using 12 synchronized views and 10 illumination settings (120 configurations total), M2AD enables rigorous evaluation. We establish two evaluation protocols: M2AD-Synergy tests the ability to fuse information across diverse configurations, and M2AD-Invariant measures single-image robustness against realistic view-illumination effects. Our extensive benchmarking shows that state-of-the-art VAD methods struggle significantly on M2AD, demonstrating the profound challenge posed by view-illumination interplay. This benchmark serves as an essential tool for developing and validating VAD methods capable of overcoming real-world complexities.

Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these complexities, we propose ADALog, an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection framework designed for practical applicability across diverse real-world environments. Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict sequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual unstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs adaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a transformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language modeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic and semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are identified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into log-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only on normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system behaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in traditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird, and Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Additional ablation studies examine the effects of masking, fine-tuning, and token positioning on model behavior and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper accepted at ICMLT 2025; to appear in the IEEE Conference Proceedings</p></details> | None |

| **[TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11641v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates, complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second, comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service, adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods.

Existing methods for correlating mixing accounts suffer from limited labeled data and vulnerability to noisy annotations, which restrict their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose StealthLink, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through cross-task domain-invariant feature learning. Our key innovation lies in transferring knowledge from the well-studied domain of blockchain anomaly detection to the data-scarce task of mixing transaction tracing. Specifically, we design a MixFusion module that constructs and encodes mixing subgraphs to capture local transactional patterns, while introducing a knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns discriminative features across domains through adversarial discrepancy minimization. This dual approach enables robust feature learning under label scarcity and distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on real-world mixing transaction datasets demonstrate that StealthLink achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 96.98\% F1-score in 10-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our framework shows superior generalization capability in imbalanced data conditions than conventional supervised methods.

Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain.

However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language.

However, these self-attention reconstruction models primarily operate on target features, which may result in perfect reconstruction for both normal and anomaly features due to high consistency with context, leading to failure in detecting anomalies. Additionally, these models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation. OneNIP outperforms previous methods on three industry anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec, BTAD, and VisA.

| **[Few-Shot Anomaly-Driven Generation for Anomaly Classification and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09263v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a practical and challenging task due to the scarcity of anomaly samples in industrial inspection. Some existing anomaly detection methods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external data. However, there is always a large semantic gap between synthetic and real-world anomalies, resulting in weak performance in anomaly detection. To solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen) method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec. The experiments demonstrate that our generated anomalies effectively improve the model performance of both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks simultaneously, \eg, DRAEM and DseTSeg achieved a 5.8\% and 1.5\% improvement in AU-PR metric on segmentation task, respectively. The code and generated anomalous data are available at https://github.com/gaobb/AnoGen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/gaobb/AnoGen) |

In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD.

Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> | None |

However, these networks suffer from the ``black-box'' problem which makes it difficult to understand how they make decisions. In order to solve this issue, an R package called neuralGAM is introduced. This package implements a Neural Network topology based on Generalized Additive Models, allowing to fit an independent Neural Network to estimate the contribution of each feature to the output variable, yielding a highly accurate and interpretable Deep Learning model. The neuralGAM package provides a flexible framework for training Generalized Additive Neural Networks, which does not impose any restrictions on the Neural Network architecture.

| **[Isolation Forest in Novelty Detection Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08489v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data mining offers a diverse toolbox for extracting meaningful structures from complex datasets, with anomaly detection emerging as a critical subfield particularly in the context of streaming or real-time data. Within anomaly detection, novelty detection focuses on identifying previously unseen patterns after training solely on regular data. While classic algorithms such as One-Class SVM or Local Outlier Factor (LOF) have been widely applied, they often lack interpretability and scalability. In this work, we explore the Half-Space Tree (HST) algorithm, originally proposed for streaming anomaly detection, and propose a novel theoretical modification to adapt it specifically for novelty detection tasks. Our approach is grounded in the idea that anomalies i.e., novelties tend to appear in the higher leaves of the tree, which are less frequently visited by regular instances. We analytically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using probabilistic analysis, expected depth (EXD) calculations, and combinatorial reasoning. A comparative analysis of expected depths between our modified HST and the original Isolation Forest highlights that novelty points are significantly more isolated in our approach. This supports the hypothesis that HSTs, with appropriate structural adaptation, can serve as interpretable and efficient novelty detectors. The paper contributes a theoretical foundation and supporting analysis for this adaptation, setting the stage for further application and experimentation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structural-Temporal Coupling Anomaly Detection with Dynamic Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08330v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous edges in dynamic graphs is an important task in many applications over evolving triple-based data, such as social networks, transaction management, and epidemiology. A major challenge with this task is the absence of structural-temporal coupling information, which decreases the ability of the representation to distinguish anomalies from normal instances. Existing methods focus on handling independent structural and temporal features with embedding models, which ignore the deep interaction between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a structural-temporal coupling anomaly detection architecture with a dynamic graph transformer model. Specifically, we introduce structural and temporal features from two integration levels to provide anomaly-aware graph evolutionary patterns. Then, a dynamic graph transformer enhanced by two-dimensional positional encoding is implemented to capture both discrimination and contextual consistency signals. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models. Finally, a case study illustrates the strength of our method when applied to a real-world task.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures | None |

The method constructs a Gaussian mixture model parameterized by a neural network, enabling conditional probability modeling of user behavior. It effectively captures the multimodal distribution characteristics commonly present in behavioral data. Unlike traditional classifiers that rely on fixed thresholds or a single decision boundary, this approach defines an anomaly scoring function based on probability density using negative log-likelihood. This significantly enhances the model's ability to detect rare and unstructured behaviors. Experiments are conducted on the real-world network user dataset UNSW-NB15. A series of performance comparisons and stability validation experiments are designed. These cover multiple evaluation aspects, including Accuracy, F1- score, AUC, and loss fluctuation. The results show that the proposed method outperforms several advanced neural network architectures in both performance and training stability. This study provides a more expressive and discriminative solution for user behavior modeling and anomaly detection. It strongly promotes the application of deep probabilistic modeling techniques in the fields of network security and intelligent risk control.</p></details> |  | None |

The autoencoder is trained on thermal images captured from a commercial power module at randomly varied load currents and augmented image2 generated through image processing techniques such as resizing, rotation, perspective transformation, and bright and contrast adjustment. Since the autoencoder is trained to output images identical to input only for normal samples, it reconstructs images similar to normal ones even when the input images containing faults. A small heater is attached to the circuit board to simulate a fault on a power module, and then thermal images were captured from different angles and positions, as well as various load currents to test the trained autoencoder model. The areas under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the autoencoder model can detect anomalies with 100% accuracy under given conditions. The influence of hyperparameters such as the number of convolutional layers and image augmentation conditions on anomaly detection accuracy was also investigated.</p></details> |  | None |

Machine Learning-based IDS that learn from the network traffic characteristics and can discern attack patterns from benign traffic offer an advanced solution to traditional signature-based IDS. However, they heavily rely on labeled datasets, and their ability to generalize when encountering unseen traffic patterns remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised contrastive learning approach based on transformer encoders, specifically tailored for generalizable intrusion detection on raw packet sequences. Our proposed learning scheme employs a packet-level data augmentation strategy combined with a transformer-based architecture to extract and generate meaningful representations of traffic flows. Unlike traditional methods reliant on handcrafted statistical features (NetFlow), our approach automatically learns comprehensive packet sequence representations, significantly enhancing performance in anomaly identification tasks and supervised learning for intrusion detection. Our transformer-based framework exhibits better performance in comparison to existing NetFlow self-supervised methods. Specifically, we achieve up to a 3% higher AUC in anomaly detection for intra-dataset evaluation and up to 20% higher AUC scores in inter-dataset evaluation. Moreover, our model provides a strong baseline for supervised intrusion detection with limited labeled data, exhibiting an improvement over self-supervised NetFlow models of up to 1.5% AUC when pretrained and evaluated on the same dataset. Additionally, we show the adaptability of our pretrained model when fine-tuned across different datasets, demonstrating strong performance even when lacking benign data from the target domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IFIP Networking 2025.

To further improve robustness, we introduce a simple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on CARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly localization.

The huge computation and storage costs caused by the increasing product classes limit the application of single-class unsupervised methods, necessitating the development of multi-class unsupervised methods. However, the feature similarity between normal and anomalous points from different class data leads to the feature confusion problem, which greatly hinders the performance of multi-class methods. Therefore, we introduce a multi-class point cloud anomaly detection method, named GLFM, leveraging global-local feature matching to progressively separate data that are prone to confusion across multiple classes. Specifically, GLFM is structured into three stages: Stage-I proposes an anomaly synthesis pipeline that stretches point clouds to create abundant anomaly data that are utilized to adapt the point cloud feature extractor for better feature representation. Stage-II establishes the global and local memory banks according to the global and local feature distributions of all the training data, weakening the impact of feature confusion on the establishment of the memory bank. Stage-III implements anomaly detection of test data leveraging its feature distance from global and local memory banks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD, Real3D-AD and actual industry parts dataset showcase our proposed GLFM's superior point cloud anomaly detection performance.

Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation, outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients.

Without any label, deep UOD methods struggle with the misalignment between the model's direct optimization goal and the final performance goal of Outlier Detection (OD) task. Through the perspective of training dynamics, this paper proposes an early stopping algorithm to optimize the training of deep UOD models, ensuring they perform optimally in OD rather than overfitting the entire contaminated dataset. Inspired by UOD mechanism and inlier priority phenomenon, where intuitively models fit inliers more quickly than outliers, we propose GradStop, a sampling-based label-free algorithm to estimate model's real-time performance during training. First, a sampling method generates two sets: one likely containing more outliers and the other more inliers, then a metric based on gradient cohesion is applied to probe into current training dynamics, which reflects model's performance on OD task. Experimental results on 4 deep UOD algorithms and 47 real-world datasets and theoretical proofs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed early stopping algorithm in enhancing the performance of deep UOD models. Auto Encoder (AE) enhanced by GradStop achieves better performance than itself, other SOTA UOD methods, and even ensemble AEs. Our method provides a robust and effective solution to the problem of performance degradation during training, enabling deep UOD models to achieve better potential in anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

In order to address this issue, a new meth-odology for detecting surface defects in in-dustrial settings is introduced, referred to as Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling(MAPL). The methodology first in-troduces an anomaly simulation strategy, which significantly improves the model's ability to recognize rare or unknown anom-aly types by generating simulated anomaly samples. To cope with the problem of the lack of labeling of anomalous simulated samples, a pseudo-labeler method based on a one-classifier ensemble was employed in this study, which enhances the robustness of the model in the case of limited labeling data by automatically selecting key pseudo-labeling hyperparameters. Meanwhile, a memory-enhanced learning mechanism is introduced to effectively predict abnormal regions by analyzing the difference be-tween the input samples and the normal samples in the memory pool. An end-to-end learning framework is employed by MAPL to identify the abnormal regions directly from the input data, which optimizes the ef-ficiency and real-time performance of de-tection. By conducting extensive trials on the recently developed BHAD dataset (in-cluding MVTec AD [1], Visa [2], and MDPP [3]), MAPL achieves an average im-age-level AUROC score of 86.2%, demon-strating a 5.1% enhancement compared to the original MemSeg [4] model.

However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.</p></details> |  | None |

The contribution of the proposed research is towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection, data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs. Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage in terms of privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sched...</summary><p>Scheduled for presentation at an upcoming conference</p></details> | None |

CAD faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and segmentation of small anomalous regions. Existing CAD methods store image distributions or patch features to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but they fail to preserve pixel-level detailed features for accurate segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose ReplayCAD, a novel diffusion-driven generative replay framework that replay high-quality historical data, thus effectively preserving pixel-level detailed features. Specifically, we compress historical data by searching for a class semantic embedding in the conditional space of the pre-trained diffusion model, which can guide the model to replay data with fine-grained pixel details, thus improving the segmentation performance. However, relying solely on semantic features results in limited spatial diversity. Hence, we further use spatial features to guide data compression, achieving precise control of sample space, thereby generating more diverse data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation, with notable improvements in segmentation: 11.5% on VisA and 8.1% on MVTec.

We introduce the adaptive cosine estimator (ACE) detection statistic. PaDiM uses the Mahalanobis distance at inference, an unbounded metric. ACE instead uses the cosine similarity metric, providing bounded anomaly detection scores. The proposed method is evaluated across multiple SAR datasets, with performance metrics including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) at the image and pixel level, aiming for increased performance in anomaly detection and localization of SAR imagery.

This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Distributional Drift Detection in Medical Imaging with Sketching and Fine-Tuned Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08456v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributional drift detection is important in medical applications as it helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of models by identifying changes in the underlying data distribution that could affect the prediction results of machine learning models. However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift, for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Vision Transformer model to extract relevant features, using mammography as a case study, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50% increased to 99.1%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GDformer: Going Beyond Subsequence Isolation for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18196v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection of multivariate time series is a challenging task, given the requirements of deriving a compact detection criterion without accessing the anomaly points. The existing methods are mainly based on reconstruction error or association divergence, which are both confined to isolated subsequences with limited horizons, hardly promising unified series-level criterion. In this paper, we propose the Global Dictionary-enhanced Transformer (GDformer) with a renovated dictionary-based cross attention mechanism to cultivate the global representations shared by all normal points in the entire series. Accordingly, the cross-attention maps reflect the correlation weights between the point and global representations, which naturally leads to the representation-wise similarity-based detection criterion. To foster more compact detection boundary, prototypes are introduced to capture the distribution of normal point-global correlation weights. GDformer consistently achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection performance on five real-world benchmark datasets. Further experiments validate the global dictionary has great transferability among various datasets.

| **[Examining the Source of Defects from a Mechanical Perspective for 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05901v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we go beyond identifying anomalies only in structural terms and think about better anomaly detection motivated by anomaly causes. Most anomalies are regarded as the result of unpredictable defective forces from internal and external sources, and their opposite forces are sought to correct the anomalies. We introduced a Mechanics Complementary framework for 3D anomaly detection (MC4AD) to generate internal and external Corrective forces for each point. A Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module is first proposed to simulate various anomalies. Then, we present a Corrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net) with complementary representations for point-level representation to simulate the different contributions of internal and external corrective forces. A combined loss was proposed, including a new symmetric loss and an overall loss, to constrain the corrective forces properly. As a highlight, we consider 3D anomaly detection in industry more comprehensively, creating a hierarchical quality control strategy based on a three-way decision and contributing a dataset named Anomaly-IntraVariance with intraclass variance to evaluate the model. On the proposed and existing five datasets, we obtained nine state-of-the-art performers with the minimum parameters and the fastest inference speed.

| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Robots via Mahalanobis SVDD with Audio-IMU Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05811v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable anomaly detection is essential for ensuring the safety of autonomous robots, particularly when conventional detection systems based on vision or LiDAR become unreliable in adverse or unpredictable conditions. In such scenarios, alternative sensing modalities are needed to provide timely and robust feedback. To this end, we explore the use of audio and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to detect underlying anomalies in autonomous mobile robots, such as collisions and internal mechanical faults. Furthermore, to address the challenge of limited labeled anomaly data, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on Mahalanobis Support Vector Data Description (M-SVDD). In contrast to conventional SVDD methods that rely on Euclidean distance and assume isotropic feature distributions, our approach employs the Mahalanobis distance to adaptively scale feature dimensions and capture inter-feature correlations, enabling more expressive decision boundaries. In addition, a reconstruction-based auxiliary branch is introduced to preserve feature diversity and prevent representation collapse, further enhancing the robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on a collected mobile robot dataset and four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as shown in the video https://youtu.be/yh1tn6DDD4A.

| **[Enhanced semi-supervised stamping process monitoring with physically-informed feature extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21389v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In tackling frequent batch anomalies in high-speed stamping processes, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised in-process anomaly monitoring framework, utilizing accelerometer signals and physics information, to capture the process anomaly effectively. The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A real-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed to illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with enhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Weighted Image-Event Multimodal Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02393v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing video anomaly detectors rely solely on RGB frames, which lack the temporal resolution needed to capture abrupt or transient motion cues, key indicators of anomalous events. To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors.

| **[Search is All You Need for Few-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11895v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) has emerged as a crucial yet challenging task in industrial inspection, where normal distribution modeling must be accomplished with only a few normal images. While existing approaches typically employ multi-modal foundation models combining language and vision modalities for prompt-guided anomaly detection, these methods often demand sophisticated prompt engineering and extensive manual tuning. In this paper, we demonstrate that a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass state-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD scenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential components: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and discriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support augmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to address the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature integration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency local details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual memory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection. Extensive evaluations across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD benchmarks demonstrate VisionAD's exceptional performance. Using only 1 normal images as support, our method achieves remarkable image-level AUROC scores of 97.4%, 94.8%, and 70.8% respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins (+1.6%, +3.2%, and +1.4%). The training-free nature and superior few-shot capabilities of VisionAD make it particularly appealing for real-world applications where samples are scarce or expensive to obtain.

| **[KPI Poisoning: An Attack in Open RAN Near Real-Time Control Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05537v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) is a new paradigm to provide fundamental features for supporting next-generation mobile networks. Disaggregation, virtualisation, closed-loop data-driven control, and open interfaces bring flexibility and interoperability to the network deployment. However, these features also create a new surface for security threats. In this paper, we introduce Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) poisoning attack in Near Real-Time control loops as a new form of threat that can have significant effects on the Open RAN functionality. This threat can arise from traffic spoofing on the E2 interface or compromised E2 nodes. The role of KPIs is explored in the use cases of Near Real-Time control loops. Then, the potential impacts of the attack are analysed. An ML-based approach is proposed to detect poisoned KPI values before using them in control loops. Emulations are conducted to generate KPI reports and inject anomalies into the values. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model is used to detect anomalies. The results show that more amplified injected values are more accessible to detect, and using more report sequences leads to better performance in anomaly detection, with detection rates improving from 62% to 99%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE FNWF 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference. These results offer valuable insights for detecting ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE Sensors Journal</p></details> | None |
