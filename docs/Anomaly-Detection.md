| **[Generating healthy counterfactuals with denoising diffusion bridge models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13684v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart. More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) - which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Adversarial Robustness and Uncertainty Quantification in DINOv2-based Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13643v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Contrastive Learning-Based Dependency Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13368v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space. Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC, while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong adaptability and stability in complex environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Isolation-based Spherical Ensemble Representations for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13311v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring. Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information: smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance over 11 baseline methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CleverCatch: A Knowledge-Guided Weak Supervision Model for Fraud Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13205v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of 1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency, offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare fraud detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Text Anomaly Detection with Simplified Isolation Kernel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13197v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at https://github.com/charles-cao/SIK.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/charles-cao/SIK) |
| **[IterMask3D: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Segmentation with Test-Time Iterative Mask Refinement in 3D Brain MR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04911v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation methods train a model to learn the training distribution as `normal'. In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as `anomalies'. To learn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods corrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned `normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose $\rm{IterMask3D}$, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks `normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of `normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

| **[Simulation-Based Pretraining and Domain Adaptation for Astronomical Time Series with Minimal Labeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12958v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

| **[CrossAD: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Cross-scale Associations and Cross-window Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12489v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies. Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the thirty-ninth annual conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> | None |
| **[Attack-Specialized Deep Learning with Ensemble Fusion for Network Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12455v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing scale and sophistication of cyberattacks pose critical challenges to network security, particularly in detecting diverse intrusion types within imbalanced datasets. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to maintain high accuracy across both frequent and rare attacks, leading to increased false negatives for minority classes. To address this, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates specialized deep learning models with an ensemble meta-classifier. Each model is trained to detect a specific attack category, enabling tailored learning of class-specific patterns, while their collective outputs are fused by a Random Forest meta-classifier to improve overall decision reliability. The framework is evaluated on the NSL-KDD benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in handling class imbalance compared to conventional monolithic models. Results show significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score across all attack categories, including rare classes such as User to Root (U2R). The proposed system achieves near-perfect detection rates with minimal false alarms, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. This work advances the design of intrusion detection systems by combining specialization with ensemble learning, providing an effective and scalable solution for safeguarding modern networks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Planted clique recovery in random geometric graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12365v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of identifying planted cliques in random geometric graphs, focusing on two distinct algorithmic approaches: the first based on vertex degrees (VD) and the other on common neighbors (CN). We analyze the performance of these methods under varying regimes of key parameters, namely the average degree of the graph and the size of the planted clique. We demonstrate that exact recovery is achieved with high probability as the graph size increases, in a specific set of parameters. Notably, our results reveal that the CN-algorithm significantly outperforms the VD-algorithm. In particular, in the connectivity regime, tiny planted cliques (even edges) are correctly identified by the CN-algorithm, yielding a significant impact on anomaly detection. Finally, our results are confirmed by a series of numerical experiments, showing that the devised algorithms are effective in practice.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Levarging Learning Bias for Noisy Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07441v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies. Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2) feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset. Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data.

| **[BeSTAD: Behavior-Aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12076v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts and deviations from established routines but also the identification of individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by The 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection</p></details> | None |
| **[Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11827v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness on Inland Waterways: A YOLO-Based Fusion of Satellite and AIS for Vessel Characterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11449v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550 instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification (tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1 score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1 score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded 93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets, incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further enhance operational scalability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DiffStyleTS: Diffusion Model for Style Transfer in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11335v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another. It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation, helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that disentangles a time series into content and style representations via convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TraceAegis: Securing LLM-Based Agents via Hierarchical and Behavioral Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11203v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have demonstrated promising adaptability in real-world applications. However, these agents remain vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, such as tool poisoning and malicious instructions, that compromise their execution flow and can lead to serious consequences like data breaches and financial loss. Existing studies typically attempt to mitigate such anomalies by predefining specific rules and enforcing them at runtime to enhance safety. Yet, designing comprehensive rules is difficult, requiring extensive manual effort and still leaving gaps that result in false negatives. As agent systems evolve into complex software systems, we take inspiration from software system security and propose TraceAegis, a provenance-based analysis framework that leverages agent execution traces to detect potential anomalies. In particular, TraceAegis constructs a hierarchical structure to abstract stable execution units that characterize normal agent behaviors. These units are then summarized into constrained behavioral rules that specify the conditions necessary to complete a task. By validating execution traces against both hierarchical and behavioral constraints, TraceAegis is able to effectively detect abnormal behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of TraceAegis, we introduce TraceAegis-Bench, a dataset covering two representative scenarios: healthcare and corporate procurement. Each scenario includes 1,300 benign behaviors and 300 abnormal behaviors, where the anomalies either violate the agent's execution order or break the semantic consistency of its execution sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that TraceAegis achieves strong performance on TraceAegis-Bench, successfully identifying the majority of abnormal behaviors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comprehensive Forecasting-Based Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection: Benchmarking on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11141v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures, yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods (Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE, PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7 categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688, ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1: 0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance: differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Causal Disentanglement Learning for Accurate Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11084v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the root causes of anomalies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 Figures, | None |
| **[Enhancing Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection: CLIP-SAM Collaboration with Cascaded Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11028v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks. However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP metrics, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by PRCV | None |

Reconstruction-based methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE. LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Deep Learning in Astrophysics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10713v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. - Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics for Volume 64.

| **[On the Problem of Consistent Anomalies in Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10456v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data. Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies -- similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.'' CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation, yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR (10/2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[A Representation Learning Approach to Feature Drift Detection in Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10325v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI is foreseen to be a centerpiece in next generation wireless networks enabling enabling ubiquitous communication as well as new services. However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Semantic Visual Anomaly Detection and Reasoning in AI-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10231v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies}, including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity assessment. In this paper, we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC images and introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}. Annotations are produced by a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality. At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We further show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric (\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}). Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary, AnomReason and AnomAgent serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and interpretable AIGC forensics.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures | None |

Existing eBPF-based monitors provide low-overhead system and network visibility but are limited to single clusters, while centralized approaches incur bandwidth, privacy, and heterogeneity challenges. We propose FedMon, a federated eBPF framework that unifies kernel-level telemetry with federated learning (FL) for cross-cluster anomaly detection. Lightweight eBPF agents capture syscalls and network events, extract local statistical and sequence features, and share only model updates with a global server. A hybrid detection engine combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Isolation Forests enables both temporal pattern modeling and outlier detection. Deployed across three Kubernetes clusters, FedMon achieves 94% precision, 91% recall, and an F1-score of 0.92, while cutting bandwidth usage by 60% relative to centralized baselines. Results demonstrate that FedMon enhances accuracy, scalability, and privacy, providing an effective defense for large-scale, multi-tenant cloud-native environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages , 6 figures , 1 table and it is a conference paper</p></details> | None |
| **[An Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection Approach for Efficient Online Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09977v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE 21st International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> | None |

They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 ICML Workshop on Machine Learning for Astrophysics, Code available at: https://github.com/StevenDillmann/ml-xraytransients-mnras</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/StevenDillmann/ml-xraytransients-mnras) |
| **[Wavelet Scattering Transform and Fourier Representation for Offline Detection of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09674v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection, WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.</p></details> | Paper Under Review | None |
| **[Rethinking Medical Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI: An Image Quality Assessment Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08228v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those leveraging autoencoders, have been widely adopted for anomaly detection task in brain MRI. Unlike most existing works try to improve the task accuracy through architectural or algorithmic innovations, we tackle this task from image quality assessment (IQA) perspective, an under-explored direction in the field. Due to the limitations of conventional metrics such as l1 in capturing the nuanced differences in reconstructed images for medical anomaly detection, we propose fusion quality, a novel metric that wisely integrates the structure-level sensitivity of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) with the pixel-level precision of l1. The metric offers a more comprehensive assessment of reconstruction quality, considering intensity (subtractive property of l1 and divisive property of SSIM), contrast, and structural similarity. Furthermore, the proposed metric makes subtle regional variations more impactful in the final assessment. Thus, considering the inherent divisive properties of SSIM, we design an average intensity ratio (AIR)-based data transformation that amplifies the divisive discrepancies between normal and abnormal regions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection. By fusing the aforementioned two components, we devise the IQA approach. Experimental results on two distinct brain MRI datasets show that our IQA approach significantly enhances medical anomaly detection performance when integrated with state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BIBM 2025. 6 pages, 4 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[On Uniformly Scaling Flows: A Density-Aligned Approach to Deep One-Class Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09452v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches. Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures. Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Information Sciences journal</p></details> | None |

Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

| **[TriP-LLM: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00047v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a triple-branch design comprising Patching, Selecting, and Global modules, to encode the input time-series into patch-wise representations, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments.

Spoofing, one of the most covert and deceptive TBM strategies, exhibits complex anomaly patterns across multilevel prices, while often being simplified as a single-level manipulation. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation architecture with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel manipulation and the contributions of key components for detection, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex time series data.</p></details> |  | None |

Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection (CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from 0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points, combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper.

To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point, respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image datasets collected from our implantation system.</p></details> | Accept by IROS 2025 | None |

Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025), Vienna, Austria</p></details> | None |

Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based \textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD} reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD) for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million parameters.

In this paper, we propose for the first time the use of Transformer neural networks, with a Masked Auto-Encoder architecture, as Foundation Models for SHM. We demonstrate the ability of these models to learn generalizable representations from multiple large datasets through self-supervised pre-training, which, coupled with task-specific fine-tuning, allows them to outperform state-of-the-art traditional methods on diverse tasks, including Anomaly Detection (AD) and Traffic Load Estimation (TLE). We then extensively explore model size versus accuracy trade-offs and experiment with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to improve the performance of smaller Transformers, enabling their embedding directly into the SHM edge nodes. We showcase the effectiveness of our foundation models using data from three operational viaducts. For AD, we achieve a near-perfect 99.9% accuracy with a monitoring time span of just 15 windows. In contrast, a state-of-the-art method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) obtains its first good result (95.03% accuracy), only considering 120 windows. On two different TLE tasks, our models obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation metrics (R$^2$ score, MAE% and MSE%). On the first benchmark, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.97 and 0.90 for light and heavy vehicle traffic, respectively, while the best previous approach (a Random Forest) stops at 0.91 and 0.84.

While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection, quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv) strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments, ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly synthesis</p></details> |  | None |

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ARRML2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LogAction: Consistent Cross-system Anomaly Detection through Logs via Active Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03288v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log-based anomaly detection is a essential task for ensuring the reliability and performance of software systems. However, the performance of existing anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01% F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art methods by 26.28%.

| **[LLM meets ML: Data-efficient Anomaly Detection on Unstable Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07467v4)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most log-based anomaly detectors assume logs are stable, though logs are often unstable due to software or environmental changes. Anomaly detection on unstable logs (ULAD) is therefore a more realistic, yet under-investigated challenge. Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for \task, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points (pp) in F1 score while using much less labeled data (62.87 pp reduction). When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 pp increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications, except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM) 2025</p></details> | None |

This study addresses these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark, we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism, trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing practical onboard anomaly detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint presented at the 15th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)</p></details> | None |
| **[MLLM4TS: Leveraging Vision and Multimodal Language Models for General Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07513v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g., classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting). These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Vacuum Spiker: A Spiking Neural Network-Based Model for Efficient Anomaly Detection in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06910v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals, assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 16 figures, preprint submitted to a journal for review</p></details> | None |

This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. The system combines visual feature extraction with natural language processing to enable contextual image interpretation, incorporating coordinate verification mechanisms and probabilistic Gaussian modeling for anomaly distribution. Multi-layered visualization techniques generate detailed medical illustrations, overlay comparisons, and statistical representations to enhance clinical confidence, with location measurement achieving 80 pixels average deviation. Result processing utilizes precise prompt engineering and textual analysis to extract structured clinical information while maintaining interpretability. Experimental evaluations demonstrated high performance in anomaly detection across multiple modalities. The system features a user-friendly Gradio interface for clinical workflow integration and demonstrates zero-shot learning capabilities to reduce dependence on large datasets. This framework represents a significant advancement in automated diagnostic support and radiological workflow efficiency, though clinical validation and multi-center evaluation are necessary prior to widespread adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

However, most existing methods struggle to determine the optimal cluster number, handle high-dimensional streaming data, and rely heavily on manually engineered features due to their shallow structures. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel clustering framework, referred to as Dirichlet process-deep generative model-integrated incremental learning (DPGIIL), for online structural anomaly detection, which combines the advantages of deep generative models (DGMs) in representation learning and the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in identifying distinct patterns in observed data. Within the context of variational Bayesian inference, a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of DPGIIL, tighter than the evidence lower bound, is derived analytically, which enables the joint optimization of DGM and DPMM parameters, thereby allowing the DPMM to regularize the DGM's feature extraction process. Additionally, a greedy split-merge scheme-based coordinate ascent variational inference method is devised to accelerate the optimization. The summary statistics of the DPMM, along with the network parameters, are used to retain information about previous data for incremental learning. For online structural anomaly detection, DPGIIL can not only detect anomalies by dynamically assigning incoming data to new clusters but also indicate different structural states using distinct clusters, thereby providing additional information about the operating conditions of the monitored structure compared to traditional anomaly detectors. Three case studies demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method and show that it outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in both structural anomaly detection and clustering.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages,9 figures,7 tables, accepted by Advanced Engineering Informatics</p></details> | None |
| **[From Description to Detection: LLM based Extendable O-RAN Compliant Blind DoS Detection in 5G and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06530v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality and experience of mobile communication have significantly improved with the introduction of 5G, and these improvements are expected to continue beyond the 5G era. However, vulnerabilities in control-plane protocols, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS), pose significant security threats, such as Blind Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Despite the availability of existing anomaly detection methods that leverage rule-based systems or traditional machine learning methods, these methods have several limitations, including the need for extensive training data, predefined rules, and limited explainability. Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot mode with unordered data and short natural language attack descriptions within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture. We analyse robustness to prompt variation, demonstrate the practicality of automating the attack descriptions and show that detection quality relies on the semantic completeness of the description rather than its phrasing or length. We utilise an RRC/NAS dataset to evaluate the solution and provide an extensive comparison of open-source and proprietary LLM implementations to demonstrate superior performance in attack detection. We further validate the practicality of our framework within O-RAN's real-time constraints, illustrating its potential for detecting other Layer-3 attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TelecomTS: A Multi-Modal Observability Dataset for Time Series and Language Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06063v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated, highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt, noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale information for practical observability applications.</p></details> |  | None |

This work presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures: convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention (VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81 and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is provided.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures | None |

Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000 images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail logistics anomaly detection.

Existing CLIP-based methods attempt to activate the model's ZSAD potential via handcrafted or static learnable prompts. The former incur high engineering costs and limited semantic coverage, whereas the latter apply identical descriptions across diverse anomaly types, thus fail to adapt to complex variations. Furthermore, since CLIP is originally pretrained on large-scale classification tasks, its anomaly segmentation quality is highly sensitive to the exact wording of class names, severely constraining prompting strategies that depend on class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce ViP$^{2}$-CLIP. The key insight of ViP$^{2}$-CLIP is a Visual-Perception Prompting (ViP-Prompt) mechanism, which fuses global and multi-scale local visual context to adaptively generate fine-grained textual prompts, eliminating manual templates and class-name priors. This design enables our model to focus on precise abnormal regions, making it particularly valuable when category labels are ambiguous or privacy-constrained. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that ViP$^{2}$-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust cross-domain generalization.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome this limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts. Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones, including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are constrained. The code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  | None |

Achieving the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data, they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images, temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size, thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2) anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to understand and detect anomalies in time series data.

Malicious actors may inject false data in communication channels to manipulate the tele-operators driving commands to cause harm. Hence, protection of this communication is necessary for the safe operation of the target vehicle. However, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, protection merely is not enough and the detection of an attack is necessary. Moreover, UN R155 mandates that security incidents across vehicle fleets be detected and logged. Thus, cyber-physical threats of ToD are modeled with an attack-centric approach in this paper. Then, an attack model with false data injection (FDI) on steering control commands is created from real vehicle data. The risk of this attack model is assessed for a last-mile delivery (LMD) application. Finally, a physics-informed context-aware anomaly detection system (PCADS) is proposed to detect such false injection attacks, and preliminary experimental results are presented to validate the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, Accepted at IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

This issue is particularly critical in domains such as medical diagnosis and anomaly detection, where correct classification of minority classes is essential. Conventional methods often fail to deliver satisfactory performance when the imbalance ratio is extremely severe. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Kernel-density-Oriented Threshold Adjustment with Regional Optimization (KOTARO), which extends the framework of kernel density estimation (KDE) by adaptively adjusting decision boundaries according to local sample density. In KOTARO, the bandwidth of Gaussian basis functions is dynamically tuned based on the estimated density around each sample, thereby enhancing the classifier's ability to capture minority regions. We validated the effectiveness of KOTARO through experiments on both synthetic and real-world imbalanced datasets. The results demonstrated that KOTARO outperformed conventional methods, particularly under conditions of severe imbalance, highlighting its potential as a promising solution for a wide range of imbalanced classification problems</p></details> |  | None |

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for detecting anomalies in the ubiquitous time series data. Traditional approaches struggle with variable-length time series sequences and context-based anomalies. We propose Soft Prompt Enhanced Anomaly Recognition (SPEAR), a novel approach to leverage LLMs for anomaly detection with soft prompts and quantization. Our methodology involves quantizing and transforming the time series data into input embeddings and combining them with learnable soft prompt embeddings. These combined embeddings are then fed into a frozen LLM. The soft prompts are updated iteratively based on a cross-entropy loss, allowing the model to adapt to time series anomaly detection. The use of soft prompts helps adapt LLMs effectively to time series tasks, while quantization ensures optimal handling of sequences, as LLMs are designed to handle discrete sequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that soft prompts effectively increase LLMs' performance in downstream tasks regarding time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous and Trusted Computing (ATC 2025)</p></details> | None |

Ensuring high reliability and robust security in these systems is therefore critical. This requires addressing reliability-related events, such as sensor failures and subsystem malfunctions, as well as cybersecurity threats. This paper introduces a novel cyber-attack simulation infrastructure designed to enhance simulation environments for real-time systems. The proposed infrastructure integrates reliability-oriented events and sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, including those targeting single or multiple sensors. We present the SCART framework and dataset, addressing a central challenge in real-time systems: the lack of scalable testing environments to assess the impact of cyber-attacks on critical systems and evaluate the effectiveness of defensive mechanisms. This limitation arises from the inherent risks of executing attacks or inducing malfunctions in operational systems. By leveraging simulation-based capabilities, the framework generates training and testing data for data-driven approaches, such as machine learning, which are otherwise difficult to train or validate under live conditions. This development enables the exploration of innovative methodologies to strengthen the resilience of real-time systems against cyber-attacks. The comprehensive functionalities of the proposed infrastructure improve the accuracy and security of critical systems while fostering the creation of advanced algorithms. These advancements hold the potential to significantly enhance anomaly detection in real-time systems and fortify their defenses against cyber threats.

Due to time series data possessing seasonality, trends, noise, and evolving patterns (concept drift), it becomes very difficult to set a general notion of what constitutes normal behavior. Anomalies themselves could be varied, ranging from a single outlier to contextual or collective anomalies, and are normally very rare; hence, the dataset is largely imbalanced. Additional layers of complexities arise due to the problems of increased dimensionality of modern time series, real-time detection criteria, setting up appropriate detection thresholds, and arriving at results that are interpretable. To embrace these multifaceted challenges, very strong, flexible, and interpretable approaches are required. This paper presents THEMIS, a new framework for time series anomaly detection that exploits pretrained knowledge from foundation models. THEMIS extracts embeddings from the encoder of the Chronos time series foundation model and applies outlier detection techniques like Local Outlier Factor and Spectral Decomposition on the self-similarity matrix, to spot anomalies in the data. Our experiments show that this modular method achieves SOTA results on the MSL dataset and performs quite competitively on the SMAP and SWAT$^*$ datasets. Notably, THEMIS exceeds models trained specifically for anomaly detection, presenting hyperparameter robustness and interpretability by default.

| **[LLM as an Algorithmist: Enhancing Anomaly Detectors via Programmatic Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03904v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods for tabular data usually rely on some assumptions about anomaly patterns, leading to inconsistent performance in real-world scenarios. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable reasoning capabilities, their direct application to tabular AD is impeded by fundamental challenges, including difficulties in processing heterogeneous data and significant privacy risks. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-DAS, a novel framework that repositions the LLM from a ``data processor'' to an ``algorithmist''. Instead of being exposed to raw data, our framework leverages the LLM's ability to reason about algorithms. It analyzes a high-level description of a given detector to understand its intrinsic weaknesses and then generates detector-specific, data-agnostic Python code to synthesize ``hard-to-detect'' anomalies that exploit these vulnerabilities. This generated synthesis program, which is reusable across diverse datasets, is then instantiated to augment training data, systematically enhancing the detector's robustness by transforming the problem into a more discriminative two-class classification task. Extensive experiments on 36 TAD benchmarks show that LLM-DAS consistently boosts the performance of mainstream detectors. By bridging LLM reasoning with classic AD algorithms via programmatic synthesis, LLM-DAS offers a scalable, effective, and privacy-preserving approach to patching the logical blind spots of existing detectors.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive and Explainable AI Agents for Anomaly Detection in Critical IoT Infrastructure using LLM-Enhanced Contextual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03859v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that critical IoT systems function safely and smoothly depends a lot on finding anomalies quickly. As more complex systems, like smart healthcare, energy grids and industrial automation, appear, it is easier to see the shortcomings of older methods of detection. Monitoring failures usually happen in dynamic, high dimensional situations, especially when data is incomplete, messy or always evolving. Such limits point out the requirement for adaptive, intelligent systems that always improve and think. LLMs are now capable of significantly changing how context is understood and semantic inference is done across all types of data. This proposal suggests using an LLM supported contextual reasoning method along with XAI agents to improve how anomalies are found in significant IoT environments. To discover hidden patterns and notice inconsistencies in data streams, it uses attention methods, avoids dealing with details from every time step and uses memory buffers with meaning. Because no code AI stresses transparency and interpretability, people can check and accept the AI's decisions, helping ensure AI follows company policies. The two architectures are put together in a test that compares the results of the traditional model with those of the suggested LLM enhanced model. Important measures to check are the accuracy of detection, how much inaccurate information is included in the results, how clearly the findings can be read and how fast the system responds under different test situations. The metaheuristic is tested in simulations of real world smart grid and healthcare contexts to check its adaptability and reliability. From the study, we see that the new approach performs much better than most existing models in both accuracy and interpretation, so it could be a good fit for future anomaly detection tasks in IoT</p></details> | 22 pages | None |
| **[PointAD+: Learning Hierarchical Representations for Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03277v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI | None |
| **[Towards Generalizable Context-aware Anomaly Detection: A Large-scale Benchmark in Cloud Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01844v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in cloud environments remains both critical and challenging. Existing context-level benchmarks typically focus on either metrics or logs and often lack reliable annotation, while most detection methods emphasize point anomalies within a single modality, overlooking contextual signals and limiting real-world applicability. Constructing a benchmark for context anomalies that combines metrics and logs is inherently difficult: reproducing anomalous scenarios on real servers is often infeasible or potentially harmful, while generating synthetic data introduces the additional challenge of maintaining cross-modal consistency. We introduce CloudAnoBench, a large-scale benchmark for context anomalies in cloud environments, comprising 28 anomalous scenarios and 16 deceptive normal scenarios, with 1,252 labeled cases and roughly 200,000 log and metric entries. Compared with prior benchmarks, CloudAnoBench exhibits higher ambiguity and greater difficulty, on which both prior machine learning methods and vanilla LLM prompting perform poorly. To demonstrate its utility, we further propose CloudAnoAgent, an LLM-based agent enhanced by symbolic verification that integrates metrics and logs. This agent system achieves substantial improvements in both anomaly detection and scenario identification on CloudAnoBench, and shows strong generalization to existing datasets. Together, CloudAnoBench and CloudAnoAgent lay the groundwork for advancing context-aware anomaly detection in cloud systems.

| **[Reasoning-based Anomaly Detection Framework: A Real-time, Scalable, and Automated Approach to Anomaly Detection Across Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03486v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in large, distributed systems presents several challenges. The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs to be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for a careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second challenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage such a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely deployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to monitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and operations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need to be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third challenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in such settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real time) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous time-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a unified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly Detection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection on very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that automates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for each use case. Finally, it incorporates a post-detection capability that allows for faster triaging and root-cause determination. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RADF, powered by mSelect, surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly detection models in AUC performance for 5 out of 9 public benchmarking datasets. RADF achieved an AUC of over 0.85 for 7 out of 9 datasets, a distinction unmatched by any other state-of-the-art model.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Unified Unsupervised Anomaly Detection via Matching Cost Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03363v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based (pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models. Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample, mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD scenarios.

As software architectures become increasingly distributed and subject to change, it becomes a greater challenge to diagnose system issues effectively, often having to deal with fragmented observability and more difficult root cause analysis. This paper builds upon our previous work and introduces three design patterns that address key challenges in monitoring cloud-native applications. Distributed Tracing improves visibility into request flows across services, aiding in latency analysis and root cause detection, Application Metrics provides a structured approach to instrumenting applications with meaningful performance indicators, enabling real-time monitoring and anomaly detection, and Infrastructure Metrics focuses on monitoring the environment in which the system is operated, helping teams assess resource utilization, scalability, and operational health. These patterns are derived from industry practices and observability frameworks and aim to offer guidance for software practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the EuroPLoP 2025 proceedings</p></details> | None |
| **[A Novel Unified Lightweight Temporal-Spatial Transformer Approach for Intrusion Detection in Drone Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02711v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks. Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability, efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net, a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records, demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks.

| **[Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs): highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity, and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-grained Abnormality Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10289v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods show remarkable success in prompting large pre-trained vision-language models to detect anomalies in a target dataset without using any dataset-specific training or demonstration. However, these methods often focus on crafting/learning prompts that capture only coarse-grained semantics of abnormality, e.g., high-level semantics like "damaged", "imperfect", or "defective" objects. They therefore have limited capability in recognizing diverse abnormality details that deviate from these general abnormal patterns in various ways. To address this limitation, we propose FAPrompt, a novel framework designed to learn Fine-grained Abnormality Prompts for accurate ZSAD. To this end, a novel Compound Abnormality Prompt learning (CAP) module is introduced in FAPrompt to learn a set of complementary, decomposed abnormality prompts, where abnormality prompts are enforced to model diverse abnormal patterns derived from the same normality semantic. On the other hand, the fine-grained abnormality patterns can be different from one dataset to another. To enhance the cross-dataset generalization, another novel module, namely Data-dependent Abnormality Prior learning (DAP), is introduced in FAPrompt to learn a sample-wise abnormality prior from abnormal features of each test image to dynamically adapt the abnormality prompts to individual test images. Comprehensive experiments on 19 real-world datasets, covering both industrial defects and medical anomalies, demonstrate that FAPrompt substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image- and pixel-level ZSAD tasks.

Yet, real-world adoption remains limited due to persistent challenges such as scalability constraints, high computational demands, and complex privacy requirements. This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing blockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose optimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight cryptography, and decentralized identity management. Additionally, we explore the novel role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in smart contract generation, anomaly detection, and user interaction. Our findings offer a foundation for designing secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain-based E-Voting systems suitable for national-scale deployment. This work lays the groundwork for building an end-to-end blockchain E-Voting prototype enhanced by LLM-guided smart contract generation and validation, supported by a systematic framework and simulation-based analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

In Fifth Generation (5G) networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator; PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, journal paper</p></details> | None |

Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, video anomaly detection</p></details> | None |

However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and (2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Normality Calibration in Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02014v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components, anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.</p></details> | 17 pages | None |

Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures.

Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection.

Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings. Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> | None |

This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Energ...</summary><p>Energy Informatics.Academy Conference 2025 (EI.A 2025), 3-6 December 2025, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p></details> | None |
| **[TShape: Rescuing Machine Learning Models from Complex Shapelet Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00680v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is critical for maintaining the reliability of modern IT infrastructures, where complex anomalies frequently arise in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we present TShape, a novel framework designed to address the challenges in industrial time series anomaly detection. Existing methods often struggle to detect shapelet anomalies that manifest as complex shape deviations, which appear obvious to human experts but prove challenging for machine learning algorithms. TShape introduces a patch-wise dual attention mechanism with multi-scale convolution to model intricate sub-sequence variations by balancing local, fine-grained shape features with global contextual dependencies. Our extensive evaluation on five diverse benchmarks demonstrates that TShape outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving an average 10\% F1 score improvement in anomaly detection. Additionally, ablation studies and attention visualizations confirm the essential contributions of each component, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of TShape to complex shapelet shapes in time series data.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing anomaly detection methods focus mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies. Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improved Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Unsupervised Subspace Modeling in the Signed Cumulative Distribution Transform Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00148v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures. Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures | None |

Here we introduce an anomaly detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates, and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MissionHD: Hyperdimensional Refinement of Distribution-Deficient Reasoning Graphs for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training. Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average. On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices. Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures | None |

Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e., automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

DL-based AAD systems improve security by enabling real-time threat detection in SDN-IoT networks. However, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate input data or exploit model weaknesses, significantly degrading detection accuracy. Existing research lacks a systematic analysis of adversarial vulnerabilities specific to DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT environments. This SoK study introduces a structured adversarial threat model and a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks, categorising them into data, model, and hybrid-level threats. Unlike previous studies, we systematically evaluate white, black, and grey-box attack strategies across popular benchmark datasets. Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference causing the most significant drop. C&W and DeepFool achieve high evasion success rates. However, adversarial training enhances robustness, and its high computational overhead limits the real-time deployment of SDN-IoT applications. We propose adaptive countermeasures, including real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and explainable AI-driven security frameworks. By integrating structured threat models, this study offers a more comprehensive approach to attack categorisation, impact assessment, and defence evaluation than previous research. Our work highlights critical vulnerabilities in existing DL-based AAD models and provides practical recommendations for improving resilience, interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance DL-based AAD security in SDN-IoT networks, offering a systematic adversarial threat model and conceptual defence evaluation based on prior empirical studies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniSage: A Unified and Post-Analysis-Aware Sampling for Microservices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26336v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traces and logs are essential for observability and fault diagnosis in modern distributed systems. However, their ever-growing volume introduces substantial storage overhead and complicates troubleshooting. Existing approaches typically adopt a sample-before-analysis paradigm: even when guided by data heuristics, they inevitably discard failure-related information and hinder transparency in diagnosing system behavior. To address this, we introduce UniSage, the first unified framework to sample both traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware paradigm. Instead of discarding data upfront, UniSagefirst performs lightweight and multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) on the complete data stream. This process yields fine-grained, service-level diagnostic insights that guide a dual-pillar sampling strategy for handling both normal and anomalous scenarios: an analysis-guided sampler prioritizes data implicated by RCA, while an edge-case-based sampler ensures rare but critical behaviors are captured. Together, these pillars ensure comprehensive coverage of critical signals without excessive redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniSage significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. At a 2.5% sampling rate, it captures 56.5% of critical traces and 96.25% of relevant logs, while improving the accuracy (AC@1) of downstream root cause analysis by 42.45%. Furthermore, its efficient pipeline processes 10 minutes of telemetry data in under 5 seconds, demonstrating its practicality for production environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Anomaly detection for generic failure monitoring in robotic assembly, screwing and manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26308v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies. Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[UniMMAD: Unified Multi-Modal and Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via MoE-Driven Feature Decompression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25934v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover, reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage, multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact, general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE, which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities, and 66 classes.

Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce a novel convex SSLM formulation which has been demonstrated to revert to a convex quadratic programming problem for hyperparameter values of interest. Leveraging the convexity of our method, we derive numerous results that are unattainable with traditional nonconvex approaches. We conduct a thorough analysis of how hyperparameters influence the optimal solution, pointing out scenarios where optimal solutions can be trivially found and identifying instances of ill-posedness. Most notably, we establish connections between our method and traditional approaches, providing a clear determination of when the optimal solution is unique--a task unachievable with traditional nonconvex methods. We also derive the nu-property to elucidate the interactions between hyperparameters and the fractions of support vectors and margin errors in both positive and negative classes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the performance of existing anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01% F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art methods by 26.28%.

This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can be distinguished from each other.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures | None |

Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ScatterAD: Temporal-Topological Scattering Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24414v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection.

Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing fault diagnosis methods are built using a task-independent manner, which fails to bridge the gap between anomaly detection and root cause localization in terms of data form and diagnostic objectives, resulting in three major issues: 1) Diagnostic bias accumulates in the system; 2) System deployment relies on expensive monitoring data; 3) The collaborative relationship between diagnostic tasks is overlooked. Facing this problems, we propose a novel end-to-end log-based fault diagnosis method, Chimera, whose key idea is to achieve end-to-end fault diagnosis through bidirectional interaction and knowledge transfer between anomaly detection and root cause localization. Chimera is based on interactive multi-task learning, carefully designing interaction strategies between anomaly detection and root cause localization at the data, feature, and diagnostic result levels, thereby achieving both sub-tasks interactively within a unified end-to-end framework. Evaluation on two public datasets and one industrial dataset shows that Chimera outperforms existing methods in both anomaly detection and root cause localization, achieving improvements of over 2.92% - 5.00% and 19.01% - 37.09%, respectively. It has been successfully deployed in production, serving an industrial cloud platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 (Research Track)</p></details> | None |

However, existing deep learning-based methods represent a black box for service providers, making it impossible for providers to understand how these methods detect anomalies, thereby hindering trust and deployment in real production environments. To address this issue, this paper defines a trustworthiness metric, diagnostic faithfulness, for models to gain service providers' trust, based on surveys of SREs at a major cloud provider. We design two evaluation tasks: attention-based root cause localization and event perturbation. Empirical studies demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly in diagnostic faithfulness. Consequently, we propose FaithLog, a faithful log-based anomaly detection system, which achieves faithfulness through a carefully designed causality-guided attention mechanism and adversarial consistency learning. Evaluation results on two public datasets and one industrial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in diagnostic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2025 (NIER Track)</p></details> | None |

Yet public datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000 time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions (median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection, and sensor drift studies.

| **[ResAD++: Towards Class Agnostic Anomaly Detection via Residual Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23741v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD), where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features. In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at https://github.com/xcyao00/ResAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an extended version of our NeurIPS 2024 paper, ResAD. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.20047</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/xcyao00/ResAD) |

Classical units, including Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for resource constrained deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.</p></details> | under review | None |
| **[Variational Autoencoders-based Detection of Extremes in Plant Productivity in an Earth System Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03266v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate anomalies significantly impact terrestrial carbon cycle dynamics, necessitating robust methods for detecting and analyzing anomalous behavior in plant productivity. This study presents a novel application of variational autoencoders (VAE) for identifying extreme events in gross primary productivity (GPP) from Community Earth System Model version 2 simulations across four AR6 regions in the Continental United States. We compare VAE-based anomaly detection with traditional singular spectral analysis (SSA) methods across three time periods: 1850-80, 1950-80, and 2050-80 under the SSP585 scenario. The VAE architecture employs three dense layers and a latent space with an input sequence length of 12 months, trained on a normalized GPP time series to reconstruct the GPP and identifying anomalies based on reconstruction errors. Extreme events are defined using 5th percentile thresholds applied to both VAE and SSA anomalies. Results demonstrate strong regional agreement between VAE and SSA methods in spatial patterns of extreme event frequencies, despite VAE producing higher threshold values (179-756 GgC for VAE vs. 100-784 GgC for SSA across regions and periods). Both methods reveal increasing magnitudes and frequencies of negative carbon cycle extremes toward 2050-80, particularly in Western and Central North America. The VAE approach shows comparable performance to established SSA techniques, while offering computational advantages and enhanced capability for capturing non-linear temporal dependencies in carbon cycle variability. Unlike SSA, the VAE method does not require one to define the periodicity of the signals in the data; it discovers them from the data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Convolutional Set Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22889v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor, typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet (https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer) |

However, existing acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then, we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC 0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

By integrating AI-driven red teaming, automated penetration testing, and real-time anomaly detection, the research develops a framework for assessing and mitigating security risks in quantum networks. The findings demonstrate that AI can be effectively used to simulate adversarial attacks, probe weaknesses in cryptographic implementations, and refine security mechanisms through iterative feedback. The use of automated exploit simulations and protocol fuzzing provides a scalable means of identifying latent vulnerabilities, while adversarial machine learning techniques highlight novel attack surfaces within AI-enhanced cryptographic processes. This study offers a comprehensive methodology for strengthening quantum security and provides a foundation for integrating AI-driven cybersecurity practices into the evolving quantum landscape.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HyCoVAD: A Hybrid SSL-LLM Model for Complex Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22544v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Learnable Kernel Density Estimation for Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21285v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and generalization. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[Extracting Actionable Insights from Building Energy Data using Vision LLMs on Wavelet and 3D Recurrence Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21934v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Online Resource Allocation with Average Budget Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11425v5)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of online resource allocation with average budget constraints. At each time point the decision maker makes an irrevocable decision of whether to accept or reject a request before the next request arrives with the goal to maximize the cumulative rewards. In contrast to existing literature requiring the total resource consumption is below a certain level, we require the average resource consumption per accepted request does not exceed a given threshold. This problem can be casted as an online knapsack problem with exogenous random budget replenishment, and can find applications in various fields such as online anomaly detection, sequential advertising, and per-capita public service providers. We start with general arrival distributions and show that a simple policy achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such a regret growing rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over accept arrivals, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget safety buffers. It turns out that a little more safety can greatly enhance efficiency -- small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. From a practical perspective, we extend the policy to the scenario with continuous arrival distributions, time-dependent information structures, as well as unknown $T$. We conduct both synthetic experiments and empirical applications on a time series data of New York City taxi passengers to validate the performance of our proposed policies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21190v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.</p></details> | 24 pages | None |

To address these issues, we propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach addresses the critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.

This paper introduces DGSP-GCN (Dynamic Graph Similarity Prediction based on Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning-based framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with dynamic graph signal processing techniques to provide a unified solution for evaluating generative models and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks. DGSP-GCN assesses how well a generated network snapshot matches the expected temporal evolution, incorporating an attention mechanism to improve embedding quality and capture dynamic structural changes. The approach was tested on five real-world datasets: WikiMath, Chickenpox, PedalMe, MontevideoBus, and MetraLa. Results show that DGSP-GCN outperforms baseline methods, such as time series regression and random similarity assignment, achieving the lowest error rates (MSE of 0.0645, MAE of 0.1781, RMSE of 0.2507).

Effective anomaly detection is crucial for providing operators with a clear understanding of each node's availability, status, and potential problems, thereby ensuring smooth accelerator operation. Traditional and learning-based anomaly detection methods face significant limitations due to the sequential nature of these logs and the lack of a rich, node-specific text corpus. To address this, we propose an approach utilizing word embeddings to represent log entries and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the typical sequential patterns of these embeddings for individual nodes. Anomalies are identified by scoring individual log entries based on a probability ratio: this ratio compares the likelihood of the log sequence including the new entry against its likelihood without it, effectively measuring how well the new entry fits the established pattern. High scores indicate potential anomalies that deviate from the node's routine behavior. This method functions as a warning system, alerting operators to irregular log events that may signify underlying issues, thereby facilitating proactive intervention.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Improved Time Series Anomaly Detection by Applying Structural Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20184v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

For small datasets, a memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection.

However, their increasing adoption raises serious security concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs) exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.</p></details> |  | None |

We present Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems.

| **[Anomaly Detection in Complex Dynamical Systems: A Systematic Framework Using Embedding Theory and Physics-Inspired Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19307v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems is essential for ensuring reliability, safety, and efficiency in industrial and cyber-physical infrastructures. Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on two subsets (FD001, FD003) of the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan engine degradation. TDC-AE machtes LSTMs and outperforms Transformers while achieving a nearly 100x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025</p></details> | None |

To overcome this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, a 3D Anomaly Detection in Additive Manufacturing dataset, that is the first large-scale, industry-relevant dataset for RGB+3D surface defect detection in additive manufacturing. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 unique parts, captured with four industrial depth sensors, and includes 27,346 annotated defects across 12 categories along with 27,346 annotations of machine element features in 16 classes. 3D-ADAM is captured in a real industrial environment and as such reflects real production conditions, including variations in part placement, sensor positioning, lighting, and partial occlusion. Benchmarking state-of-the-art models demonstrates that 3D-ADAM presents substantial challenges beyond existing datasets. Validation through expert labelling surveys with industry partners further confirms its industrial relevance. By providing this benchmark, 3D-ADAM establishes a foundation for advancing robust 3D anomaly detection capable of meeting manufacturing demands.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HDM: Hybrid Diffusion Model for Unified Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19200v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image anomaly detection plays a vital role in applications such as industrial quality inspection and medical imaging, where it directly contributes to improving product quality and system reliability. However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is withdrawn owing to issues found in the experimental results</p></details> | None |

However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MOMEMTO: Patch-based Memory Gate Model in Time Series Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18751v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant improvement in anomaly detection performance.</p></details> | in French language | None |
| **[Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18386v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention. Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks. The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network. A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations. To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Single Image Is All You Need: Zero-Shot Anomaly Localization Without Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18354v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

| **[On Multi-entity, Multivariate Quickest Change Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18310v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Reputation Aggregation: A Robust Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Federated Learning in 5G and Edge Network Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18044v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments face severe security threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform label flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a novel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse adversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of clients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based geometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client based on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering of suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients, countering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine failures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+ records) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves robust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%, respectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach. This demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated learning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, such flexibility introduces new vulnerabilities, such as switch misreporting led load imbalance, which in turn make such immersive environment vulnerable to severe quality degradation. In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning (ML)-based network anomaly detection framework that identifies such stealthy misreporting by capturing temporal inconsistencies in switch-reported loads, and thereby counter potentially catastrophic quality degradation of hosted immersive application. The detection system combines unsupervised anomaly scoring with supervised classification to robustly distinguish malicious behavior. Data collected from a realistic testbed deployment under both benign and adversarial conditions is used to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show that the framework achieves high recall in detecting misreporting behavior, making it effective for early and reliable detection in SDN environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 7 Images, will appear in CNSM 2025</p></details> | None |

In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

This paradox becomes particularly acute in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), where missed chromosomal abnormalities carry profound clinical consequences yet regulatory frameworks mandate explainable AI systems. We introduce Medical Priority Fusion (MPF), a constrained multi-objective optimization framework that resolves this fundamental trade-off by systematically integrating Naive Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic through mathematically-principled weighted fusion under explicit medical constraints. Rigorous validation on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples characterized by extreme class imbalance (43.4:1 normal-to-abnormal ratio) employed stratified 5-fold cross-validation with comprehensive ablation studies and statistical hypothesis testing using McNemar's paired comparisons. MPF achieved simultaneous optimization of dual objectives: 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) with 80% interpretability score, significantly outperforming individual algorithms (McNemar's test, p < 0.001). The optimal fusion configuration achieved Grade A clinical deployment criteria with large effect size (d = 1.24), establishing the first clinically-deployable solution that maintains both diagnostic accuracy and decision transparency essential for prenatal care. This work demonstrates that medical-constrained algorithm fusion can resolve the interpretability-performance trade-off, providing a mathematical framework for developing high-stakes medical decision support systems that meet both clinical efficacy and explainability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 47 figures, publish to BIBM</p></details> | None |

These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent research has focused on how to extract the most informative features, contrasting older kNN-based methods that use only pretrained features. These recent methods are much more expensive to train however and could complicate real-life application. Careful study of related work with regards to transformation invariance leads to the idea that popular benchmarks require robustness to only minor translations. With this idea we then formulate LWinNN, a local window based approach that creates a middle ground between kNN based methods that have either complete or no translation invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this small change increases accuracy considerably, while simultaneously decreasing both train and test time. This teaches us two things: first, the gap between kNN-based approaches and more complex state-of-the-art methodology can still be narrowed by effective usage of the limited data available. Second, our assumption of requiring only limited translation invariance highlights potential areas of interest for future work and the need for more spatially diverse benchmarks, for which our method can hopefully serve as a new baseline.

Most existing methods assume that normal patterns remain stable over time; however, this assumption often fails in practice due to the phenomenon we refer to as normality distribution shift (NDS), where normal behaviors evolve over time. Ignoring NDS can lead models to misclassify shifted normal instances as anomalies, degrading detection performance. To tackle this issue, we propose WhENDS, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method that aligns normal edge embeddings across time by estimating distributional statistics and applying whitening transformations. Extensive experiments on four widely-used dynamic graph datasets show that WhENDS consistently outperforms nine strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results and underscoring the importance of addressing NDS in dynamic graph anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17235v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is pivotal for numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing TSAD techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (ACM WSDM 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Long-term Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17068v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term trajectory anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the diversity and complex spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data. Existing trajectory anomaly detection methods fail to simultaneously consider both the high-level intentions of agents as well as the low-level details of the agent's navigation when analysing an agent's trajectories. This limits their ability to capture the full diversity of normal trajectories. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised trajectory anomaly detection method named Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion model (IHiD), which detects anomalies through both high-level intent evaluation and low-level sub-trajectory analysis. Our approach leverages Inverse Q Learning as the high-level model to assess whether a selected subgoal aligns with an agent's intention based on predicted Q-values. Meanwhile, a diffusion model serves as the low-level model to generate sub-trajectories conditioned on subgoal information, with anomaly detection based on reconstruction error. By integrating both models, IHiD effectively utilises subgoal transition knowledge and is designed to capture the diverse distribution of normal trajectories. Our experiments show that the proposed method IHiD achieves up to 30.2% improvement in anomaly detection performance in terms of F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus built using newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual datasets. DCAD-2000 includes over 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of data, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of current data cleaning methods, which rely on manual heuristic thresholds, we propose reframing data cleaning as an anomaly detection task. This dynamic filtering approach significantly enhances data quality by identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. We evaluate the quality of DCAD-2000 on the FineTask benchmark, demonstrating substantial improvements in multilingual dataset quality and task performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets.

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, capturing the complex and dynamic behaviours of individual traders poses significant challenges. Traditional classification and anomaly detection methods often establish a fixed risk boundary, failing to account for this complexity and dynamism. To tackle this issue, we propose a profit-aware risk ranker (PA-RiskRanker) that reframes the problem of identifying risky traders as a ranking task using Learning-to-Rank (LETOR) algorithms. Our approach features a Profit-Aware binary cross entropy (PA-BCE) loss function and a transformer-based ranker enhanced with a self-cross-trader attention pipeline. These components effectively integrate profit and loss (P&L) considerations into the training process while capturing intra- and inter-trader relationships. Our research critically examines the limitations of existing deep learning-based LETOR algorithms in trading risk management, which often overlook the importance of P&L in financial scenarios. By prioritising P&L, our method improves risky trader identification, achieving an 8.4% increase in F1 score compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) ranking models like Rankformer. Additionally, it demonstrates a 10%-17% increase in average profit compared to all benchmark models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)</p></details> | None |

We employ and compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify anomalies in federal spending patterns. The research addresses the growing need for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental datasets, where traditional auditing methods may fall short. Our methodology involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality and efficiency.

Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs), BlockScan introduces a series of customized designs to effectively model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a novel modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized masked language modeling mechanism for pretraining the Transformer architecture, incorporating RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. Finally, we design a novel anomaly detection method based on the model outputs. We further provide theoretical analysis for the detection method of our system. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockScan's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockScan is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work sets a new benchmark for applying Transformer-based approaches in blockchain data analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Such data generation entails placing relevant objects of appropriate sizes each, at meaningful location in a scene canvas. There have been two classes of popular approaches to such generation: graphics based, and generative models-based. Optimization problems are known to lurk in the background for both these classes of approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practically useful manifestation of the classical Bin Packing problem in the context of generation of synthetic image data. We conjecture that the newly introduced problem, Resizable Anchored Region Packing(RARP) Problem, is NP-hard, and provide detailed arguments about our conjecture. As a first solution, we present a novel heuristic algorithm that is generic enough and therefore scales and packs arbitrary number of arbitrary-shaped regions at arbitrary locations, into an image canvas. The algorithm follows greedy approach to iteratively pack region pairs in a careful way, while obeying the optimization constraints. The algorithm is validated by an implementation that was used to generate a large-scale synthetic anomaly detection dataset, with highly varying degree of bin packing parameters per image sample i.e. RARP instance. Visual inspection of such data and checking of the correctness of each solution proves the effectiveness of our algorithm. With generative modeling being on rise in deep learning, and synthetic data generation poised to become mainstream, we expect that the newly introduced problem will be valued in the imaging scientific community.</p></details> |  | None |

Research on anomaly detection is constrained by the availability of datasets that capture complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical of production processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of their applicability in real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection Dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. Beyond benchmarking recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training strategy, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Experiments show that even a small amount of injected, weakly labeled real defects improves generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Overall, our findings indicate that model-free synthetic defects can provide a cold-start baseline, whereas a small number of injected real defects refine the decision boundary for previously unseen defect characteristics. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, Revised version submitted to the Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, the dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14911042</p></details> | None |

Leveraging complementary information from these different modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results.

Discovering informative representations of normal samples is crucial to detecting anomalies effectively. Recent self-supervised methods have successfully learned such representations by employing prior knowledge about anomalies to create synthetic outliers during training. However, we often do not know what to expect from unseen data in specialized real-world applications. In this work, we address this limitation with our new approach Con$_2$, which leverages prior knowledge about symmetries in normal samples to observe the data in different contexts. Con$_2$ consists of two parts: Context Contrasting clusters representations according to their context, while Content Alignment encourages the model to capture semantic information by aligning the positions of normal samples across clusters. The resulting representation space allows us to detect anomalies as outliers of the learned context clusters. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach in extensive experiments on specialized medical datasets, outperforming competitive baselines based on self-supervised learning and pretrained models and presenting competitive performance on natural imaging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bt0zdsnWYc</p></details> | None |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

However, recent studies have shown that these deep learning-based approaches are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Attackers can use adversarial samples to change the sequential characteristics of behavior sequences and mislead malware classifiers. In this paper, an adversarial robustness anomaly detection method based on the analysis of behavior units is proposed to overcome this problem. We extract related behaviors that usually perform a behavior intention as a behavior unit, which contains the representative semantic information of local behaviors and can be used to improve the robustness of behavior analysis. By learning the overall semantics of each behavior unit and the contextual relationships among behavior units based on a multilevel deep learning model, our approach can mitigate perturbation attacks that target local and large-scale behaviors. In addition, our approach can be applied to both low-level and high-level behavior logs (e.g., API and syscall logs). The experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the compared methods, which indicates that our approach has better performance against obfuscation attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution. The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired consistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens the resilience of cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  | None |

The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture.

To address these, we propose two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection. The first employs a structural similarity-based scoring approach that enables lightweight, real-time defect detection with unsupervised thresholding and can be further enhanced through limited supervised tuning. The second applies a feature distance-based strategy using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, designed to monitor distributional shifts and support supervisory oversight. Evaluations on a representative sterile packaging dataset confirm that both approaches outperform baselines under hardware-constrained, regulated conditions. Cross-domain testing on the MVTec-Zipper benchmark further demonstrates that the structural similarity-based method generalises effectively and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while the feature distance-based method is less transferable but provides complementary monitoring capabilities. These results highlight a dual-pathway inspection strategy: structural similarity for robust inline detection and feature distance for supervisory monitoring. By combining operational performance with interpretability and lifecycle monitoring, the proposed methods also align with emerging regulatory expectations for high-risk AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 14 tables</p></details> | None |

We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

A crucial element of these models is positional encoding, which allows transformers to capture the intrinsic sequential nature of time series data. This survey systematically examines existing techniques for positional encoding in transformer-based time series models. We investigate a variety of methods, including fixed, learnable, relative, and hybrid approaches, and evaluate their effectiveness in different time series classification tasks. Our findings indicate that data characteristics like sequence length, signal complexity, and dimensionality significantly influence method effectiveness. Advanced positional encoding methods exhibit performance gains in terms of prediction accuracy, however, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity. Furthermore, we outline key challenges and suggest potential research directions to enhance positional encoding strategies.

However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14956v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents, and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution over time.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures | None |

It employs an online data quality monitoring (DQM) system to promptly spot and diagnose particle data acquisition problems to avoid data quality loss. In this study, we present a semi-supervised spatio-temporal anomaly detection (AD) monitoring system for the physics particle reading channels of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS using three-dimensional digi-occupancy map data of the DQM. We propose the GraphSTAD system, which employs convolutional and graph neural networks to learn local spatial characteristics induced by particles traversing the detector and the global behavior owing to shared backend circuit connections and housing boxes of the channels, respectively. Recurrent neural networks capture the temporal evolution of the extracted spatial features. We validate the accuracy of the proposed AD system in capturing diverse channel fault types using the LHC collision data sets. The GraphSTAD system achieves production-level accuracy and is being integrated into the CMS core production system for real-time monitoring of the HCAL. We provide a quantitative performance comparison with alternative benchmark models to demonstrate the promising leverage of the presented system.

Data curation is a time-consuming process for a large volume of data, making it challenging and expensive to deploy data analytics platforms in new environments. Transfer learning (TL) mechanisms promise to mitigate data sparsity and model complexity by utilizing pre-trained models for a new task. Despite the triumph of TL in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, efforts on complex ST models for anomaly detection (AD) applications are limited. In this study, we present the potential of TL within the context of high-dimensional ST AD with a hybrid autoencoder architecture, incorporating convolutional, graph, and recurrent neural networks. Motivated by the need for improved model accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with limited training data on systems with thousands of sensors, this research investigates the transferability of models trained on different sections of the Hadron Calorimeter of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN. The key contributions of the study include exploring TL's potential and limitations within the context of encoder and decoder networks, revealing insights into model initialization and training configurations that enhance performance while substantially reducing trainable parameters and mitigating data contamination effects.

First, most detection models usually consider centralized detection. Thus, all sensor data have to be uploaded to the control center for analysis, leading to a heavy traffic load. However, industrial sensor networks have high requirements for reliable and real-time communication. The heavy traffic load may cause communication delays or packets lost by corruption. Second, there are complex spatial and temporal features in industrial sensor data. The full extraction of such features plays a key role in improving detection performance.To solve the limitations above, this paper develops a cloud-edge collaborative data anomaly detection approach for industrial sensor networks that mainly consists of a sensor data detection model deployed at individual edges and a sensor data analysis model deployed in the cloud. The former is implemented using Gaussian and Bayesian algorithms, which effectively filter the substantial volume of sensor data generated during the normal operation of the industrial sensor network, thereby reducing traffic load. It only uploads all the sensor data to the sensor data analysis model for further analysis when the network is in an anomalous state. The latter based on GCRL is developed by inserting Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) into Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can effectively extract the spatial and temporal features of the sensor data for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally, RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step analytical outputs. We have released the corresponding resources, including code and datasets.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[Self Identity Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks. We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection.

Consequently, ensuring the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream, producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling qualitative evaluation by domain experts.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Pattern Recognition (2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[AD-DINOv3: Enhancing DINOv3 for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Anomaly-Aware Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14084v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution. Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects, rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.</p></details> |  | None |

These advancements are pivotal for integrating intelligent, data-driven applications aimed at enhancing network reliability and operational autonomy through the introduction of cognitive capabilities, as exemplified by the emerging Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) standards. Despite its potential, the nascent nature of O-RAN technology presents challenges, primarily due to the absence of mature operational standards. This complicates the management of data and intelligent applications, particularly when integrating with traditional network management and operational support systems. Divergent vendor-specific design approaches further hinder migration and limit solution reusability. These challenges are compounded by a skills gap in telecommunications business-oriented engineering, which remains a key barrier to effective O-RAN deployment and intelligent application development. To address these challenges, Boldyn Networks developed a novel cloud-native data analytics platform, specifically designed to support scalable AI integration within O-RAN deployments. This platform underwent rigorous testing in real-world scenarios, and applied advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve operational efficiency and customer experience. Implementation involved adopting Development Operations (DevOps) practices, leveraging data lakehouse architectures tailored for AI applications, and employing sophisticated data engineering strategies.

Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings.

In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries.

Recent studies have incorporated graph learning techniques to extract detailed information from provenance graphs, enabling the detection of attacks with greater granularity. Nevertheless, existing studies have largely overlooked the continuous yet subtle temporal variations in the structure of provenance graphs, which may correspond to surreptitious perturbation anomalies in ongoing APT attacks. Therefore, we introduce TFLAG, an advanced anomaly detection framework that for the first time integrates the structural dynamic extraction capabilities of temporal graph model with the anomaly delineation abilities of deviation networks to pinpoint covert attack activities in provenance graphs. This self-supervised integration framework leverages the graph model to extract neighbor interaction data under continuous temporal changes from historical benign behaviors within provenance graphs, while simultaneously utilizing deviation networks to accurately distinguish authentic attack activities from false positive deviations due to unexpected subtle perturbations. The experimental results indicate that, through a comprehensive design that utilizes both attribute and temporal information, it can accurately identify the time windows associated with APT attack behaviors without prior knowledge (e.g., labeled data samples), demonstrating superior accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods in differentiating between attack events and system false positive events.</p></details> |  | None |

Current anomaly detection methods rely on correlation-based analysis, which cannot separate true causal relationships from spurious associations. This limitation results in high false alarm rates and poor root cause analysis. We propose a novel Causal Digital Twin (CDT) framework for cyber-physical security in medium-scale ICS. Our method combines causal inference theory with digital twin modeling. The framework enables three types of causal reasoning: association for pattern detection, intervention for understanding system responses, and counterfactual analysis for attack prevention planning. We evaluate our framework on three industrial datasets: SWaT, WADI, and HAI, with validation through physical constraint compliance (90.8\%) and synthetic ground truth testing (structural Hamming distance 0.13). Results show significant improvements over seven baseline methods. Our CDT achieves F1-scores are $0.944 \pm 0.014$ for SWaT, $0.902 \pm 0.021$ for WADI, and $0.923 \pm 0.018$ for HAI with statistical significance ($p < 0.0024$, Bonferroni corrected). The framework reduces false positives by \SI{74}{\percent} and achieves \SI{78.4}{\percent} root cause analysis accuracy compared to \SI{48.7}{\percent} for existing methods. Counterfactual analysis enables defense strategies that reduce attack success by \SI{73.2}{\percent}. The system keeps real-time performance with \SI{3.2}{ms} latency, which is suitable for industrial deployment, while providing interpretable explanations for operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 Pa...</summary><p>29 Pages, six figures, and 14 tables,</p></details> | None |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE '26 (The 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering)</p></details> | None |

In such settings, inference latency poses a critical security risk, as delays may provide exploitable opportunities for attackers.

In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing</p></details> | None |
