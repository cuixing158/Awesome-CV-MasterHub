| **[KAN-AD: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00278v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) underpins real-time monitoring in cloud services and web systems, allowing rapid identification of anomalies to prevent costly failures. Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.</p></details> | 11 pages, ICML 2025 | None |
| **[A Multi-Step Comparative Framework for Anomaly Detection in IoT Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16872v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced critical security challenges, underscoring the need for accurate anomaly detection. Although numerous studies have proposed machine learning (ML) methods for this purpose, limited research systematically examines how different preprocessing steps--normalization, transformation, and feature selection--interact with distinct model architectures. To address this gap, this paper presents a multi-step evaluation framework assessing the combined impact of preprocessing choices on three ML algorithms: RNN-LSTM, autoencoder neural networks (ANN), and Gradient Boosting (GBoosting). Experiments on the IoTID20 dataset shows that GBoosting consistently delivers superior accuracy across preprocessing configurations, while RNN-LSTM shows notable gains with z-score normalization and autoencoders excel in recall, making them well-suited for unsupervised scenarios. By offering a structured analysis of preprocessing decisions and their interplay with various ML techniques, the proposed framework provides actionable guidance to enhance anomaly detection performance in IoT environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in Battery Thermal Images Using Visual Question Answering with Prior Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16674v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batteries are essential for various applications, including electric vehicles and renewable energy storage, making safety and efficiency critical concerns. Anomaly detection in battery thermal images helps identify failures early, but traditional deep learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially for anomalies due to safety risks and high data collection costs. To overcome this, we explore zero-shot anomaly detection using Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, which leverage pretrained knowledge and textbased prompts to generalize across vision tasks. By incorporating prior knowledge of normal battery thermal behavior, we design prompts to detect anomalies without battery-specific training data. We evaluate three VQA models (ChatGPT-4o, LLaVa-13b, and BLIP-2) analyzing their robustness to prompt variations, repeated trials, and qualitative outputs. Despite the lack of finetuning on battery data, our approach demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models that are trained with the battery data. Our findings highlight the potential of VQA-based zero-shot learning for battery anomaly detection and suggest future directions for improving its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[SD-MAD: Sign-Driven Few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16659v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical anomaly detection (AD) is crucial for early clinical intervention, yet it faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality medical imaging data, caused by privacy concerns and data silos. Few-shot learning has emerged as a promising approach to alleviate these limitations by leveraging the large-scale prior knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs). Recent advancements in few-shot medical AD have treated normal and abnormal cases as a one-class classification problem, often overlooking the distinction among multiple anomaly categories. Thus, in this paper, we propose a framework tailored for few-shot medical anomaly detection in the scenario where the identification of multiple anomaly categories is required. To capture the detailed radiological signs of medical anomaly categories, our framework incorporates diverse textual descriptions for each category generated by a Large-Language model, under the assumption that different anomalies in medical images may share common radiological signs in each category. Specifically, we introduce SD-MAD, a two-stage Sign-Driven few-shot Multi-Anomaly Detection framework: (i) Radiological signs are aligned with anomaly categories by amplifying inter-anomaly discrepancy; (ii) Aligned signs are selected further to mitigate the effect of the under-fitting and uncertain-sample issue caused by limited medical data, employing an automatic sign selection strategy at inference. Moreover, we propose three protocols to comprehensively quantify the performance of multi-anomaly detection. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders and Traffic Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16650v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the recent increase in the number of connected devices, the need to promptly detect security issues is emerging. Moreover, the high number of communication flows creates the necessity of processing huge amounts of data. Furthermore, the connected devices are heterogeneous in nature, having different computational capacities. For this reason, in this work we propose an image-based representation of network traffic which allows to realize a compact summary of the current network conditions with 1-second time windows. The proposed representation highlights the presence of anomalies thus reducing the need for complex processing architectures. Finally, we present an unsupervised learning approach which effectively detects the presence of anomalies.

The solutions available today for spoofing detection either rely on additional communication systems, receivers, and antennas, or require mobile deployments. Detection systems working at the Physical (PHY) layer of the satellite communication link also require time-consuming and energy-hungry training processes on all satellites of the constellation, and rely on the availability of spoofed data, which are often challenging to collect. Moreover, none of such contributions investigate the feasibility of aerial spoofing attacks launched via drones operating at various altitudes. In this paper, we propose a new spoofing detection technique for LEO satellite constellation systems, applying anomaly detection on the received PHY signal via autoencoders. We validate our solution through an extensive measurement campaign involving the deployment of an actual spoofer (Software-Defined Radio) installed on a drone and injecting rogue IRIDIUM messages while flying at different altitudes with various movement patterns. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique can reliably detect LEO spoofing attacks launched at different altitudes, while state-of-the-art competing approaches simply fail. We also release the collected data as open source, fostering further research on satellite security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication by Elsevier Computer Networks</p></details> | None |
| **[Privacy-Aware Cyberterrorism Network Analysis using Graph Neural Networks and Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16371v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyberterrorism poses a formidable threat to digital infrastructures, with increasing reliance on encrypted, decentralized platforms that obscure threat actor activity. To address the challenge of analyzing such adversarial networks while preserving the privacy of distributed intelligence data, we propose a Privacy-Aware Federated Graph Neural Network (PA-FGNN) framework. PA-FGNN integrates graph attention networks, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption into a robust federated learning pipeline tailored for cyberterrorism network analysis. Each client trains locally on sensitive graph data and exchanges encrypted, noise-perturbed model updates with a central aggregator, which performs secure aggregation and broadcasts global updates. We implement anomaly detection for flagging high-risk nodes and incorporate defenses against gradient poisoning. Experimental evaluations on simulated dark web and cyber-intelligence graphs demonstrate that PA-FGNN achieves over 91\% classification accuracy, maintains resilience under 20\% adversarial client behavior, and incurs less than 18\% communication overhead. Our results highlight that privacy-preserving GNNs can support large-scale cyber threat detection without compromising on utility, privacy, or robustness.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Interpretable Anomaly Detection in Encrypted Traffic Using SHAP with Machine Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16261v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of encrypted communication protocols such as HTTPS and TLS has enhanced data privacy but also rendered traditional anomaly detection techniques less effective, as they often rely on inspecting unencrypted payloads. This study aims to develop an interpretable machine learning-based framework for anomaly detection in encrypted network traffic. This study proposes a model-agnostic framework that integrates multiple machine learning classifiers, with SHapley Additive exPlanations SHAP to ensure post-hoc model interpretability. The models are trained and evaluated on three benchmark encrypted traffic datasets. Performance is assessed using standard classification metrics, and SHAP is used to explain model predictions by attributing importance to individual input features. SHAP visualizations successfully revealed the most influential traffic features contributing to anomaly predictions, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of the models. Unlike conventional approaches that treat machine learning as a black box, this work combines robust classification techniques with explainability through SHAP, offering a novel interpretable anomaly detection system tailored for encrypted traffic environments. While the framework is generalizable, real-time deployment and performance under adversarial conditions require further investigation. Future work may explore adaptive models and real-time interpretability in operational network environments. This interpretable anomaly detection framework can be integrated into modern security operations for encrypted environments, allowing analysts not only to detect anomalies with high precision but also to understand why a model made a particular decision a crucial capability in compliance-driven and mission-critical settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MADCluster: Model-agnostic Anomaly Detection with Self-supervised Clustering Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16223v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[Unsupervised Log Anomaly Detection with Few Unique Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08951v3)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces a novel method for detecting anomalies within log data from control system nodes at the European XFEL accelerator. Effective anomaly detection is crucial for providing operators with a clear understanding of each node's availability, status, and potential problems, thereby ensuring smooth accelerator operation. Traditional and learning-based anomaly detection methods face significant limitations due to the sequential nature of these logs and the lack of a rich, node-specific text corpus. To address this, we propose an approach utilizing word embeddings to represent log entries and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the typical sequential patterns of these embeddings for individual nodes. Anomalies are identified by scoring individual log entries based on a probability ratio: this ratio compares the likelihood of the log sequence including the new entry against its likelihood without it, effectively measuring how well the new entry fits the established pattern. High scores indicate potential anomalies that deviate from the node's routine behavior. This method functions as a warning system, alerting operators to irregular log events that may signify underlying issues, thereby facilitating proactive intervention.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Flashback: Memory-Driven Zero-shot, Real-time Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15205v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) automatically identifies anomalous events from video, mitigating the need for human operators in large-scale surveillance deployments. However, three fundamental obstacles hinder real-world adoption: domain dependency and real-time constraints -- requiring near-instantaneous processing of incoming video. To this end, we propose Flashback, a zero-shot and real-time video anomaly detection paradigm. Inspired by the human cognitive mechanism of instantly judging anomalies and reasoning in current scenes based on past experience, Flashback operates in two stages: Recall and Respond. In the offline recall stage, an off-the-shelf LLM builds a pseudo-scene memory of both normal and anomalous captions without any reliance on real anomaly data. In the online respond stage, incoming video segments are embedded and matched against this memory via similarity search. By eliminating all LLM calls at inference time, Flashback delivers real-time VAD even on a consumer-grade GPU. On two large datasets from real-world surveillance scenarios, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, we achieve 87.3 AUC (+7.0 pp) and 75.1 AP (+13.1 pp), respectively, outperforming prior zero-shot VAD methods by large margins.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[TRACE: Time SeRies PArameter EffiCient FinE-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16991v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an efficient fine-tuning method for time series foundation models, termed TRACE: Time Series Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning. While pretrained time series foundation models are gaining popularity, they face the following challenges: (1) Unlike natural language tasks, time series data vary in frequency, channel numbers, historical/prediction lengths. For long-term forecasting tasks in particular, tailored fine-tuning can significantly enhance performance.(2) Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA remain applicable but require adaptation to temporal characteristics. To address these challenges, our TRACE framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Gated DSIC (Gated Dynamic Simulation Importance Calculation), an unbiased LoRA module importance selection mechanism that ensures conditional parameter consistency before and after masking. Experiments demonstrate that Gated DSIC outperforms common fine-tuning. (2) Reconstructed prediction heads for long-term forecasting tasks, which achieve comparable or superior performance to linear probing heads while drastically reducing parameter counts. Extensive experiments on long-/short-term forecasting, anomaly detection and natural language tasks across diverse datasets, coupled with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Anomaly Detection Based on Critical Paths for Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14967v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notoriously hard to understand and difficult to defend. Extracting representative paths (including the neuron activation values and the connections between neurons) from DNNs using software engineering approaches has recently shown to be a promising approach in interpreting the decision making process of blackbox DNNs, as the extracted paths are often effective in capturing essential features. With this in mind, this work investigates a novel approach that extracts critical paths from DNNs and subsequently applies the extracted paths for the anomaly detection task, based on the observation that outliers and adversarial inputs do not usually induce the same activation pattern on those paths as normal (in-distribution) inputs. In our approach, we first identify critical detection paths via genetic evolution and mutation. Since different paths in a DNN often capture different features for the same target class, we ensemble detection results from multiple paths by integrating random subspace sampling and a voting mechanism. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results suggest that our method not only outperforms them, but it is also suitable for the detection of a broad range of anomaly types with high accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages in ACM journal latex format</p></details> | None |
| **[Partition-wise Graph Filtering: A Unified Perspective Through the Lens of Graph Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14033v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering, which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 31st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2025 February Cycle</p></details> | None |

Logical anomalies may appear visually normal yet violate predefined constraints on object presence, arrangement, or quantity, depending on reasoning and explainability. We introduce LogicQA, a framework that enhances AD by providing industrial operators with explanations for logical anomalies. LogicQA compiles automatically generated questions into a checklist and collects responses to identify violations of logical constraints. LogicQA is training-free, annotation-free, and operates in a few-shot setting. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) Logical AD performance on public benchmarks, MVTec LOCO AD, with an AUROC of 87.6 percent and an F1-max of 87.0 percent along with the explanations of anomalies. Also, our approach has shown outstanding performance on semiconductor SEM corporate data, further validating its effectiveness in industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Industry Track at ACL 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Multimodal RAG-driven Anomaly Detection and Classification in Laser Powder Bed Fusion using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13828v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of complex designs while minimizing waste, but faces challenges related to defects and process anomalies. This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by 12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information. The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASME ...</summary><p>ASME 2025 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference IDETC/CIE2025, August 17-20, 2025, Anaheim, CA (IDETC2025-168615)</p></details> | None |

We believe that unsupervised techniques are the best choice for our purposes because the data used to train the detector does not need to be manually labeled, and instead, the machine is intended to detect by itself the anomalies in the dataset, which liberates the user of tedious, time-consuming initial image examination. The structure must, additionally, provide the user with some measure of uncertainty in the detection, so the user can take decisions based on this measure.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[View-Invariant Pixelwise Anomaly Detection in Multi-object Scenes with Adaptive View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18012v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The built environment, encompassing critical infrastructure such as bridges and buildings, requires diligent monitoring of unexpected anomalies or deviations from a normal state in captured imagery. Anomaly detection methods could aid in automating this task; however, deploying anomaly detection effectively in such environments presents significant challenges that have not been evaluated before. These challenges include camera viewpoints that vary, the presence of multiple objects within a scene, and the absence of labeled anomaly data for training. To address these comprehensively, we introduce and formalize Scene Anomaly Detection (Scene AD) as the task of unsupervised, pixel-wise anomaly localization under these specific real-world conditions. Evaluating progress in Scene AD required the development of ToyCity, the first multi-object, multi-view real-image dataset, for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our initial evaluations using ToyCity revealed that established anomaly detection baselines struggle to achieve robust pixel-level localization. To address this, two data augmentation strategies were created to generate additional synthetic images of non-anomalous regions to enhance generalizability. However, the addition of these synthetic images alone only provided minor improvements. Thus, OmniAD, a refinement of the Reverse Distillation methodology, was created to establish a stronger baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that OmniAD, when used with augmented views, yields a 64.33\% increase in pixel-wise \(F_1\) score over Reverse Distillation with no augmentation. Collectively, this work offers the Scene AD task definition, the ToyCity benchmark, the view synthesis augmentation approaches, and the OmniAD method.

While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages excluding appendix</p></details> | None |

A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13123v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion (optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five modality backbones at inference.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TSPulse: Dual Space Tiny Pre-Trained Models for Rapid Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13033v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters, making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Structure-based Anomaly Detection and Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12751v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data. MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation at Politecnico di Milano</p></details> | None |
| **[TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032v5)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions.

However, the diversity of data modalities and the increasing number of specialized AD libraries pose challenges for non-expert users who lack in-depth library-specific knowledge and advanced programming skills. To tackle this, we present AD-AGENT, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that turns natural-language instructions into fully executable AD pipelines. AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining, and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical applications in AD.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods like the Anomaly Transformer and DCdetector have progressed, but they face limitations such as sensitivity to short-term contexts and inefficiency in noisy, non-stationary environments. To overcome these issues, we introduce MAAT, an improved architecture that enhances association discrepancy modeling and reconstruction quality. MAAT features Sparse Attention, efficiently capturing long-range dependencies by focusing on relevant time steps, thereby reducing computational redundancy. Additionally, a Mamba-Selective State Space Model is incorporated into the reconstruction module, utilizing a skip connection and Gated Attention to improve anomaly localization and detection performance. Extensive experiments show that MAAT significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving better anomaly distinguishability and generalization across various time series applications, setting a new standard for unsupervised time series anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

The collection comprises six distinct datasets with over 34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled experimental conditions, capturing the multifaceted nature of screw driving processes in plastic components. Each dataset systematically investigates specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use (s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types (s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware specifications, process phases, and data acquisition methods. The hierarchical data model preserves the temporal and operational structure of screw driving processes, facilitating both exploratory analysis and the development of machine learning models. To maximize accessibility, we provide dual access pathways: raw data through Zenodo with a persistent DOI, and a purpose-built Python library (PyScrew) that offers consistent interfaces for data loading, preprocessing, and integration with common analysis workflows. These datasets serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology evaluation, and classification of specific error conditions. By addressing the scarcity of standardized, comprehensive datasets in industrial manufacturing, this collection enables reproducible research and fair comparison of analytical approaches in an area of growing importance for industrial automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

However, previous generative-based models have been limited by suboptimal reconstruction quality, hampering their overall performance. We introduce DiffusionAD, a novel anomaly detection pipeline comprising a reconstruction sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. A fundamental enhancement lies in our reformulation of the reconstruction process using a diffusion model into a noise-to-norm paradigm. Here, the anomalous region loses its distinctive features after being disturbed by Gaussian noise and is subsequently reconstructed into an anomaly-free one. Afterward, the segmentation sub-network predicts pixel-level anomaly scores based on the similarities and discrepancies between the input image and its anomaly-free reconstruction. Additionally, given the substantial decrease in inference speed due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models, we revisit the denoising process and introduce a rapid one-step denoising paradigm. This paradigm achieves hundreds of times acceleration while preserving comparable reconstruction quality. Furthermore, considering the diversity in the manifestation of anomalies, we propose a norm-guided paradigm to integrate the benefits of multiple noise scales, enhancing the fidelity of reconstructions. Comprehensive evaluations on four standard and challenging benchmarks reveal that DiffusionAD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches and achieves comparable inference speed, demonstrating the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed pipeline.

Such volumes can be considered as high-dimensional outliers that can be identified using statistical outlier detection techniques, which allows for controlling the false positive rate. Previous work has used dimension reduction and multivariate outlier detection techniques, including the use of robust minimum covariance determinant (MCD) distances. Under Gaussianity, the distribution of these robust distances can be approximated, and an upper quantile of that distribution can be used to identify outlying volumes. Unfortunately, the Gaussian assumption is unrealistic for fMRI data in this context. One way to address this is to transform the data to Normality. A limitation of existing robust methods for this purpose, such as robust Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations, is that they can deal with skew but not heavy or light tails. Here, we develop a novel robust method for transformation to central Normality based on the highly flexible sinh-arcsinh (SHASH) family of distributions. To avoid the influence of outliers, it is crucial to initialize the outlier labels with a high degree of sensitivity. For this purpose, we consider a commonplace robust z-score approach, and a modified isolation forest (iForest) approach, a popular technique for anomaly detection in machine learning. Through extensive simulation studies, we find that our proposed SHASH transformation initialized using iForest clearly outperforms benchmark methods in a variety of settings, including skewed and heavy tailed distributions, and light to heavy outlier contamination. We also apply the proposed techniques to several example datasets and find this combination to have consistently strong performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Are vision language models robust to uncertain inputs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11804v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness against uncertain and ambiguous inputs is a critical challenge for deep learning models. While recent advancements in large scale vision language models (VLMs, e.g. GPT4o) might suggest that increasing model and training dataset size would mitigate this issue, our empirical evaluation shows a more complicated picture. Testing models using two classic uncertainty quantification tasks, anomaly detection and classification under inherently ambiguous conditions, we find that newer and larger VLMs indeed exhibit improved robustness compared to earlier models, but still suffer from a tendency to strictly follow instructions, often causing them to hallucinate confident responses even when faced with unclear or anomalous inputs. Remarkably, for natural images such as ImageNet, this limitation can be overcome without pipeline modifications: simply prompting models to abstain from uncertain predictions enables significant reliability gains, achieving near-perfect robustness in several settings. However, for domain-specific tasks such as galaxy morphology classification, a lack of specialized knowledge prevents reliable uncertainty estimation. Finally, we propose a novel mechanism based on caption diversity to reveal a model's internal uncertainty, enabling practitioners to predict when models will successfully abstain without relying on labeled data.</p></details> |  | None |

Biological neural networks can actively forget history knowledge that conflicts with the learning of new experiences by regulating learning-triggered synaptic expansion and synaptic convergence. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Biologically-Inspired Continual Learning Generative Adversarial Network (CL-BioGAN) for augmenting continuous distribution fitting ability for cross-domain HAD task, where Continual Learning Bio-inspired Loss (CL-Bio Loss) and self-attention Generative Adversarial Network (BioGAN) are incorporated to realize forgetting history knowledge as well as involving replay strategy in the proposed BioGAN. Specifically, a novel Bio-Inspired Loss composed with an Active Forgetting Loss (AF Loss) and a CL loss is designed to realize parameters releasing and enhancing between new task and history tasks from a Bayesian perspective. Meanwhile, BioGAN loss with L2-Norm enhances self-attention (SA) to further balance the stability and flexibility for better fitting background distribution for open scenario HAD (OHAD) tasks. Experiment results underscore that the proposed CL-BioGAN can achieve more robust and satisfying accuracy for cross-domain HAD with fewer parameters and computation cost. This dual contribution not only elevates CL performance but also offers new insights into neural adaptation mechanisms in OHAD task.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CL-CaGAN: Capsule differential adversarial continuous learning for cross-domain hyperspectral anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11793v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) has attracted remarkable attention in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing fields, and most existing deep learning (DL)-based algorithms indicate dramatic potential for detecting anomaly samples through specific training process under current scenario. However, the limited prior information and the catastrophic forgetting problem indicate crucial challenges for existing DL structure in open scenarios cross-domain detection. In order to improve the detection performance, a novel continual learning-based capsule differential generative adversarial network (CL-CaGAN) is proposed to elevate the cross-scenario learning performance for facilitating the real application of DL-based structure in hyperspectral AD (HAD) task. First, a modified capsule structure with adversarial learning network is constructed to estimate the background distribution for surmounting the deficiency of prior information. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, clustering-based sample replay strategy and a designed extra self-distillation regularization are integrated for merging the history and future knowledge in continual AD task, while the discriminative learning ability from previous detection scenario to current scenario is retained by the elaborately designed structure with continual learning (CL) strategy. In addition, the differentiable enhancement is enforced to augment the generation performance of the training data. This further stabilizes the training process with better convergence and efficiently consolidates the reconstruction ability of background samples. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed CL-CaGAN, we conduct experiments on several real HSIs, and the results indicate that the proposed CL-CaGAN demonstrates higher detection performance and continuous learning capacity for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting under cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Conditionally Activated Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning with Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04055v5)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as model poisoning and backdoor attacks. However, existing defense mechanisms often fall short in real-world settings due to key limitations: they may rely on impractical assumptions, introduce distortions by modifying aggregation functions, or degrade model performance even in benign scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel anomaly detection method designed specifically for practical FL scenarios. Our approach employs a two-stage, conditionally activated detection mechanism: cross-round check first detects whether suspicious activity has occurred, and, if warranted, a cross-client check filters out malicious participants. This mechanism preserves utility while avoiding unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, to ensure the transparency and integrity of the defense mechanism, we incorporate zero-knowledge proofs, enabling clients to verify the detection without relying solely on the server's goodwill. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to bridge the gap between theoretical advances in FL security and the demands of real-world deployment. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and real-world edge devices demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods of failure detection are often difficult to cope with the scale and dynamics of modern cloud environments. In this study, we propose a novel AI framework based on Massive Language Model (LLM) for intelligent fault detection and self-healing mechanisms in cloud systems. The model combines existing machine learning fault detection algorithms with LLM's natural language understanding capabilities to process and parse system logs, error reports, and real-time data streams through semantic context. The method adopts a multi-level architecture, combined with supervised learning for fault classification and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, so that the system can predict potential failures before they occur and automatically trigger the self-healing mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed model is significantly better than the traditional fault detection system in terms of fault detection accuracy, system downtime reduction and recovery speed.</p></details> |  | None |

A major challenge in detecting anomalies from the operational data arises due to the imbalanced class distribution problem since the anomalies are supposed to be rare events. This paper evaluates a diverse array of Machine Learning (ML)-based anomaly detection algorithms through a comprehensive benchmark study. The paper contributes significantly by conducting an unbiased comparison of various anomaly detection algorithms, spanning classical ML, including various tree-based approaches to Deep Learning (DL) and outlier detection methods. The inclusion of 104 publicly available enhances the diversity of the study, allowing a more realistic evaluation of algorithm performance and emphasizing the importance of adaptability to real-world scenarios. The paper evaluates the general notion of DL as a universal solution, showing that, while powerful, it is not always the best fit for every scenario. The findings reveal that recently proposed tree-based evolutionary algorithms match DL methods and sometimes outperform them in many instances of univariate data where the size of the data is small and number of anomalies are less than 10%. Specifically, tree-based approaches successfully detect singleton anomalies in datasets where DL falls short. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a study on a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms using diverse data sets, with the objective of guiding researchers and practitioners in making informed algorithmic choices, has not been attempted earlier.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN. Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Although existing zero-shot defect segmentation and detection methods have shown effectiveness, they cannot provide detailed descriptions of the defects. Furthermore, the application of large multi-modal models in IAD remains in its infancy, facing challenges in balancing question-answering (QA) performance and mask-based grounding capabilities, often owing to overfitting during the fine-tuning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that introduces a dedicated multi-modal defect localization module to decouple the dialog functionality from the core feature extraction. This decoupling is achieved through independent optimization objectives and tailored learning strategies. Additionally, we contribute to the first multi-modal industrial anomaly detection training dataset, named Defect Detection Question Answering (DDQA), encompassing a wide range of defect types and industrial scenarios. Unlike conventional datasets that rely on GPT-generated data, DDQA ensures authenticity and reliability and offers a robust foundation for model training. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Assistant (EIAD), achieves outstanding performance in defect detection and localization tasks. It not only significantly enhances accuracy but also improves interpretability. These advancements highlight the potential of EIAD for practical applications in industrial settings.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 | None |

The answer lies in the concept of Radon-Nikod\'ym theorem, a fundamental concept in measure theory. The key insight from this article is: Multiplying the vanilla loss function with the Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative improves the performance across the board. We refer to this as RN-Loss. We prove this using the setting of PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learnability. Depending on the context a Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes different forms. In the simplest case of supervised anomaly detection, Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes the form of a simple weighted loss. In the case of unsupervised anomaly detection (with distributional assumptions), Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes the form of the popular cluster based local outlier factor. We evaluate our algorithm on 96 datasets, including univariate and multivariate data from diverse domains, including healthcare, cybersecurity, and finance. We show that RN-Derivative algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods on 68% of Multivariate datasets (based on F1 scores) and also achieves peak F1-scores on 72% of time series (Univariate) datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

The novel framework consists of two components, a Stacked Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (SREnc-Dec) module that captures temporal features in a latent space, and a Multi-Receptive-field Wavelet Probabilistic Network (MRWPN) that creates an ensemble probabilistic model to characterise the latent space. This formulation extends the standard wavelet probabilistic networks to wavelet deep probabilistic networks, which can handle higher data dimensionality. The MRWPN module can adapt to different rates of data variation in different datasets without imposing strong distribution assumptions, resulting in a more robust and accurate detection for Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) tasks in the non-stationary environment. We carry out the assessment on 45 real-world time series datasets from various domains, verify the performance of RWPNN in TSAD tasks with several constraints, and show its ability to provide early warnings for anomalous events.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce Anomaly-Aware Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning (APF), a targeted and effective framework to mitigate the above challenges in GAD. In the pre-training stage, APF incorporates node-specific subgraphs selected via the Rayleigh Quotient, a label-free anomaly metric, into the learning objective to enhance anomaly awareness. It further introduces two learnable spectral polynomial filters to jointly learn dual representations that capture both general semantics and subtle anomaly cues. During fine-tuning, a gated fusion mechanism adaptively integrates pre-trained representations across nodes and dimensions, while an anomaly-aware regularization loss encourages abnormal nodes to preserve more anomaly-relevant information. Furthermore, we theoretically show that APF tends to achieve linear separability under mild conditions. Comprehensive experiments on 10 benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of APF in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

In these scenarios, possible bias from anomaly detection systems can lead to unfair treatment for different groups and even exacerbate social bias. In this work, first, we thoroughly analyze the feasibility and necessary assumptions for ensuring group fairness in unsupervised anomaly detection. Second, we propose a novel fairness-aware anomaly detection method FairAD. From the normal training data, FairAD learns a projection to map data of different demographic groups to a common target distribution that is simple and compact, and hence provides a reliable base to estimate the density of the data. The density can be directly used to identify anomalies while the common target distribution ensures fairness between different groups. Furthermore, we propose a threshold-free fairness metric that provides a global view for model's fairness, eliminating dependence on manual threshold selection. Experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an improved trade-off between detection accuracy and fairness under both balanced and skewed data across different groups.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these complexities, we propose ADALog, an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection framework designed for practical applicability across diverse real-world environments. Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict sequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual unstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs adaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a transformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language modeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic and semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are identified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into log-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only on normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system behaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in traditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird, and Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Additional ablation studies examine the effects of masking, fine-tuning, and token positioning on model behavior and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper accepted at ICMLT 2025; to appear in the IEEE Conference Proceedings</p></details> | None |

However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of the approaches in this relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This work systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods. We benchmark seven of them on public datasets and critically assess their comparability and the reproducibility of their reported results. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field, with insights on how to report results, which data sets, metrics and which terminology to use, and which inconsistencies to avoid, with code and results made publicly available for transparency.</p></details> | 36 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11641v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates, complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second, comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service, adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods. We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at https://github.com/gaobb/AdaptCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 15 figures, 22 tables</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/gaobb/AdaptCLIP) |

Existing methods for correlating mixing accounts suffer from limited labeled data and vulnerability to noisy annotations, which restrict their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose StealthLink, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through cross-task domain-invariant feature learning. Our key innovation lies in transferring knowledge from the well-studied domain of blockchain anomaly detection to the data-scarce task of mixing transaction tracing. Specifically, we design a MixFusion module that constructs and encodes mixing subgraphs to capture local transactional patterns, while introducing a knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns discriminative features across domains through adversarial discrepancy minimization. This dual approach enables robust feature learning under label scarcity and distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on real-world mixing transaction datasets demonstrate that StealthLink achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 96.98\% F1-score in 10-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our framework shows superior generalization capability in imbalanced data conditions than conventional supervised methods. This work establishes the first systematic approach for cross-domain knowledge transfer in blockchain forensics, providing a practical solution for combating privacy-enhanced financial crimes in decentralized ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Crypt...</summary><p>Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, mixing services, GNN</p></details> | None |

Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly. Our findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly integrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security systems for explainable threat detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Experimental validation on real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection techniques that undergo periodic retraining.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot, and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods.

However, these self-attention reconstruction models primarily operate on target features, which may result in perfect reconstruction for both normal and anomaly features due to high consistency with context, leading to failure in detecting anomalies. Additionally, these models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation. OneNIP outperforms previous methods on three industry anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec, BTAD, and VisA.

Some existing anomaly detection methods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external data. However, there is always a large semantic gap between synthetic and real-world anomalies, resulting in weak performance in anomaly detection. To solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen) method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec. The experiments demonstrate that our generated anomalies effectively improve the model performance of both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks simultaneously, \eg, DRAEM and DseTSeg achieved a 5.8\% and 1.5\% improvement in AU-PR metric on segmentation task, respectively.

Within anomaly detection, novelty detection focuses on identifying previously unseen patterns after training solely on regular data. While classic algorithms such as One-Class SVM or Local Outlier Factor (LOF) have been widely applied, they often lack interpretability and scalability. In this work, we explore the Half-Space Tree (HST) algorithm, originally proposed for streaming anomaly detection, and propose a novel theoretical modification to adapt it specifically for novelty detection tasks. Our approach is grounded in the idea that anomalies i.e., novelties tend to appear in the higher leaves of the tree, which are less frequently visited by regular instances. We analytically demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using probabilistic analysis, expected depth (EXD) calculations, and combinatorial reasoning. A comparative analysis of expected depths between our modified HST and the original Isolation Forest highlights that novelty points are significantly more isolated in our approach. This supports the hypothesis that HSTs, with appropriate structural adaptation, can serve as interpretable and efficient novelty detectors. The paper contributes a theoretical foundation and supporting analysis for this adaptation, setting the stage for further application and experimentation.</p></details> |  | None |

A major challenge with this task is the absence of structural-temporal coupling information, which decreases the ability of the representation to distinguish anomalies from normal instances. Existing methods focus on handling independent structural and temporal features with embedding models, which ignore the deep interaction between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a structural-temporal coupling anomaly detection architecture with a dynamic graph transformer model. Specifically, we introduce structural and temporal features from two integration levels to provide anomaly-aware graph evolutionary patterns. Then, a dynamic graph transformer enhanced by two-dimensional positional encoding is implemented to capture both discrimination and contextual consistency signals. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models. Finally, a case study illustrates the strength of our method when applied to a real-world task.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures | None |

Unlike traditional classifiers that rely on fixed thresholds or a single decision boundary, this approach defines an anomaly scoring function based on probability density using negative log-likelihood. This significantly enhances the model's ability to detect rare and unstructured behaviors. Experiments are conducted on the real-world network user dataset UNSW-NB15. A series of performance comparisons and stability validation experiments are designed. These cover multiple evaluation aspects, including Accuracy, F1- score, AUC, and loss fluctuation. The results show that the proposed method outperforms several advanced neural network architectures in both performance and training stability.

The autoencoder is trained on thermal images captured from a commercial power module at randomly varied load currents and augmented image2 generated through image processing techniques such as resizing, rotation, perspective transformation, and bright and contrast adjustment. Since the autoencoder is trained to output images identical to input only for normal samples, it reconstructs images similar to normal ones even when the input images containing faults. A small heater is attached to the circuit board to simulate a fault on a power module, and then thermal images were captured from different angles and positions, as well as various load currents to test the trained autoencoder model. The areas under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the autoencoder model can detect anomalies with 100% accuracy under given conditions.

Machine Learning-based IDS that learn from the network traffic characteristics and can discern attack patterns from benign traffic offer an advanced solution to traditional signature-based IDS. However, they heavily rely on labeled datasets, and their ability to generalize when encountering unseen traffic patterns remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised contrastive learning approach based on transformer encoders, specifically tailored for generalizable intrusion detection on raw packet sequences. Our proposed learning scheme employs a packet-level data augmentation strategy combined with a transformer-based architecture to extract and generate meaningful representations of traffic flows. Unlike traditional methods reliant on handcrafted statistical features (NetFlow), our approach automatically learns comprehensive packet sequence representations, significantly enhancing performance in anomaly identification tasks and supervised learning for intrusion detection. Our transformer-based framework exhibits better performance in comparison to existing NetFlow self-supervised methods. Specifically, we achieve up to a 3% higher AUC in anomaly detection for intra-dataset evaluation and up to 20% higher AUC scores in inter-dataset evaluation. Moreover, our model provides a strong baseline for supervised intrusion detection with limited labeled data, exhibiting an improvement over self-supervised NetFlow models of up to 1.5% AUC when pretrained and evaluated on the same dataset. Additionally, we show the adaptability of our pretrained model when fine-tuned across different datasets, demonstrating strong performance even when lacking benign data from the target domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IFIP Networking 2025.

The huge computation and storage costs caused by the increasing product classes limit the application of single-class unsupervised methods, necessitating the development of multi-class unsupervised methods. However, the feature similarity between normal and anomalous points from different class data leads to the feature confusion problem, which greatly hinders the performance of multi-class methods. Therefore, we introduce a multi-class point cloud anomaly detection method, named GLFM, leveraging global-local feature matching to progressively separate data that are prone to confusion across multiple classes. Specifically, GLFM is structured into three stages: Stage-I proposes an anomaly synthesis pipeline that stretches point clouds to create abundant anomaly data that are utilized to adapt the point cloud feature extractor for better feature representation. Stage-II establishes the global and local memory banks according to the global and local feature distributions of all the training data, weakening the impact of feature confusion on the establishment of the memory bank. Stage-III implements anomaly detection of test data leveraging its feature distance from global and local memory banks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD, Real3D-AD and actual industry parts dataset showcase our proposed GLFM's superior point cloud anomaly detection performance.

Research in the cross-modal medical image translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data, especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then, we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35 paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on 35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models. Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around 0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation, outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative image dataset are available.</p></details> |  | None |

Without any label, deep UOD methods struggle with the misalignment between the model's direct optimization goal and the final performance goal of Outlier Detection (OD) task. Through the perspective of training dynamics, this paper proposes an early stopping algorithm to optimize the training of deep UOD models, ensuring they perform optimally in OD rather than overfitting the entire contaminated dataset. Inspired by UOD mechanism and inlier priority phenomenon, where intuitively models fit inliers more quickly than outliers, we propose GradStop, a sampling-based label-free algorithm to estimate model's real-time performance during training. First, a sampling method generates two sets: one likely containing more outliers and the other more inliers, then a metric based on gradient cohesion is applied to probe into current training dynamics, which reflects model's performance on OD task. Experimental results on 4 deep UOD algorithms and 47 real-world datasets and theoretical proofs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed early stopping algorithm in enhancing the performance of deep UOD models. Auto Encoder (AE) enhanced by GradStop achieves better performance than itself, other SOTA UOD methods, and even ensemble AEs. Our method provides a robust and effective solution to the problem of performance degradation during training, enabling deep UOD models to achieve better potential in anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[MAPL: Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06198v3)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large unlabeled data and difficult-to-identify anomalies are the urgent issues need to overcome in most industrial scene. In order to address this issue, a new meth-odology for detecting surface defects in in-dustrial settings is introduced, referred to as Memory Augmentation and Pseudo-Labeling(MAPL). The methodology first in-troduces an anomaly simulation strategy, which significantly improves the model's ability to recognize rare or unknown anom-aly types by generating simulated anomaly samples. To cope with the problem of the lack of labeling of anomalous simulated samples, a pseudo-labeler method based on a one-classifier ensemble was employed in this study, which enhances the robustness of the model in the case of limited labeling data by automatically selecting key pseudo-labeling hyperparameters. Meanwhile, a memory-enhanced learning mechanism is introduced to effectively predict abnormal regions by analyzing the difference be-tween the input samples and the normal samples in the memory pool. An end-to-end learning framework is employed by MAPL to identify the abnormal regions directly from the input data, which optimizes the ef-ficiency and real-time performance of de-tection. By conducting extensive trials on the recently developed BHAD dataset (in-cluding MVTec AD [1], Visa [2], and MDPP [3]), MAPL achieves an average im-age-level AUROC score of 86.2%, demon-strating a 5.1% enhancement compared to the original MemSeg [4] model.

The contribution of the proposed research is towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection, data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs. Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage in terms of privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sched...</summary><p>Scheduled for presentation at an upcoming conference</p></details> | None |

CAD faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and segmentation of small anomalous regions. Existing CAD methods store image distributions or patch features to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but they fail to preserve pixel-level detailed features for accurate segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose ReplayCAD, a novel diffusion-driven generative replay framework that replay high-quality historical data, thus effectively preserving pixel-level detailed features. Specifically, we compress historical data by searching for a class semantic embedding in the conditional space of the pre-trained diffusion model, which can guide the model to replay data with fine-grained pixel details, thus improving the segmentation performance. However, relying solely on semantic features results in limited spatial diversity. Hence, we further use spatial features to guide data compression, achieving precise control of sample space, thereby generating more diverse data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation, with notable improvements in segmentation: 11.5% on VisA and 8.1% on MVTec.

This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift, for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Vision Transformer model to extract relevant features, using mammography as a case study, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50% increased to 99.1%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.</p></details> |  | None |

The existing methods are mainly based on reconstruction error or association divergence, which are both confined to isolated subsequences with limited horizons, hardly promising unified series-level criterion. In this paper, we propose the Global Dictionary-enhanced Transformer (GDformer) with a renovated dictionary-based cross attention mechanism to cultivate the global representations shared by all normal points in the entire series. Accordingly, the cross-attention maps reflect the correlation weights between the point and global representations, which naturally leads to the representation-wise similarity-based detection criterion. To foster more compact detection boundary, prototypes are introduced to capture the distribution of normal point-global correlation weights. GDformer consistently achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection performance on five real-world benchmark datasets. Further experiments validate the global dictionary has great transferability among various datasets.

Most anomalies are regarded as the result of unpredictable defective forces from internal and external sources, and their opposite forces are sought to correct the anomalies. We introduced a Mechanics Complementary framework for 3D anomaly detection (MC4AD) to generate internal and external Corrective forces for each point. A Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module is first proposed to simulate various anomalies. Then, we present a Corrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net) with complementary representations for point-level representation to simulate the different contributions of internal and external corrective forces. A combined loss was proposed, including a new symmetric loss and an overall loss, to constrain the corrective forces properly. As a highlight, we consider 3D anomaly detection in industry more comprehensively, creating a hierarchical quality control strategy based on a three-way decision and contributing a dataset named Anomaly-IntraVariance with intraclass variance to evaluate the model. On the proposed and existing five datasets, we obtained nine state-of-the-art performers with the minimum parameters and the fastest inference speed.

In such scenarios, alternative sensing modalities are needed to provide timely and robust feedback. To this end, we explore the use of audio and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to detect underlying anomalies in autonomous mobile robots, such as collisions and internal mechanical faults. Furthermore, to address the challenge of limited labeled anomaly data, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on Mahalanobis Support Vector Data Description (M-SVDD). In contrast to conventional SVDD methods that rely on Euclidean distance and assume isotropic feature distributions, our approach employs the Mahalanobis distance to adaptively scale feature dimensions and capture inter-feature correlations, enabling more expressive decision boundaries. In addition, a reconstruction-based auxiliary branch is introduced to preserve feature diversity and prevent representation collapse, further enhancing the robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on a collected mobile robot dataset and four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as shown in the video https://youtu.be/yh1tn6DDD4A.

The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A real-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed to illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with enhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |

Disaggregation, virtualisation, closed-loop data-driven control, and open interfaces bring flexibility and interoperability to the network deployment. However, these features also create a new surface for security threats. In this paper, we introduce Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) poisoning attack in Near Real-Time control loops as a new form of threat that can have significant effects on the Open RAN functionality. This threat can arise from traffic spoofing on the E2 interface or compromised E2 nodes. The role of KPIs is explored in the use cases of Near Real-Time control loops. Then, the potential impacts of the attack are analysed. An ML-based approach is proposed to detect poisoned KPI values before using them in control loops. Emulations are conducted to generate KPI reports and inject anomalies into the values. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model is used to detect anomalies. The results show that more amplified injected values are more accessible to detect, and using more report sequences leads to better performance in anomaly detection, with detection rates improving from 62% to 99%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE FNWF 2024</p></details> | None |

While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference.

QUIC's multiplexing capabilities, encrypted headers, dynamic IP address changes, and encrypted parameter negotiations make the protocol not only more efficient, secure, and censorship-resistant, but also practically unmanageable by firewalls. This opens doors for attackers who may exploit certain traits of the QUIC protocol to perform targeted attacks, such as data exfiltration attacks. Whereas existing data exfiltration techniques, such as TLS and DNS-based exfiltration, can be detected on a firewall level, QUIC-based data exfiltration is more difficult to detect, since changes in IP addresses and ports are inherent to the protocol's normal behavior. To show the feasibility of a QUIC-based data exfiltration attack, we introduce a novel method leveraging the server preferred address feature of the QUIC protocol and, thus, allows an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data from an infected machine to a malicious server, disguised as a server-side connection migration. The attack is implemented as a proof of concept tool in Rust. We evaluated the performance of five anomaly detection classifiers - Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Autoencoder, and Isolation Forest - trained on datasets collected from three network traffic scenarios. The classifiers were trained on over 700K benign and malicious QUIC packets and 786 connection migration events, but were unable to detect the data exfiltration attempts. Furthermore, post-analysis of the traffic captures did not reveal any identifiable fingerprint. As part of our evaluation, we also interviewed five leading firewall vendors and found that, as of today, no major firewall vendor implements functionality capable of distinguishing between benign and malicious QUIC connection migrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 table | None |

To defend against these threats, it is essential to have anomaly detection systems that can identify a variety of malicious behaviors. However, a significant challenge in this area is the limited availability of training data. Existing datasets often do not provide sufficient coverage of the diverse API structures, parameter formats, and usage patterns encountered in real-world scenarios. As a result, models trained on these datasets often struggle to generalize and may fail to detect less common or emerging attack vectors. To enhance detection accuracy and robustness, it is crucial to access larger and more representative datasets that capture the true variability of API traffic. To address this, we introduce a GAN-inspired learning framework that extends limited API traffic datasets through targeted, domain-aware synthesis. Drawing on techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), our approach leverages Transformer-based architectures, particularly RoBERTa, to enhance the contextual representation of API requests and generate realistic synthetic samples aligned with security-specific semantics. We evaluate our framework on two benchmark datasets, CSIC 2010 and ATRDF 2023, and compare it with a previous data augmentation technique to assess the importance of domain-specific synthesis. In addition, we apply our augmented data to various anomaly detection models to evaluate its impact on classification performance. Our method achieves up to a 4.94% increase in F1 score on CSIC 2010 and up to 21.10% on ATRDF 2023.

Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels.

These interactions may appear as harmless spam or escalate into sophisticated scam attempts, making it difficult to flag malicious intent early. Traditional detection methods often rely on static anomaly detection techniques that fail to adapt to dynamic conversational shifts. One key limitation is the misinterpretation of benign topic transitions referred to as concept drift as fraudulent behavior, leading to either false alarms or missed threats. We propose a two stage detection framework that first identifies suspicious conversations using a tailored ensemble classification model. To improve the reliability of detection, we incorporate a concept drift analysis step using a One Class Drift Detector (OCDD) to isolate conversational shifts within flagged dialogues. When drift is detected, a large language model (LLM) assesses whether the shift indicates fraudulent manipulation or a legitimate topic change. In cases where no drift is found, the behavior is inferred to be spam like. We validate our framework using a dataset of social engineering chat scenarios and demonstrate its practical advantages in improving both accuracy and interpretability for real time fraud detection. To contextualize the trade offs, we compare our modular approach against a Dual LLM baseline that performs detection and judgment using different language models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the presence of sensitive information in these logs poses significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers that could lead to re-identification risks. While general data privacy has been extensively studied, the specific domain of privacy in software logs remains underexplored, with inconsistent definitions of sensitivity and a lack of standardized guidelines for anonymization. To mitigate this gap, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of privacy in software logs from multiple perspectives. We start by performing an analysis of 25 publicly available log datasets to identify potentially sensitive attributes. Based on the result of this step, we focus on three perspectives: privacy regulations, research literature, and industry practices. We first analyze key data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to understand the legal requirements concerning sensitive information in logs. Second, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify common privacy attributes and practices in log anonymization, revealing gaps in existing approaches. Finally, we survey 45 industry professionals to capture practical insights on log anonymization practices. Our findings shed light on various perspectives of log privacy and reveal industry challenges, such as technical and efficiency issues while highlighting the need for standardized guidelines. By combining insights from regulatory, academic, and industry perspectives, our study aims to provide a clearer framework for identifying and protecting sensitive information in software logs.</p></details> |  | None |

Hence, it is crucial for robust task performance to learn how to coordinate end-effector pose and applied force, monitor execution, and react to deviations. To address these challenges, we propose a learning approach that directly infers both low- and high-level task representations from user demonstrations on the real system. We developed an unsupervised task segmentation algorithm that combines intention recognition and feature clustering to infer the skills of a task. We leverage the inferred characteristic features of each skill in a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach to identify deviations from the intended task execution. Together, these components form a comprehensive framework capable of incrementally learning task decisions and new behaviors as new situations arise. Compared to state-of-the-art learning techniques, our approach significantly reduces the required amount of training data and computational complexity while efficiently learning complex in-contact behaviors and recovery strategies. Our proposed task segmentation and anomaly detection approaches outperform state-of-the-art methods on force-based tasks evaluated on two different robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted for publication by the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 26 pages</p></details> | None |

Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Detecting Spelling and Grammatical Anomalies in Russian Poetry Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04507v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of natural language texts in fine-tuning datasets plays a critical role in the performance of generative models, particularly in computational creativity tasks such as poem or song lyric generation. Fluency defects in generated poems significantly reduce their value. However, training texts are often sourced from internet-based platforms without stringent quality control, posing a challenge for data engineers to manage defect levels effectively. To address this issue, we propose the use of automated linguistic anomaly detection to identify and filter out low-quality texts from training datasets for creative models. In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of unsupervised and supervised text anomaly detection approaches, utilizing both synthetic and human-labeled datasets. We also introduce the RUPOR dataset, a collection of Russian-language human-labeled poems designed for cross-sentence grammatical error detection, and provide the full evaluation code. Our work aims to empower the community with tools and insights to improve the quality of training datasets for generative models in creative domains.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Federated Semi-Supervised and Semi-Asynchronous Learning for Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11981v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing FL-based approaches are based on the unrealistic assumption that the data on the client-side is fully annotated with ground truths. Furthermore, it is a great challenge how to improve the training efficiency while ensuring the detection accuracy in the highly heterogeneous and resource-constrained IoT networks. Meanwhile, the communication cost between clients and the server is also a problem that can not be ignored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Federated Semi-Supervised and Semi-Asynchronous (FedS3A) learning for anomaly detection in IoT networks. First, we consider a more realistic assumption that labeled data is only available at the server, and pseudo-labeling is utilized to implement federated semi-supervised learning, in which a dynamic weight of supervised learning is exploited to balance the supervised learning at the server and unsupervised learning at clients. Then, we propose a semi-asynchronous model update and staleness tolerant distribution scheme to achieve a trade-off between the round efficiency and detection accuracy. Meanwhile, the staleness of local models and the participation frequency of clients are considered to adjust their contributions to the global model. In addition, a group-based aggregation function is proposed to deal with the non-IID distribution of the data. Finally, the difference transmission based on the sparse matrix is adopted to reduce the communication cost. Extensive experimental results show that FedS3A can achieve greater than 98% accuracy even when the data is non-IID and is superior to the classic FL-based algorithms in terms of both detection performance and round efficiency, achieving a win-win situation. Meanwhile, FedS3A successfully reduces the communication cost by higher than 50%.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures | None |

A basic principle in cybersecurity is to be always alert. Therefore, automation is imperative in processes where the volume of daily operations is large. Several cybersecurity applications can be addressed as binary classification problems, including anomaly detection, fraud detection, intrusion detection, spam detection, or malware detection. We present three experiments. In the first experiment, we evaluate single classifiers including Random Forests, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree. In the second experiment, we test different sampling techniques including over-sampling, under-sampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, and Self-Paced Ensembling. In the last experiment, we evaluate Self-Paced Ensembling and its number of base classifiers. We found that imbalance learning techniques had positive and negative effects, as reported in related studies. Thus, these techniques should be applied with caution. Besides, we found different best performers for each dataset. Therefore, we recommend testing single classifiers and imbalance learning techniques for each new dataset and application involving imbalanced datasets as is the case in several cyber security applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures | None |

We present AnomalyMatch, an anomaly detection framework combining the semi-supervised FixMatch algorithm using EfficientNet classifiers with active learning. By treating anomaly detection as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, we efficiently utilise limited labelled and abundant unlabelled images. We allow iterative model refinement in a user interface for expert verification of high-confidence anomalies and correction of false positives. Built for astronomical data, AnomalyMatch generalises readily to other domains facing similar data challenges. Evaluations on the GalaxyMNIST astronomical dataset and the miniImageNet natural-image benchmark under severe class imbalance (1% anomalies for miniImageNet) display strong performance: starting from five to ten labelled anomalies and after three active learning cycles, we achieve an average AUROC of 0.95 (miniImageNet) and 0.86 (GalaxyMNIST), with respective AUPRC of 0.77 and 0.71. After active learning cycles, anomalies are ranked with 71% (miniImageNet) to 93% precision in the 1% of the highest-ranked images. AnomalyMatch is tailored for large-scale applications, efficiently processing predictions for 100 million images within three days on a single GPU. Integrated into ESAs Datalabs platform, AnomalyMatch facilitates targeted discovery of scientifically valuable anomalies in vast astronomical datasets. Our results underscore the exceptional utility and scalability of this approach for anomaly discovery, highlighting the value of specialised approaches for domains characterised by severe label scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal submission in preparation</p></details> | None |

However, existing anomaly detection datasets predominantly focus on surface defects in visible-light images, lacking publicly available X-ray datasets targeting internal defects in components. To address this gap, we construct the first publicly accessible component X-ray anomaly detection (CXR-AD) dataset, comprising real-world X-ray images. The dataset covers five industrial component categories, including 653 normal samples and 561 defect samples with precise pixel-level mask annotations. We systematically analyze the dataset characteristics and identify three major technical challenges: (1) strong coupling between complex internal structures and defect regions, (2) inherent low contrast and high noise interference in X-ray imaging, and (3) significant variations in defect scales and morphologies. To evaluate dataset complexity, we benchmark three state-of-the-art anomaly detection frameworks (feature-based, reconstruction-based, and zero-shot learning methods). Experimental results demonstrate a 29.78% average performance degradation on CXR-AD compared to MVTec AD, highlighting the limitations of current algorithms in handling internal defect detection tasks. To the best of our knowledge, CXR-AD represents the first publicly available X-ray dataset for component anomaly detection, providing a real-world industrial benchmark to advance algorithm development and enhance precision in internal defect inspection technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Uncertainty-aware Human Mobility Modeling and Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01281v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the temporal GPS coordinates from a large set of human agents, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly (e.g. bad-actor or malicious behavior) detection without any labeled data? Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been extensively studied, showcasing varying abilities to manage complex inputs and balance performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we formulate anomaly detection in complex human behavior by modeling raw GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each characterized by spatio-temporal features, along with trips (i.e. commute) between the stay-points. Our problem formulation allows us to leverage modern sequence models for unsupervised training and anomaly detection. Notably, we equip our proposed model USTAD (for Uncertainty-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection) with aleatoric (i.e. data) uncertainty estimation to account for inherent stochasticity in certain individuals' behavior, as well as epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty to handle data sparsity under a large variety of human behaviors. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties unlock a robust loss function as well as uncertainty-aware decision-making in anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments shows that USTAD improves anomaly detection AUCROC by 3\%-15\% over baselines in industry-scale data.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we present an explainable anomaly detection framework that identifies clinically meaningful increases in symptom severity using consumer-grade wearable data. Leveraging data from 2,023 participants with defined healthy baselines, our LSTM autoencoder model learned normal health patterns of sleep duration, step count, and resting heart rate. Anomalies were flagged when self-reported depression or anxiety scores increased by >=5 points (a threshold considered clinically significant). The model achieved an adjusted F1-score of 0.80 (precision = 0.73, recall = 0.88) in detecting 393 symptom-worsening episodes across 341 participants, with higher performance observed for episodes involving concurrent depression and anxiety escalation (F1 = 0.84) and for more pronounced symptom changes (>=10-point increases, F1 = 0.85). Model interpretability was supported by SHAP-based analysis, which identified resting heart rate as the most influential feature in 71.4 percentage of detected anomalies, followed by physical activity and sleep. Together, our findings highlight the potential of explainable anomaly detection to enable personalized, scalable, and proactive mental health monitoring in real-world settings.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, anomaly classification-distinguishing different types of anomalies-remains largely unexplored despite its critical importance in real-world inspection tasks. To address this gap, we propose VELM, a novel LLM-based pipeline for anomaly classification. Given the critical importance of inference speed, we first apply an unsupervised anomaly detection method as a vision expert to assess the normality of an observation. If an anomaly is detected, the LLM then classifies its type. A key challenge in developing and evaluating anomaly classification models is the lack of precise annotations of anomaly classes in existing datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce MVTec-AC and VisA-AC, refined versions of the widely used MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, which include accurate anomaly class labels for rigorous evaluation. Our approach achieves a state-of-the-art anomaly classification accuracy of 80.4% on MVTec-AD, exceeding the prior baselines by 5%, and 84% on MVTec-AC, demonstrating the effectiveness of VELM in understanding and categorizing anomalies. We hope our methodology and benchmark inspire further research in anomaly classification, helping bridge the gap between detection and comprehensive anomaly characterization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight presentation paper at the VAND Workshop, CVPR 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> | None |

We introduce a novel dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve robustness and precision.

To address this limitation, we propose Image-Event Fusion for Video Anomaly Detection (IEF-VAD), a framework that synthesizes event representations directly from RGB videos and fuses them with image features through a principled, uncertainty-aware process. The system (i) models heavy-tailed sensor noise with a Student`s-t likelihood, deriving value-level inverse-variance weights via a Laplace approximation; (ii) applies Kalman-style frame-wise updates to balance modalities over time; and (iii) iteratively refines the fused latent state to erase residual cross-modal noise. Without any dedicated event sensor or frame-level labels, IEF-VAD sets a new state of the art across multiple real-world anomaly detection benchmarks. These findings highlight the utility of synthetic event representations in emphasizing motion cues that are often underrepresented in RGB frames, enabling accurate and robust video understanding across diverse applications without requiring dedicated event sensors.

However, existing methods typically require carefully training a task-specific model for each category independently, leading to high cost, low efficiency, and weak generalization. Therefore, this paper presents a novel unified model for Multi-Category 3D Anomaly Detection (MC3D-AD) that aims to utilize both local and global geometry-aware information to reconstruct normal representations of all categories. First, to learn robust and generalized features of different categories, we propose an adaptive geometry-aware masked attention module that extracts geometry variation information to guide mask attention. Then, we introduce a local geometry-aware encoder reinforced by the improved mask attention to encode group-level feature tokens. Finally, we design a global query decoder that utilizes point cloud position embeddings to improve the decoding process and reconstruction ability. This leads to local and global geometry-aware reconstructed feature tokens for the AD task. MC3D-AD is evaluated on two publicly available Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, and exhibits significant superiority over current state-of-the-art single-category methods, achieving 3.1\% and 9.3\% improvement in object-level AUROC over Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet, respectively.

These cyber-physical systems depend on multiple sensor inputs, such as cameras, GPS receivers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, with faults potentially leading to physical instability and serious safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, anomaly detection has emerged as a crucial safeguarding mechanism, capable of identifying the physical manifestations of emerging issues and allowing operators to take preemptive action at runtime. Recent anomaly detection methods based on LSTM neural networks have shown promising results, but three challenges persist: the need for models that can generalise across the diverse mission profiles of drones; the need for interpretability, enabling operators to understand the nature of detected problems; and the need for capturing domain knowledge that is difficult to infer solely from log data. Motivated by these challenges, this paper introduces RADD, an integrated approach to anomaly detection in drones that combines rule mining and unsupervised learning. In particular, we leverage rules (or invariants) to capture expected relationships between sensors and actuators during missions, and utilise unsupervised learning techniques to cover more subtle relationships that the rules may have missed. We implement this approach using the ArduPilot drone software in the Gazebo simulator, utilising 44 rules derived across the main phases of drone missions, in conjunction with an ensemble of five unsupervised learning models. We find that our integrated approach successfully detects 93.84% of anomalies over six types of faults with a low false positive rate (2.33%), and can be deployed effectively at runtime. Furthermore, RADD outperforms a state-of-the-art LSTM-based method in detecting the different types of faults evaluated in our study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 29th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2025)</p></details> | None |

While numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data without compromising guaranteed FDR control.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.</p></details> |  | None |

Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging.

| **[Explainable Machine Learning for Cyberattack Identification from Traffic Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01488v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing automation of traffic management systems has made them prime targets for cyberattacks, disrupting urban mobility and public safety. Traditional network-layer defenses are often inaccessible to transportation agencies, necessitating a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on traffic flow data. In this study, we simulate cyberattacks in a semi-realistic environment, using a virtualized traffic network to analyze disruption patterns. We develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system, demonstrating that Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance are key indicators of compromised signals. To enhance interpretability, we apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, identifying critical decision factors and diagnosing misclassification errors. Our analysis reveals two primary challenges: transitional data inconsistencies, where mislabeled recovery-phase traffic misleads the model, and model limitations, where stealth attacks in low-traffic conditions evade detection. This work enhances AI-driven traffic security, improving both detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart transportation systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01476v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 10 tables, accepted by Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning ( ICML 2025 )</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD) |
| **[Secure Cluster-Based Hierarchical Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01186v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to address challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to adversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly compromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL architecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient ascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment for each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity analyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional deviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive thresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric, dynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each vehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing vehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented, which assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy vehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency check is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple compromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms form a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and 3-hop topologies.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[FreCT: Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer for Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00941v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is critical for system monitoring and risk identification, across various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, IMUs are susceptible to physical attacks, including acoustic resonant and electromagnetic interference attacks, resulting in immediate UAV crashes. Consequently, we introduce a Model-based Anomaly detection and Recovery System (MARS) that enables UAVs to quickly detect adversarial attacks on inertial sensors and achieve dynamic flight recovery. MARS features an attack-resilient state estimator based on the Extended Kalman Filter, which incorporates position, velocity, heading, and rotor speed measurements to reconstruct accurate attitude and angular velocity information for UAV control. Moreover, a statistical anomaly detection system monitors IMU sensor data, raising a system-level alert if an attack is detected. Upon receiving the alert, a multi-stage dynamic flight recovery strategy suspends the ongoing mission, stabilizes the drone in a hovering condition, and then resumes tasks under the resilient control. Experimental results in PX4 software-in-the-loop environments as well as real-world MARS-PX4 autopilot-equipped drones demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing IMU-defense frameworks, showcasing the ability of the UAVs to survive attacks and complete the missions.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents an AI-powered Insider Risk Management (IRM) system that integrates behavioral analytics, dynamic risk scoring, and real-time policy enforcement to detect and mitigate insider threats with high accuracy and adaptability. We introduce a hybrid scoring mechanism - transitioning from the static PRISM model to an adaptive AI-based model utilizing an autoencoder neural network trained on expert-annotated user activity data. Through iterative feedback loops and continuous learning, the system reduces false positives by 59% and improves true positive detection rates by 30%, demonstrating substantial gains in detection precision. Additionally, the platform scales efficiently, processing up to 10 million log events daily with sub-300ms query latency, and supports automated enforcement actions for policy violations, reducing manual intervention. The IRM system's deployment resulted in a 47% reduction in incident response times, highlighting its operational impact. Future enhancements include integrating explainable AI, federated learning, graph-based anomaly detection, and alignment with Zero Trust principles to further elevate its adaptability, transparency, and compliance-readiness. This work establishes a scalable and proactive framework for mitigating emerging insider risks in both on-premises and hybrid environments.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods face significant challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE) framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  | None |

This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which incorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep learning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification. We conduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the integration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline. Anomaly maps, generated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from normal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous regions. We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the mean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). On the external test set, adU-Net achieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net model (0.605). The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection into segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with ADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for publication at 2025 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC) Copyright 2025 IEEE.

The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A real-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed to illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with enhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures | None |
| **[Learning Multi-view Multi-class Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21294v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The latest trend in anomaly detection is to train a unified model instead of training a separate model for each category. However, existing multi-class anomaly detection (MCAD) models perform poorly in multi-view scenarios because they often fail to effectively model the relationships and complementary information among different views. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-View Multi-Class Anomaly Detection model (MVMCAD), which integrates information from multiple views to accurately identify anomalies. Specifically, we propose a semi-frozen encoder, where a pre-encoder prior enhancement mechanism is added before the frozen encoder, enabling stable cross-view feature modeling and efficient adaptation for improved anomaly detection. Furthermore, we propose an Anomaly Amplification Module (AAM) that models global token interactions and suppresses normal regions to enhance anomaly signals, leading to improved detection performance in multi-view settings. Finally, we propose a Cross-Feature Loss that aligns shallow encoder features with deep decoder features and vice versa, enhancing the model's sensitivity to anomalies at different semantic levels under multi-view scenarios. Extensive experiments on the Real-IAD dataset for multi-view multi-class anomaly detection validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 91.0/88.6/82.1 and 99.1/43.9/48.2/95.2 for image-level and the pixel-level, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CAShift: Benchmarking Log-Based Cloud Attack Detection under Normality Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09115v4)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of cloud-native computing, securing cloud environments has become an important task. Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD) is the most representative technique used in different systems for attack detection and safety guarantee, where multiple LAD methods and relevant datasets have been proposed. However, even though some of these datasets are specifically prepared for cloud systems, they only cover limited cloud behaviors and lack information from a whole-system perspective. Another critical issue to consider is normality shift, which implies that the test distribution could differ from the training distribution and highly affect the performance of LAD. Unfortunately, existing works only focus on simple shift types such as chronological changes, while other cloud-specific shift types are ignored. Therefore, a dataset that captures diverse cloud system behaviors and various types of normality shifts is essential. To fill this gap, we construct a dataset CAShift to evaluate the performance of LAD in cloud, which considers different roles of software in cloud systems, supports three real-world normality shift types and features 20 different attack scenarios in various cloud system components. Based on CAShift, we evaluate the effectiveness of existing LAD methods in normality shift scenarios. Additionally, to explore the feasibility of shift adaptation, we further investigate three continuous learning approaches to mitigate the impact of distribution shift. Results demonstrated that 1) all LAD methods suffer from normality shift where the performance drops up to 34%, and 2) existing continuous learning methods are promising to address shift drawbacks, but the configurations highly affect the shift adaptation. Based on our findings, we offer valuable implications for future research in designing more robust LAD models and methods for LAD shift adaptation.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 | None |

Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is an important task in various time-series applications such as e-commerce, cybersecurity, vehicle maintenance, and healthcare monitoring. However, this task is very challenging as it requires considering both the intra-variable dependency (relationships within a variable over time) and the inter-variable dependency (relationships between multiple variables) existing in time-series data. Recent graph-based approaches have made impressive progress in tackling the challenges of this field. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date review of TSAD using graphs, referred to as G-TSAD. First, we explore the significant potential of graph representation for time-series data and and its contributions to facilitating anomaly detection. Then, we review state-of-the-art graph anomaly detection techniques, mostly leveraging deep learning architectures, in the context of time series. For each method, we discuss its strengths, limitations, and the specific applications where it excels. Finally, we address both the technical and application challenges currently facing the field, and suggest potential future directions for advancing research and improving practical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (IEEE TPAMI)</p></details> | None |

Existing studies report on their capability to support various data-driven process analyses and even, to some extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This reasoning ability suggests that there is potential for LLMs to tackle semantics-aware process mining tasks, which are tasks that rely on an understanding of the meaning of activities and their relationships. Examples of these include process discovery, where the meaning of activities can indicate their dependency, whereas in anomaly detection the meaning can be used to recognize process behavior that is abnormal. In this paper, we systematically explore the capabilities of LLMs for such tasks. Unlike prior work, which largely evaluates LLMs in their default state, we investigate their utility through both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define five process mining tasks requiring semantic understanding and provide extensive benchmarking datasets for evaluation. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs struggle with challenging process mining tasks when used out of the box or with minimal in-context examples, they achieve strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks across a broad range of process types and industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, submitted to PS</p></details> | None |

To ensure data quality and integrity, advanced validation techniques were implemented utilizing models such as BERT's Next Sentence Prediction for sentence coherence, GPT-2 for overall plausibility, RoBERTa for logical consistency, autoencoders for anomaly detection, and conducted diversity analysis. Synthetic data that met all validation criteria were integrated into a comprehensive PostgreSQL database, serving as the data management system for the EHR application.

Safety is achieved by managing actuation (where electric signals are used to trigger physical movement), dependent on corresponding sensor readings; used as ground truth in decision making. Timely detection of anomalies (attacks, faults and unascertained states) in ICSs is crucial for the safe running of a plant, the safety of its personnel, and for the safe provision of any services provided. We propose an anomaly detection method that involves accurate linearization of the non-linear forms arising from sensor-actuator(s) relationships, primarily because solving linear models is easier and well understood. Further, the time complexity of the anomaly detection scenario/problem at hand is lowered using dimensionality reduction of the actuator(s) in relationship with a sensor. We accomplish this by using a well-known water treatment testbed as a use case. Our experiments show millisecond time response to detect anomalies and provide explainability; that are not simultaneously achieved by other state of the art AI/ML models with eXplainable AI (XAI) used for the same purpose.

The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures | None |

In the literature, ECG, actigraphy, speech, voice, and facial analysis have proven effective at detecting patients' emotions. On the other hand, these tools are invasive and do not integrate smoothly into the patient's daily life. HRV has also been proven to effectively indicate stress conditions, especially in combination with other signals. However, when HRV is derived from less invasive devices than the ECG, like wristbands and smartwatches, the quality of measurements significantly degrades. This paper presents a methodology for stress detection from a wristband based on a universal model for time series, UniTS, which we finetuned for the task and equipped with explainability features. We cast the problem as anomaly detection rather than classification to favor model adaptation to individual patients and allow the clinician to maintain greater control over the system's predictions. We demonstrate that our proposed model considerably surpasses 12 top-performing methods on three benchmark datasets. Furthermore, unlike other state-of-the-art systems, UniTS enables seamless monitoring, as it shows comparable performance when using signals from invasive or lightweight devices.</p></details> | 38 pages, 10 figures | None |

To overcome this challenge, researchers have started employing anomaly generation approaches to augment the anomaly dataset. However, existing anomaly generation methods suffer from limited diversity in the generated anomalies and struggle to achieve a seamless blending of this anomaly with the original image. Moreover, the generated mask is usually not aligned with the generated anomaly. In this paper, we overcome these challenges from a new perspective, simultaneously generating a pair of the overall image and the corresponding anomaly part. We propose DualAnoDiff, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly image generation model, which can generate diverse and realistic anomaly images by using a dual-interrelated diffusion model, where one of them is employed to generate the whole image while the other one generates the anomaly part. Moreover, we extract background and shape information to mitigate the distortion and blurriness phenomenon in few-shot image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, realism and the accuracy of mask. Overall, our approach significantly improves the performance of downstream anomaly inspection tasks, including anomaly detection, anomaly localization, and anomaly classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods select Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data as backdoor watermarks and retrain the original model for copyright protection. However, existing methods are susceptible to malicious detection and forgery by adversaries, resulting in watermark evasion. In this work, we propose Model-\underline{ag}nostic Black-box Backdoor W\underline{ate}rmarking Framework (AGATE) to address stealthiness and robustness challenges in multimodal model copyright protection. Specifically, we propose an adversarial trigger generation method to generate stealthy adversarial triggers from ordinary dataset, providing visual fidelity while inducing semantic shifts. To alleviate the issue of anomaly detection among model outputs, we propose a post-transform module to correct the model output by narrowing the distance between adversarial trigger image embedding and text embedding. Subsequently, a two-phase watermark verification is proposed to judge whether the current model infringes by comparing the two results with and without the transform module. Consequently, we consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods across five datasets in the downstream tasks of multimodal image-text retrieval and image classification. Additionally, we validated the robustness of AGATE under two adversarial attack scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a DT platform designed for a Spanish water supply network, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict water consumption. However, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). These attacks manipulate critical model parameters, injecting subtle distortions that degrade forecasting accuracy. To further exploit these vulnerabilities, we introduce a Learning Automata (LA) and Random LA-based approach that dynamically adjusts perturbations, making adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. Experimental results show that this approach significantly impacts prediction reliability, causing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to rise from 26% to over 35%.

However, as these vehicles become more connected, cybersecurity threats have emerged as a serious concern. Protecting the security and integrity of autonomous systems is essential to prevent malicious activities that can harm passengers, other road users, and the overall transportation network. This paper focuses on addressing the cybersecurity issues in autonomous vehicles by examining the challenges and risks involved, which are important for building a secure future. Since autonomous vehicles depend on the communication between sensors, artificial intelligence, external infrastructure, and other systems, they are exposed to different types of cyber threats. A cybersecurity breach in an autonomous vehicle can cause serious problems, including a loss of public trust and safety. Therefore, it is very important to develop and apply strong cybersecurity measures to support the growth and acceptance of self-driving cars. This paper discusses major cybersecurity challenges like vulnerabilities in software and hardware, risks from wireless communication, and threats through external interfaces. It also reviews existing solutions such as secure software development, intrusion detection systems, cryptographic protocols, and anomaly detection methods. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of regulatory bodies, industry collaborations, and cybersecurity standards in creating a secure environment for autonomous vehicles. Setting clear rules and best practices is necessary for consistent protection across manufacturers and regions. By analyzing the current cybersecurity landscape and suggesting practical countermeasures, this paper aims to contribute to the safe development and public trust of autonomous vehicle technology.</p></details> | 22 pages | None |
| **[A Novel Multilevel Taxonomical Approach for Describing High-Dimensional Unlabeled Movement Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20174v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Movement data is prevalent across various applications and scientific fields, often characterized by its massive scale and complexity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in summarizing and describing such data, enabling researchers to generate insights and support scientific hypotheses. Despite its importance, traditional EDA practices face limitations when applied to high-dimensional, unlabeled movement data. The complexity and multi-faceted nature of this type of data require more advanced methods that go beyond the capabilities of current EDA techniques. This study addresses the gap in current EDA practices by proposing a novel approach that leverages movement variable taxonomies and outlier detection. We hypothesize that organizing movement features into a taxonomy, and applying anomaly detection to combinations of taxonomic nodes, can reveal meaningful patterns and lead to more interpretable descriptions of the data. To test this hypothesis, we introduce TUMD, a new method that integrates movement taxonomies with outlier detection to enhance data analysis and interpretation. TUMD was evaluated across four diverse datasets of moving objects using fixed parameter values. Its effectiveness was assessed through two passes: the first pass categorized the majority of movement patterns as Kinematic, Geometric, or Hybrid for all datasets, while the second pass refined these behaviors into more specific categories such as Speed, Acceleration, or Indentation. TUMD met the effectiveness criteria in three datasets, demonstrating its ability to describe and refine movement behaviors. The results confirmed our hypothesis, showing that the combination of movement taxonomies and anomaly detection successfully uncovers meaningful and interpretable patterns within high-dimensional, unlabeled movement data.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Shopformer: Transformer-Based Framework for Detecting Shoplifting via Human Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19970v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shoplifting remains a costly issue for the retail sector, but traditional surveillance systems, which are mostly based on human monitoring, are still largely ineffective, with only about 2% of shoplifters being arrested. Existing AI-based approaches rely on pixel-level video analysis which raises privacy concerns, is sensitive to environmental variations, and demands significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we introduce Shopformer, a novel transformer-based model that detects shoplifting by analyzing pose sequences rather than raw video. We propose a custom tokenization strategy that converts pose sequences into compact embeddings for efficient transformer processing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pose-sequence-based transformer model for shoplifting detection. Evaluated on real-world pose data, our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection models, offering a privacy-preserving, and scalable solution for real-time retail surveillance.

| **[Unsupervised Tomato Split Anomaly Detection using Hyperspectral Imaging and Variational Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02921v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tomato anomalies/damages pose a significant challenge in greenhouse farming. While this method of cultivation benefits from efficient resource utilization, anomalies can significantly degrade the quality of farm produce. A common anomaly associated with tomatoes is splitting, characterized by the development of cracks on the tomato skin, which degrades its quality. Detecting this type of anomaly is challenging due to dynamic variations in appearance and sizes, compounded by dataset scarcity. We address this problem in an unsupervised manner by utilizing a tailored variational autoencoder (VAE) with hyperspectral input. Preliminary analysis of the dataset enabled us to select the optimal range of wavelengths for detecting this anomaly. Our findings indicate that the 530nm - 550nm range is suitable for identifying tomato dry splits. The proposed VAE model achieved a 97% detection accuracy for tomato split anomalies in the test data. The analysis on reconstruction loss allow us to not only detect the anomalies but also to some degree estimate the anomalous regions.</p></details> | CVPPA Workshop | None |
| **[LR-IAD:Mask-Free Industrial Anomaly Detection with Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19524v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for ensuring product quality by identifying defects. Traditional methods such as feature embedding and reconstruction-based approaches require large datasets and struggle with scalability. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) address some limitations but rely on mask annotations, leading to high implementation costs and false positives. Additionally, industrial datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA suffer from severe class imbalance, with defect samples constituting only 23.8% and 11.1% of total data respectively. To address these challenges, we propose a reward function that dynamically prioritizes rare defect patterns during training to handle class imbalance. We also introduce a mask-free reasoning framework using Chain of Thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) mechanisms, enabling anomaly detection directly from raw images without annotated masks. This approach generates interpretable step-by-step explanations for defect localization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches by 36% in accuracy on MVTec-AD and 16% on VisA. By eliminating mask dependency and reducing costs while providing explainable outputs, this work advances industrial anomaly detection and supports scalable quality control in manufacturing.

| **[Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-awareness Unknown Region for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19183v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of transformer-based architectures and large language models (LLMs), the accuracy of road scene perception has substantially advanced. Nonetheless, current road scene segmentation approaches are predominantly trained on closed-set data, resulting in insufficient detection capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. To overcome this limitation, road anomaly detection methods have been proposed. However, existing methods primarily depend on image inpainting and OOD distribution detection techniques, facing two critical issues: (1) inadequate consideration of the objectiveness attributes of anomalous regions, causing incomplete segmentation when anomalous objects share similarities with known classes, and (2) insufficient attention to environmental constraints, leading to the detection of anomalies irrelevant to autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-Awareness (SOTA) for autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, SOTA enhances the segmentation of objectiveness through a Semantic Fusion Block (SFB) and filters anomalies irrelevant to road navigation tasks using a Scene-understanding Guided Prompt-Context Adaptor (SG-PCA). Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fishyscapes Lost and Found, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly, demonstrate that the proposed SOTA consistently improves OOD detection performance across diverse detectors, achieving robust and accurate segmentation outcomes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the distributed and dynamic nature of microservices introduces complexities in ensuring system reliability, making anomaly detection crucial for maintaining performance and functionality. Anomalies stemming from network and performance issues must be swiftly identified and addressed. Existing anomaly detection techniques often rely on statistical models or machine learning methods that struggle with the high-dimensional, interdependent data inherent in microservice applications. Current techniques and available datasets predominantly focus on system traces and logs, limiting their ability to support advanced detection models. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing the RS-Anomic dataset generated using the open-source RobotShop microservice application. The dataset captures multivariate performance metrics and response times under normal and anomalous conditions, encompassing ten types of anomalies. We propose a novel anomaly detection model called Graph Attention and LSTM-based Microservice Anomaly Detection (GAL-MAD), leveraging Graph Attention and Long Short-Term Memory architectures to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in microservices. We utilize SHAP values to localize anomalous services and identify root causes to enhance explainability. Experimental results demonstrate that GAL-MAD outperforms state-of-the-art models on the RS-Anomic dataset, achieving higher accuracy and recall across varying anomaly rates. The explanations provide actionable insights into service anomalies, which benefits system administrators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - Journal of Universal Computer Science, 13 pages, preprint, 7 figures</p></details> | None |

Specifically, we evaluate the MOMENT family of models, a set of transformer-based, pre-trained architectures for multivariate time series tasks such as: imputation, prediction, classification, and anomaly detection. We evaluate the capacity of these models on five datasets to capture the underlying structures in time series data within their latent space projection and validate whether fine tuning improves the clarity of the resulting embedding spaces. Notable performance improvements in terms of loss reduction were observed after fine tuning. Visual analysis shows limited improvement in the interpretability of the embeddings, requiring further work. Results suggest that, although Time Series Foundation Models such as MOMENT are robust, their latent spaces may require additional methodological refinements to be adequately interpreted, such as alternative projection techniques, loss functions, or data preprocessing strategies. Despite the limitations of MOMENT, foundation models supose a big reduction in execution time and so a great advance for interactive visual analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at the International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence (IJIMAI)</p></details> | None |
| **[Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model for Subsurface Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18802v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban roads and infrastructure, vital to city operations, face growing threats from subsurface anomalies like cracks and cavities. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) effectively visualizes underground conditions employing electromagnetic (EM) waves; however, accurate anomaly detection via GPR remains challenging due to limited labeled data, varying subsurface conditions, and indistinct target boundaries. Although visually image-like, GPR data fundamentally represent EM waves, with variations within and between waves critical for identifying anomalies. Addressing these, we propose the Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model (Res-SAM), an innovative framework exploiting both visual discernibility and wave-changing properties of GPR data. Res-SAM initially identifies apparent candidate anomaly regions given minimal prompts, and further refines them by analyzing anomaly-induced changing information within and between EM waves in local GPR data, enabling precise and complete anomaly region extraction and category determination. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Res-SAM achieves high detection accuracy (>85%) and outperforms state-of-the-art. Notably, Res-SAM requires only minimal accessible non-target data, avoids intensive training, and incorporates simple human interaction to enhance reliability. Our research provides a scalable, resource-efficient solution for rapid subsurface anomaly detection across diverse environments, improving urban safety monitoring while reducing manual effort and computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

The method includes data preparation, model training, and evaluation, using an 80/20 (train/test) split. Models tested include eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Multiple-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (MO-GAAL), with XGB and MLP further combined with Random-Over-Sampling (ROS) and Self-Paced-Ensemble (SPE). Evaluation involves 5-fold cross-validation and imputation techniques (mean, median, and IterativeImputer) with 10, 20, 30, and 50 % missing data. Findings show XGB and MLP outperform generative models. IterativeImputer results are comparable to mean and median, but not recommended for large datasets due to increased complexity and execution time.

One of the active research questions is where (in the model architecture or training pipeline) and how to efficiently incorporate always limited human perceptual data into training strategies of models. In this paper, we introduce MENTOR (huMan pErceptioN-guided preTraining fOr increased geneRalization), which addresses this question through two unique rounds of training CNNs tasked with open-set anomaly detection. First, we train an autoencoder to learn human saliency maps given an input image, without any class labels. The autoencoder is thus tasked with discovering domain-specific salient features which mimic human perception. Second, we remove the decoder part, add a classification layer on top of the encoder, and train this new model conventionally, now using class labels. We show that MENTOR successfully raises the generalization performance across three different CNN backbones in a variety of anomaly detection tasks (demonstrated for detection of unknown iris presentation attacks, synthetically-generated faces, and anomalies in chest X-ray images) compared to traditional pretraining methods (e.g., sourcing the weights from ImageNet), and as well as state-of-the-art methods that incorporate human perception guidance into training. In addition, we demonstrate that MENTOR can be flexibly applied to existing human perception-guided methods and subsequently increasing their generalization with no architectural modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates \textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach. By combining multi-scale feature extraction with automatic relative association modeling, AMAD provides a robust and adaptable solution to UMTSAD challenges. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieving competitive performance results compared to SOTA benchmarks across a variety of datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>fix s...</summary><p>fix some grammar issues</p></details> | None |

A popular approach to unsupervised AD is clustering-based detection. However, this method lacks the ability to guarantee the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this paper, we propose SI-CLAD (Statistical Inference for CLustering-based Anomaly Detection), a novel statistical framework for testing the clustering-based AD results. The key strength of SI-CLAD lies in its ability to rigorously control the probability of falsely identifying anomalies, maintaining it below a pre-specified significance level $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$). By analyzing the selection mechanism inherent in clustering-based AD and leveraging the Selective Inference (SI) framework, we prove that false detection control is attainable. Moreover, we introduce a strategy to boost the true detection rate, enhancing the overall performance of SI-CLAD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets provide strong empirical support for our theoretical findings, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, data-driven models based on machine learning and big data analysis have emerged for calculation purposes, leveraging the information available in large datasets obtained from smart meters and other advanced measurement infrastructure. However, existing data-driven algorithms do not take into account the quality of data collected from smart meters. They lack built-in anomaly detection mechanisms and fail to differentiate anomalies based on whether the value or context of anomalous data instances deviates from the norm. This paper focuses on methods for detecting and mitigating the impact of anomalies on the consumption of active and reactive power datasets. It proposes an anomaly detection framework based on the Isolation Forest machine learning algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform filtering that works in both the time and frequency domain and is unaffected by point anomalies or contextual anomalies of the power consumption data. The importance of integrating anomaly detection methods is demonstrated in the analysis important for distribution networks with a high share of smart meters.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we combine Bayesian learning with recent developments in quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning, specifically orthogonal neural networks, to tackle this anomaly detection problem for an industrially relevant use case.

We develop orthogonal (quantum) versions of 3D convolutional neural networks and show that these models can successfully detect anomalies in 3D objects. To test the feasibility of incorporating quantum computers into a quantum-enhanced anomaly detection pipeline, we perform hardware experiments with our models on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane device, testing the effect of noise and limited measurement shots.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures | None |
| **[A Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Data Drift and Anomaly Identification Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory and Statistical Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18599v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data Drift is the phenomenon where the generating model behind the data changes over time. Due to data drift, any model built on the past training data becomes less relevant and inaccurate over time. Thus, detecting and controlling for data drift is critical in machine learning models. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins, inspired by how the human brain processes information. It is a biologically inspired model of memory that is similar in structure to the neocortex, and whose performance is claimed to be comparable to state of the art models in detecting anomalies in time series data. Another unique benefit of HTMs is its independence from training and testing cycle; all the learning takes place online with streaming data and no separate training and testing cycle is required. In sequential learning paradigm, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) offers some unique benefit for online learning and inference. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework combining HTM and SPRT for real-time data drift detection and anomaly identification. Unlike existing data drift methods, our approach eliminates frequent retraining and ensures low false positive rates. HTMs currently work with one dimensional or univariate data. In a second study, we also propose an application of HTM in multidimensional supervised scenario for anomaly detection by combining the outputs of multiple HTM columns, one for each dimension of the data, through a neural network. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional drift detection techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Wasserstein distance, and Population Stability Index (PSI) in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our experiments also provide insights into optimizing hyperparameters for real-time deployment in domains such as Telecom.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures | None |

DIVER enables run-time detection of anomalies and is targeted at devices running the real-time operating system (RTOS), VxWorks, which precludes traditional methods of implementing dynamic monitors using OS (e.g., Linux, Windows) functions. DIVER has two components. The "measurer" implant is embedded into the VxWorks kernel to collect run-time measurements and provide interactive/streaming interfaces over a TCP/IP port. The remote "listener" acquires and analyzes the measurements and provides an interactive user interface. DIVER focuses on small embedded devices with stringent resource constraints (e.g., insufficient storage to locally store measurements). We demonstrate efficacy of DIVER on the Motorola ACE Remote Terminal Unit used in CPS including power systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures | None |

Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.</p></details> |  | None |

In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Know Unreported Roadway Incidents in Real-time: Early Traffic Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10892v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research aims to know traffic anomalies as early as possible. A traffic anomaly refers to a generic incident on the road that influences traffic flow and calls for urgent traffic management measures. `Knowing'' the occurrence of a traffic anomaly is twofold: the ability to detect this anomaly before it is reported anywhere, or it may be such that an anomaly can be predicted before it actually occurs on the road (e.g., non-recurrent traffic breakdown). In either way, the objective is to inform traffic operators of unreported incidents in real time and as early as possible. The key is to stay ahead of the curve. Time is of the essence. Conventional automatic incident detection (AID) methods often struggle with early detection due to their limited consideration of spatial effects and early-stage characteristics. Therefore, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing prior domain knowledge and model-designing strategies. This allows the model to detect a broader range of anomalies, not only incidents that significantly influence traffic flow but also early characteristics of incidents along with historically unreported anomalies. We specially design the model to target the early-stage detection/prediction of an incident. Additionally, unlike most conventional AID studies, our method is highly scalable and generalizable, as it is fully automated with no manual selection of historical reports required, relies solely on widely available low-cost data, and requires no additional detectors. The experimental results across numerous road segments on different maps demonstrate that our model leads to more effective and early anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Several attempts to improve model generalization performance are heavily inspired by human perceptual intelligence, which is remarkable in both its performance and efficiency to generalize to unknown samples. Many of these methods attempt to force portions of the network to be orthogonal, following some observation within neuroscience related to early vision processes. In this paper, we propose a loss component that regularizes the filtering kernels in the first convolutional layer of a network to make them nearly orthogonal. Deviating from previous works, we give the network flexibility in which pairs of kernels it makes orthogonal, allowing the network to navigate to a better solution space, imposing harsh penalties. Without architectural modifications, we report substantial gains in generalization performance using the proposed loss against previous works (including orthogonalization- and saliency-based regularization methods) across three different architectures (ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, ViT-b-16) and two difficult open-set recognition tasks: presentation attack detection in iris biometrics, and anomaly detection in chest X-ray images.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a large language model (LLM)-based network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system. In addition to existing models such as autoencoders and decision trees, we harness the power of large language models for processing sequence data from network traffic, which allows us a better capture of underlying complex patterns, as well as slight fluctuations in the dataset. We show for a given detection task, the need for a hybrid model that incorporates the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture into a supervised learning framework in order to achieve better accuracy. A pre-trained large language model analyzes and predicts the probable network traffic, and an anomaly detection layer that considers temporality and context is added. Moreover, we present a novel transfer learning-based methodology to enhance the model's effectiveness to quickly adapt to unknown network structures and adversarial conditions without requiring extensive labeled datasets. Actual results show that the designed model outperforms traditional methods in detection accuracy and computational efficiency, effectively identify various network anomalies such as zero-day attacks and traffic congestion pattern, and significantly reduce the false positive rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of 2025 IEEE 7th International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering (CISCE 2025)</p></details> | None |

Existing intrusion detection and prevention methods provide limited security as adversaries continually adapt their attack strategies. We propose a dynamic attack detection and prevention approach to address this challenge. First, blockchain-based authentication uses the Deoxys Authentication Algorithm (DAA) to verify IoT device legitimacy before data transmission. Next, a bi-stage intrusion detection system is introduced: the first stage uses signature-based detection via an Improved Random Forest (IRF) algorithm. In contrast, the second stage applies feature-based anomaly detection using a Diffusion Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN). To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) and maintain Service Level Agreements (SLA), trust-aware service migration is performed using Heap-Based Optimization (HBO). Additionally, on-demand virtual High-Interaction honeypots deceive attackers and extract attack patterns, which are securely stored using the Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) to enhance signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The proposed framework is implemented in the NS3 simulation environment and evaluated against existing methods across multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, attack detection rate, false negative rate, precision, recall, ROC curve, memory usage, CPU usage, and execution time. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, reinforcing the security of NGWN-enabled IoT ecosystems</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering (TNSE) for possible publication</p></details> | None |

By training a Random Forest to discriminate between real data and synthetic data sampled from a uniform distribution over the real data bounds, a distance measure is obtained that anisometrically transforms the data, expanding distances at the boundary of the data manifold. We show that using distances recovered from this transformation improves the accuracy of unsupervised anomaly detection, compared to other commonly used detectors, demonstrated over a large number of benchmark datasets. As well as improved performance, this method has advantages over other unsupervised anomaly detection methods, including minimal requirements for data preprocessing, native handling of missing data, and potential for visualizations. By relating outlier scores to partitions of the Random Forest, we develop a method for locally explainable anomaly predictions in terms of feature importance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[CHASE: A Causal Hypergraph based Framework for Root Cause Analysis in Multimodal Microservice Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19711v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the widespread adoption of distributed microservice architectures within the industry has significantly increased the demand for enhanced system availability and robustness. Due to the complex service invocation paths and dependencies in enterprise-level microservice systems, it is challenging to locate the anomalies promptly during service invocations, thus causing intractable issues for normal system operations and maintenance. In this paper, we propose a Causal Heterogeneous grAph baSed framEwork for root cause analysis, namely CHASE, for microservice systems with multimodal data, including traces, logs, and system monitoring metrics. Specifically, related information is encoded into representative embeddings and further modeled by a multimodal invocation graph. Following that, anomaly detection is performed on each instance node with attentive heterogeneous message passing from its adjacent metric and log nodes. Finally, CHASE learns from the constructed hypergraph with hyperedges representing the flow of causality and performs root cause localization. We evaluate the proposed framework on two public microservice datasets with distinct attributes and compare with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that CHASE achieves the average performance gain up to 36.2%(A@1) and 29.4%(Percentage@1), respectively to its best counterpart.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional deterministic methods often fall short when it comes to capturing the inherent uncertainty of anomaly detection tasks. This paper introduces a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (VAE) equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms for detecting anomalies in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the purpose of improving anomaly detection performance, we incorporate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation through Bayesian inference. The model was tested on the BraTS2020 dataset, and the findings were a 0.83 ROC AUC and a 0.83 PR AUC. The data in our paper suggests that modeling uncertainty is an essential component of anomaly detection, enhancing both performance and interpretability and providing confidence estimates, as well as anomaly predictions, for clinicians to leverage in making medical decisions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |

By combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the algorithm is designed to detect abnormal behaviors in financial transactions. First, the GAN is used to generate simulated data that approximates normal payment flows. The discriminator identifies anomalous patterns in transactions, enabling the detection of potential fraud and money laundering behaviors. Second, a VAE is introduced to model the latent distribution of payment flows, ensuring that the generated data more closely resembles real transaction features, thus improving the model's detection accuracy. The method optimizes the generative capabilities of both GAN and VAE, ensuring that the model can effectively capture suspicious behaviors even in sparse data conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and other deep learning models across various evaluation metrics, especially in detecting rare fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed comparison of performance in recognizing different transaction patterns (such as normal, money laundering, and fraud) in large payment flows, validating the advantages of generative models in handling complex financial data.</p></details> |  | None |

Anomaly detection is crucial for such systems to facilitate predictive maintenance. However, most existing anomaly detection methods are designed for either univariate or single-system multivariate data, making them insufficient for these complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce M$^2$AD, a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series data from multiple systems. M$^2$AD employs deep models to capture expected behavior under normal conditions, using the residuals as indicators of potential anomalies. These residuals are then aggregated into a global anomaly score through a Gaussian Mixture Model and Gamma calibration. We theoretically demonstrate that this framework can effectively address heterogeneity and dependencies across sensors and systems. Empirically, M$^2$AD outperforms existing methods in extensive evaluations by 21% on average, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a large-scale real-world case study on 130 assets in Amazon Fulfillment Centers.

It is a crucial task when training data is not accessible due to various concerns, eg, data privacy, yet it is challenging since the models need to generalize to anomalies across different domains where the appearance of foreground objects, abnormal regions, and background features, such as defects/tumors on different products/organs, can vary significantly. Recently large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong zero-shot recognition ability in various vision tasks, including anomaly detection. However, their ZSAD performance is weak since the VLMs focus more on modeling the class semantics of the foreground objects rather than the abnormality/normality in the images. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, namely AnomalyCLIP, to adapt CLIP for accurate ZSAD across different domains. The key insight of AnomalyCLIP is to learn object-agnostic text prompts that capture generic normality and abnormality in an image regardless of its foreground objects. This allows our model to focus on the abnormal image regions rather than the object semantics, enabling generalized normality and abnormality recognition on diverse types of objects. Large-scale experiments on 17 real-world anomaly detection datasets show that AnomalyCLIP achieves superior zero-shot performance of detecting and segmenting anomalies in datasets of highly diverse class semantics from various defect inspection and medical imaging domains.

| **[GenCLIP: Generalizing CLIP Prompts for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14919v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to identify anomalies in unseen categories by leveraging CLIP's zero-shot capabilities to match text prompts with visual features. A key challenge in ZSAD is learning general prompts stably and utilizing them effectively, while maintaining both generalizability and category specificity. Although general prompts have been explored in prior works, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that learns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer prompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates category-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general prompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By combining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further enhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and generalization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a vision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while a query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from both branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across unseen categories. Additionally, we propose an adaptive text prompt filtering mechanism, which removes irrelevant or atypical class names not encountered during CLIP's training, ensuring that only meaningful textual inputs contribute to the final vision-language alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Memory-Augmented Dual-Decoder Networks for Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14884v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) have shifted from single-class to multi-class scenarios. In such complex contexts, the increasing pattern diversity has brought two challenges to reconstruction-based approaches: (1) over-generalization: anomalies that are subtle or share compositional similarities with normal patterns may be reconstructed with high fidelity, making them difficult to distinguish from normal instances; and (2) insufficient normality reconstruction: complex normal features, such as intricate textures or fine-grained structures, may not be faithfully reconstructed due to the model's limited representational capacity, resulting in false positives. Existing methods typically focus on addressing the former, which unintentionally exacerbate the latter, resulting in inadequate representation of intricate normal patterns. To concurrently address these two challenges, we propose a Memory-augmented Dual-Decoder Networks (MDD-Net). This network includes two critical components: a Dual-Decoder Reverse Distillation Network (DRD-Net) and a Class-aware Memory Module (CMM). Specifically, the DRD-Net incorporates a restoration decoder designed to recover normal features from synthetic abnormal inputs and an identity decoder to reconstruct features that maintain the anomalous semantics. By exploiting the discrepancy between features produced by two decoders, our approach refines anomaly scores beyond the conventional encoder-decoder comparison paradigm, effectively reducing false positives and enhancing localization accuracy. Furthermore, the CMM explicitly encodes and preserves class-specific normal prototypes, actively steering the network away from anomaly reconstruction. Comprehensive experimental results across several benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our MDD-Net framework over current SoTA approaches in multi-class UAD tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> | None |

To handle such complexity, operations teams rely on monitoring systems, including anomaly detection tools that identify unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we present c-ANEMON, a Contextual ANomaly dEtection MONitor for the RAN based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our solution captures spatio-temporal variations by analyzing the behavior of individual cells in relation to their local neighborhoods, enabling the detection of anomalies that are independent of external mobility factors. This, in turn, allows focusing on anomalies associated with network issues (e.g., misconfigurations, equipment failures). We evaluate c-ANEMON using real-world data from a large European metropolitan area (7,890 cells; 3 months). First, we show that the GNN model within our solution generalizes effectively to cells from previously unseen areas, suggesting the possibility of using a single model across extensive deployment regions. Then, we analyze the anomalies detected by c-ANEMON through manual inspection and define several categories of long-lasting anomalies (6+ hours). Notably, 45.95% of these anomalies fall into a category that is more likely to require intervention by operations teams.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

In this paper, we present a novel application of Hierarchical Robust Principal Component Analysis (HrPCA) as a scalable, unsupervised anomaly detection technique tailored to DQ monitoring in multi-level aggregation pipelines. We propose a modular framework that decomposes the data at each hierarchical level into low-rank representations and sparse residuals, allowing the detection of subtle inconsistencies, outliers, and misalignments in the aggregated data. We evaluated our approach using synthetic hierarchical datasets with controlled anomalies and demonstrated how HrPCA outperforms traditional rule-based methods in detecting data corruption and rollup inconsistencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 3 figures ,submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> | None |

It isn't easy to strike a balance between visual privacy and action recognition performance in most computer vision models. Is it possible to safeguard privacy without sacrificing performance? It poses a formidable challenge, as even minor privacy enhancements can lead to substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving image anonymization technique that optimizes the anonymizer using penalties from the utility branch, ensuring improved action recognition performance while minimally affecting privacy leakage. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing privacy leakage and maintaining high action performance. The proposed approach is primarily designed to align with the regulatory standards of the EU AI Act and GDPR, ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information while maintaining action performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a feature-based penalty scheme that exclusively controls the action features, allowing freedom to anonymize private attributes. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that applying a penalty to anonymizer from utility branch enhances action performance while maintaining nearly consistent privacy leakage across different penalty settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPRW 2025</p></details> | None |

Graph pre-training, the two-stage learning paradigm, has emerged as an effective approach for label-efficient learning, largely benefiting from expressive neighborhood aggregation under the assumption of strong homophily. However, in GAD, anomalies typically exhibit high local heterophily, while normal nodes retain strong homophily, resulting in a complex homophily-heterophily mixture. To understand the impact of this mixed pattern on graph pre-training, we analyze it through the lens of spectral filtering and reveal that relying solely on a global low-pass filter is insufficient for GAD. We further provide a theoretical justification for the necessity of selectively applying appropriate filters to individual nodes. Building upon this insight, we propose PAF, a Pre-Training and Adaptive Fine-tuning framework specifically designed for GAD. In particular, we introduce joint training with low- and high-pass filters in the pre-training phase to capture the full spectrum of frequency information in node features. During fine-tuning, we devise a gated fusion network that adaptively combines node representations generated by both filters. Extensive experiments across ten benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of PAF.</p></details> |  | None |

However, dedicated multimodal datasets specifically tailored for IAD remain limited. Pioneering datasets like MVTec 3D have laid essential groundwork in multimodal IAD by incorporating RGB+3D data, but still face challenges in bridging the gap with real industrial environments due to limitations in scale and resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Real-IAD D3, a high-precision multimodal dataset that uniquely incorporates an additional pseudo3D modality generated through photometric stereo, alongside high-resolution RGB images and micrometer-level 3D point clouds. Real-IAD D3 features finer defects, diverse anomalies, and greater scale across 20 categories, providing a challenging benchmark for multimodal IAD Additionally, we introduce an effective approach that integrates RGB, point cloud, and pseudo-3D depth information to leverage the complementary strengths of each modality, enhancing detection performance.

However, real-world sequential data often exhibit a superimposed state of various fluctuation patterns, including hourly, daily, and monthly frequencies. Traditional decomposition techniques struggle to effectively disentangle these multiple fluctuation patterns from the seasonal components, making time series analysis challenging. Surpassing the existing multi-period decoupling paradigms, this paper introduces a novel perspective based on energy distribution within the temporal-spectrum space. By adaptively quantifying observed sequences into continuous frequency band intervals, the proposed approach reconstructs fluctuation patterns across diverse periods without relying on domain-specific prior knowledge. Building upon this innovative strategy, we propose Pets, an enhanced architecture that is adaptable to arbitrary model structures. Pets integrates a Fluctuation Pattern Assisted (FPA) module and a Context-Guided Mixture of Predictors (MoP). The FPA module facilitates information fusion among diverse fluctuation patterns by capturing their dependencies and progressively modeling these patterns as latent representations at each layer. Meanwhile, the MoP module leverages these compound pattern representations to guide and regulate the reconstruction of distinct fluctuations hierarchically. Pets achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification, while demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods face two main challenges. First, it is difficult to directly model the dependencies of diverse and complex patterns within the sequences. Second, many methods that optimize parameters using mean squared error struggle with noise in the time series, leading to performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based framework built on decomposition (TransDe) for multivariate time series anomaly detection. The key idea is to combine the strengths of time series decomposition and transformers to effectively learn the complex patterns in normal time series data. A multi-scale patch-based transformer architecture is proposed to exploit the representative dependencies of each decomposed component of the time series. Furthermore, a contrastive learn paradigm based on patch operation is proposed, which leverages KL divergence to align the positive pairs, namely the pure representations of normal patterns between different patch-level views. A novel asynchronous loss function with a stop-gradient strategy is further introduced to enhance the performance of TransDe effectively. It can avoid time-consuming and labor-intensive computation costs in the optimization process. Extensive experiments on five public datasets are conducted and TransDe shows superiority compared with twelve baselines in terms of F1 score.

Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines.

Recent machine learning approaches for road anomaly detection have overcome the tedious and time-consuming process of manual analysis and anomaly counting; however, they often fall short in providing a complete characterization of road potholes. In this paper, we leverage transfer learning by adopting a pre-trained YOLOv8-seg model for the automatic characterization of potholes using digital images captured from a dashboard-mounted camera. Our work includes the creation of a novel dataset, comprising both images and their corresponding depth maps, collected from diverse road environments in Al-Khobar city and the KFUPM campus in Saudi Arabia. Our approach performs pothole detection and segmentation to precisely localize potholes and calculate their area. Subsequently, the segmented image is merged with its depth map to extract detailed depth information about the potholes. This integration of segmentation and depth data offers a more comprehensive characterization compared to previous deep learning-based road anomaly detection systems. Overall, this method not only has the potential to significantly enhance autonomous vehicle navigation by improving the detection and characterization of road hazards but also assists road maintenance authorities in responding more effectively to road damage.</p></details> |  | None |

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards a Multi-Agent Vision-Language System for Zero-Shot Novel Hazardous Object Detection for Autonomous Driving Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13399v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalous hazards in visual data, particularly in video streams, is a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Existing models often struggle with unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL (Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video. Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems.

However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Predicting BVD Re-emergence in Irish Cattle From Highly Imbalanced Herd-Level Data Using Machine Learning Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13116v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication programme in Ireland, with the herd-level prevalence declining from 11.3% in 2013 to just 0.2% in 2023. As the country moves toward BVD freedom, the development of predictive models for targeted surveillance becomes increasingly important to mitigate the risk of disease re-emergence. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including binary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting BVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an extensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample sizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting, and appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value, F1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently outperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest sensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023 herd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the number of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.</p></details> |  | None |

Quantum computing has recently emerged as a powerful tool for tackling several machine learning tasks, but training quantum machine learning models remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of gradient calculation. The challenge is even greater for anomaly detection, where unsupervised learning methods are essential to ensure practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose Quorum, the first quantum anomaly detection framework designed for unsupervised learning that operates without requiring any training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[EventVAD: Training-Free Event-Aware Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13092v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos. Supervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often struggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods leverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to detect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual transitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware video anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph architectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning. Specifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with time-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs adaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event boundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary detection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and improves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it utilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing reasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate that EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free settings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MathPhys-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Anomaly Synthesis with SQE-Driven Bi-Level Optimization for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12970v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a crucial task in computer vision, yet collecting real-world defect images is inherently difficult due to the rarity and unpredictability of anomalies. Consequently, researchers have turned to synthetic methods for training data augmentation. However, existing synthetic strategies (e.g., naive cut-and-paste or inpainting) overlook the underlying physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this thesis, we introduced a novel pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through Math-Physics model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality Estimator(SQE). By incorporating physical modeling of cracks, corrosion, and deformation, our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage (npcF++) further improves local fidelity using wavelet transforms and boundary synergy blocks. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To validate our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely adopted industrial anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD. Across these datasets, the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both image-AUROC and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of our MaPhC2F and BiSQAD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sliced-Wasserstein Distance-based Data Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12918v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the sliced-Wasserstein distance for training data selection in machine learning approaches. Our filtering technique is interesting for decision-making pipelines deploying machine learning models in critical sectors, e.g., power systems, as it offers a conservative data selection and an optimal transport interpretation. To ensure the scalability of our method, we provide two efficient approximations. The first approximation processes reduced-cardinality representations of the datasets concurrently. The second makes use of a computationally light Euclidian distance approximation. Additionally, we open the first dataset showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response in a northern climate. We present the filtering patterns of our method on synthetic datasets and numerically benchmark our method for training data selection. Finally, we employ our method as part of a first forecasting benchmark for our open-source dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.21712</p></details> | None |
| **[3D-PNAS: 3D Industrial Surface Anomaly Synthesis with Perlin Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12856v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models. While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored, limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS, based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane, sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale, perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LAD-Reasoner: Tiny Multimodal Models are Good Reasoners for Logical Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12749v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in industrial anomaly detection have highlighted the need for deeper logical anomaly analysis, where unexpected relationships among objects, counts, and spatial configurations must be identified and explained. Existing approaches often rely on large-scale external reasoning modules or elaborate pipeline designs, hindering practical deployment and interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly Detection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating logical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny multimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B. Our approach leverages a two-stage training paradigm that first employs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for fine-grained visual understanding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine logical anomaly detection and enforce coherent, human-readable reasoning. Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the detection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the need for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller, matches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further excels in producing concise and interpretable rationales. This unified design reduces reliance on large models and complex pipelines, while offering transparent and interpretable insights into logical anomaly detection. Code and data will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the real-world effectiveness of MUAD methods is questioned due to limitations in current Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) datasets. These datasets contain numerous classes that are unlikely to be produced by the same factory and fail to cover multiple structures or appearances. Additionally, the defects do not reflect real-world characteristics. Therefore, we introduce the Heterogeneous Same-Sort Industrial Anomaly Detection (HSS-IAD) dataset, which contains 8,580 images of metallic-like industrial parts and precise anomaly annotations. These parts exhibit variations in structure and appearance, with subtle defects that closely resemble the base materials. We also provide foreground images for synthetic anomaly generation. Finally, we evaluate popular IAD methods on this dataset under multi-class and class-separated settings, demonstrating its potential to bridge the gap between existing datasets and real factory conditions.

| **[A Comprehensive Study of Machine Learning Techniques for Log-Based Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16714v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Growth in system complexity increases the need for automated log analysis techniques, such as Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD). While deep learning (DL) methods have been widely used for LAD, traditional machine learning (ML) techniques can also perform well depending on the context and dataset. Semi-supervised techniques deserve the same attention as they offer practical advantages over fully supervised methods. Current evaluations mainly focus on detection accuracy, but this alone is insufficient to determine the suitability of a technique for a given LAD task. Other aspects to consider include training and prediction times as well as the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, which in practice matters to engineers. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating a wide range of supervised and semi-supervised, traditional and deep ML techniques across four criteria: detection accuracy, time performance, and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning in both detection accuracy and time performance. The experimental results show that supervised traditional and deep ML techniques fare similarly in terms of their detection accuracy and prediction time on most of the benchmark datasets considered in our study. Moreover, overall, sensitivity analysis to hyperparameter tuning with respect to detection accuracy shows that supervised traditional ML techniques are less sensitive than deep learning techniques. Further, semi-supervised techniques yield significantly worse detection accuracy than supervised techniques.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnomalyGen: An Automated Semantic Log Sequence Generation Framework with LLM for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12250v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of high-quality public log datasets has become a critical bottleneck in advancing log-based anomaly detection techniques. Current datasets exhibit three fundamental limitations: (1) incomplete event coverage, (2) artificial patterns introduced by static analysis-based generation frameworks, and (3) insufficient semantic awareness. To address these challenges, we present AnomalyGen, the first automated log synthesis framework specifically designed for anomaly detection. Our framework introduces a novel four-phase architecture that integrates enhanced program analysis with Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT reasoning), enabling iterative log generation and anomaly annotation without requiring physical system execution. Evaluations on Hadoop and HDFS distributed systems demonstrate that AnomalyGen achieves substantially broader log event coverage (38-95 times improvement over existing datasets) while producing more operationally realistic log sequences compared to static analysis-based approaches. When augmenting benchmark datasets with synthesized logs, we observe maximum F1-score improvements of 3.7% (average 1.8% improvement across three state-of-the-art anomaly detection models). This work not only establishes a high-quality benchmarking resource for automated log analysis but also pioneers a new paradigm for applying large language models (LLMs) in software engineering workflows.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LO2: Microservice API Anomaly Dataset of Logs and Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12067v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context. Microservice-based systems have gained significant attention over the past years. A critical factor for understanding and analyzing the behavior of these systems is the collection of monitoring data such as logs, metrics, and traces. These data modalities can be used for anomaly detection and root cause analysis of failures. In particular, multi-modal methods utilizing several types of this data at once have gained traction in the research community since these three modalities capture different dimensions of system behavior. Aim. We provide a dataset that supports research on anomaly detection and architectural degradation in microservice systems. We generate a comprehensive dataset of logs, metrics, and traces from a production microservice system to enable the exploration of multi-modal fusion methods that integrate multiple data modalities. Method. We dynamically tested the various APIs of the MS-based system, implementing the OAuth2.0 protocol using the Locust tool. For each execution of the prepared test suite, we collect logs and performance metrics for correct and erroneous calls with data labeled according to the error triggered during the call. Contributions. We collected approximately 657,000 individual log files, totaling over two billion log lines. In addition, we collected more than 45 million individual metric files that contain 485 unique metrics. We provide an initial analysis of logs, identify key metrics through PCA, and discuss challenges in collecting traces for this system. Moreover, we highlight the possibilities for making a more fine-grained version of the data set. This work advances anomaly detection in microservice systems using multiple data sources.</p></details> |  | None |
