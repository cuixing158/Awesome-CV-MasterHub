| **[Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion for Ransomware Detection: A Probabilistic Approach to Behavioral Anomaly Isolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03882v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of cryptographic extortion techniques has necessitated the development of adaptive detection frameworks capable of identifying adversarial encryption behaviors without reliance on predefined signatures. Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion (HED) introduces a structured entropy-based anomaly classification mechanism that systematically tracks fluctuations in entropy evolution to differentiate between benign cryptographic processes and unauthorized encryption attempts. The integration of hierarchical clustering, entropy profiling, and probabilistic diffusion modeling refines detection granularity, ensuring that encryption anomalies are identified despite obfuscation strategies or incremental execution methodologies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that HED maintained high classification accuracy across diverse ransomware families, outperforming traditional heuristic-based and signature-driven approaches while reducing false positive occurrences. Comparative analysis highlighted that entropy-driven anomaly segmentation improved detection efficiency under variable system workload conditions, ensuring real-time classification feasibility. The computational overhead associated with entropy anomaly detection remained within operational constraints, reinforcing the suitability of entropy-driven classification for large-scale deployment. The ability to identify adversarial entropy manipulations before encryption completion contributes to broader cybersecurity defenses, offering a structured methodology for isolating unauthorized cryptographic activities within heterogeneous computing environments. The results further emphasized that entropy evolution modeling facilitates predictive anomaly detection, enhancing resilience against encryption evasion techniques designed to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> | None |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection with Contours - A Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19588v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection prior art is rooted on the assumption that abnormal events can be mostly regarded as a result of uncommon human behavior. Opposed to utilizing skeleton representations of humans, however, we investigate the potential of learning recurrent motion patterns of normal human behavior using 2D contours. Keeping all advantages of pose-based methods, such as increased object anonymization, the shift from human skeletons to contours is hypothesized to leave the opportunity to cover more object categories open for future research. We propose formulating the problem as a regression and a classification task, and additionally explore two distinct data representation techniques for contours. To further reduce the computational complexity of Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection solutions, all methods in this study are based on shallow Neural Networks from the field of Deep Learning, and evaluated on the three most prominent benchmark datasets within Video Anomaly Detection and their human-related counterparts, totaling six datasets. Our results indicate that this novel perspective on Pose-based Video Anomaly Detection marks a promising direction for future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Post-Hoc Calibrated Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19577v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unsupervised anomaly detection has seen improvements in a supervised binary classification paradigm in which auxiliary external data is included in the training set as anomalous data in a process referred to as outlier exposure, which opens the possibility of exploring the efficacy of post-hoc calibration for anomaly detection and localization. Post-hoc Platt scaling and Beta calibration are found to improve results with gradient-based input perturbation, as well as post-hoc training with a strictly proper loss of a base model initially trained on an unsupervised loss. Post-hoc calibration is also found at times to be more effective using random synthesized spectral data as labeled anomalous data in the calibration set, suggesting that outlier exposure is superior only for initial training.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Using Anomaly Detection to Detect Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08486v4)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks such as poisoning attacks have attracted the attention of many machine learning researchers. Traditionally, poisoning attacks attempt to inject adversarial training data in order to manipulate the trained model. In federated learning (FL), data poisoning attacks can be generalized to model poisoning attacks, which cannot be detected by simpler methods due to the lack of access to local training data by the detector. State-of-the-art poisoning attack detection methods for FL have various weaknesses, e.g., the number of attackers has to be known or not high enough, working with i.i.d. data only, and high computational complexity. To overcome above weaknesses, we propose a novel framework for detecting poisoning attacks in FL, which employs a reference model based on a public dataset and an auditor model to detect malicious updates. We implemented a detector based on the proposed framework and using a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), which reaches the lowest possible computational complexity O(K) where K is the number of clients. We evaluated our detector's performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) poisoning attacks for two typical applications of FL: electrocardiograph (ECG) classification and human activity recognition (HAR). Our experimental results validated the performance of our detector over other SOTA detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We will updated this article soon</p></details> | None |
| **[Social Network User Profiling for Anomaly Detection Based on Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19380v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a risk pricing anomaly detection method for social network user portraits based on graph neural networks (GNNs), aiming to improve the ability to identify abnormal users in social network environments. In view of the limitations of traditional methods in social network data modeling, this paper combines graph autoencoders (GAEs) and graph attention networks (GATs) to achieve accurate detection of abnormal users through dynamic aggregation of neighbor features and reconstruction error evaluation. The Facebook Page-Page Network dataset is used in the experiment and compared with VAE, GNN, Transformer and GAE. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in AUC, F1-score, Precision and Recall, verifying its effectiveness. In addition, this paper explores the computational efficiency of the model in large-scale data and looks forward to combining self-supervised learning, federated learning, and other technologies in the future to improve the robustness and privacy protection of risk assessment. The research results can provide efficient anomaly detection solutions for financial risk control, social security management, and other fields.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Correcting Deviations from Normality: A Reformulated Diffusion Model for Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19357v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have spurred research into their application for Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection. However, these methods may struggle with maintaining structural integrity and recovering the anomaly-free content of abnormal regions, especially in multi-class scenarios. Furthermore, diffusion models are inherently designed to generate images from pure noise and struggle to selectively alter anomalous regions of an image while preserving normal ones. This leads to potential degradation of normal regions during reconstruction, hampering the effectiveness of anomaly detection. This paper introduces a reformulation of the standard diffusion model geared toward selective region alteration, allowing the accurate identification of anomalies. By modeling anomalies as noise in the latent space, our proposed Deviation correction diffusion (DeCo-Diff) model preserves the normal regions and encourages transformations exclusively on anomalous areas. This selective approach enhances the reconstruction quality, facilitating effective unsupervised detection and localization of anomaly regions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method in accurately identifying and localizing anomalies in complex images, with pixel-level AUPRC improvements of 11-14% over state-of-the-art models on well known anomaly detection datasets.

| **[On Diffusion Modeling for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18593v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Known for their impressive performance in generative modeling, diffusion models are attractive candidates for density-based anomaly detection. This paper investigates different variations of diffusion modeling for unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection. In particular, we find that Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (DDPM) are performant on anomaly detection benchmarks yet computationally expensive. By simplifying DDPM in application to anomaly detection, we are naturally led to an alternative approach called Diffusion Time Estimation (DTE). DTE estimates the distribution over diffusion time for a given input and uses the mode or mean of this distribution as the anomaly score. We derive an analytical form for this density and leverage a deep neural network to improve inference efficiency. Through empirical evaluations on the ADBench benchmark, we demonstrate that all diffusion-based anomaly detection methods perform competitively for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Notably, DTE achieves orders of magnitude faster inference time than DDPM, while outperforming it on this benchmark. These results establish diffusion-based anomaly detection as a scalable alternative to traditional methods and recent deep-learning techniques for standard unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Swift Hydra: Self-Reinforcing Generative Framework for Anomaly Detection with Multiple Mamba Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06413v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite a plethora of anomaly detection models developed over the years, their ability to generalize to unseen anomalies remains an issue, particularly in critical systems. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing Swift Hydra, a new framework for training an anomaly detection method based on generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL). Through featuring an RL policy that operates on the latent variables of a generative model, the framework synthesizes novel and diverse anomaly samples that are capable of bypassing a detection model. These generated synthetic samples are, in turn, used to augment the detection model, further improving its ability to handle challenging anomalies. Swift Hydra also incorporates Mamba models structured as a Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enable scalable adaptation of the number of Mamba experts based on data complexity, effectively capturing diverse feature distributions without increasing the model's inference time. Empirical evaluations on ADBench benchmark demonstrate that Swift Hydra outperforms other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models while maintaining a relatively short inference time. From these results, our research highlights a new and auspicious paradigm of integrating RL and generative AI for advancing anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Risk-Based Thresholding for Reliable Anomaly Detection in Concentrated Solar Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19146v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and reliable operation of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants is essential for meeting the growing demand for sustainable energy. However, high-temperature solar receivers face severe operational risks, such as freezing, deformation, and corrosion, resulting in costly downtime and maintenance. To monitor CSP plants, cameras mounted on solar receivers record infrared images at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes throughout the day. Anomalous images can be detected by thresholding an anomaly score, where the threshold is chosen to optimize metrics such as the F1-score on a validation set. This work proposes a framework for generating more reliable decision thresholds with finite-sample coverage guarantees on any chosen risk function. Our framework also incorporates an abstention mechanism, allowing high-risk predictions to be deferred to domain experts. Second, we propose a density forecasting method to estimate the likelihood of an observed image given a sequence of previously observed images, using this likelihood as its anomaly score. Third, we analyze the deployment results of our framework across multiple training scenarios over several months for two CSP plants. This analysis provides valuable insights to our industry partner for optimizing maintenance operations. Finally, given the confidential nature of our dataset, we provide an extended simulated dataset, leveraging recent advancements in generative modeling to create diverse thermal images that simulate multiple CSP plants. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[VANE-Bench: Video Anomaly Evaluation Benchmark for Conversational LMMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10326v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent developments in Large Multi-modal Video Models (Video-LMMs) have significantly enhanced our ability to interpret and analyze video data. Despite their impressive capabilities, current Video-LMMs have not been evaluated for anomaly detection tasks, which is critical to their deployment in practical scenarios e.g., towards identifying deepfakes, manipulated video content, traffic accidents and crimes. In this paper, we introduce VANE-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the proficiency of Video-LMMs in detecting and localizing anomalies and inconsistencies in videos. Our dataset comprises an array of videos synthetically generated using existing state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, encompassing a variety of subtle anomalies and inconsistencies grouped into five categories: unnatural transformations, unnatural appearance, pass-through, disappearance and sudden appearance. Additionally, our benchmark features real-world samples from existing anomaly detection datasets, focusing on crime-related irregularities, atypical pedestrian behavior, and unusual events. The task is structured as a visual question-answering challenge to gauge the models' ability to accurately detect and localize the anomalies within the videos. We evaluate nine existing Video-LMMs, both open and closed sources, on this benchmarking task and find that most of the models encounter difficulties in effectively identifying the subtle anomalies. In conclusion, our research offers significant insights into the current capabilities of Video-LMMs in the realm of anomaly detection, highlighting the importance of our work in evaluating and improving these models for real-world applications.

| **[Anomaly Detection Using Computer Vision: A Comparative Analysis of Class Distinction and Performance Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19100v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper showcases an experimental study on anomaly detection using computer vision. The study focuses on class distinction and performance evaluation, combining OpenCV with deep learning techniques while employing a TensorFlow-based convolutional neural network for real-time face recognition and classification. The system effectively distinguishes among three classes: authorized personnel (admin), intruders, and non-human entities. A MobileNetV2-based deep learning model is utilized to optimize real-time performance, ensuring high computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Extensive dataset preprocessing, including image augmentation and normalization, enhances the models generalization capabilities. Our analysis demonstrates classification accuracies of 90.20% for admin, 98.60% for intruders, and 75.80% for non-human detection, while maintaining an average processing rate of 30 frames per second. The study leverages transfer learning, batch normalization, and Adam optimization to achieve stable and robust learning, and a comparative analysis of class differentiation strategies highlights the impact of feature extraction techniques and training methodologies. The results indicate that advanced feature selection and data augmentation significantly enhance detection performance, particularly in distinguishing human from non-human scenes. As an experimental study, this research provides critical insights into optimizing deep learning-based surveillance systems for high-security environments and improving the accuracy and efficiency of real-time anomaly detection.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[CRCL: Causal Representation Consistency Learning for Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18808v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) remains a fundamental yet formidable task in the video understanding community, with promising applications in areas such as information forensics and public safety protection. Due to the rarity and diversity of anomalies, existing methods only use easily collected regular events to model the inherent normality of normal spatial-temporal patterns in an unsupervised manner. Previous studies have shown that existing unsupervised VAD models are incapable of label-independent data offsets (e.g., scene changes) in real-world scenarios and may fail to respond to light anomalies due to the overgeneralization of deep neural networks. Inspired by causality learning, we argue that there exist causal factors that can adequately generalize the prototypical patterns of regular events and present significant deviations when anomalous instances occur. In this regard, we propose Causal Representation Consistency Learning (CRCL) to implicitly mine potential scene-robust causal variable in unsupervised video normality learning. Specifically, building on the structural causal models, we propose scene-debiasing learning and causality-inspired normality learning to strip away entangled scene bias in deep representations and learn causal video normality, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over conventional deep representation learning. Moreover, ablation studies and extension validation show that the CRCL can cope with label-independent biases in multi-scene settings and maintain stable performance with only limited training data available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> | None |
| **[Large Language Models for Blockchain Security: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14280v5)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools across various domains within cyber security. Notably, recent studies are increasingly exploring LLMs applied to the context of blockchain security (BS). However, there remains a gap in a comprehensive understanding regarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of LLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we undertake a literature review focusing on the studies that apply LLMs in blockchain security (LLM4BS). Our study aims to comprehensively analyze and understand existing research, and elucidate how LLMs contribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough examination of existing literature, we delve into the integration of LLMs into various aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which LLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart contract auditing, transaction anomaly detection, vulnerability repair, program analysis of smart contracts, and serving as participants in the cryptocurrency community. Furthermore, we assess the challenges and limitations associated with leveraging LLMs for enhancing blockchain security, considering factors such as scalability, privacy concerns, and ethical concerns. Our thorough review sheds light on the opportunities and potential risks of tasks on LLM4BS, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RoCA: Robust Contrastive One-class Time Series Anomaly Detection with Contaminated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18385v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accumulation of time-series signals and the absence of labels make time-series Anomaly Detection (AD) a self-supervised task of deep learning. Methods based on normality assumptions face the following three limitations: (1) A single assumption could hardly characterize the whole normality or lead to some deviation. (2) Some assumptions may go against the principle of AD. (3) Their basic assumption is that the training data is uncontaminated (free of anomalies), which is unrealistic in practice, leading to a decline in robustness. This paper proposes a novel robust approach, RoCA, which is the first to address all of the above three challenges, as far as we are aware. It fuses the separated assumptions of one-class classification and contrastive learning in a single training process to characterize a more complete so-called normality. Additionally, it monitors the training data and computes a carefully designed anomaly score throughout the training process. This score helps identify latent anomalies, which are then used to define the classification boundary, inspired by the concept of outlier exposure. The performance on AIOps datasets improved by 6% compared to when contamination was not considered (COCA). On two large and high-dimensional multivariate datasets, the performance increased by 5% to 10%. RoCA achieves the highest average performance on both univariate and multivariate datasets.

| **[Towards Training-free Anomaly Detection with Vision and Language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18325v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is valuable for real-world applications, such as industrial quality inspection. However, most approaches focus on detecting local structural anomalies while neglecting compositional anomalies incorporating logical constraints. In this paper, we introduce LogSAD, a novel multi-modal framework that requires no training for both Logical and Structural Anomaly Detection. First, we propose a match-of-thought architecture that employs advanced large multi-modal models (i.e. GPT-4V) to generate matching proposals, formulating interests and compositional rules of thought for anomaly detection. Second, we elaborate on multi-granularity anomaly detection, consisting of patch tokens, sets of interests, and composition matching with vision and language foundation models. Subsequently, we present a calibration module to align anomaly scores from different detectors, followed by integration strategies for the final decision. Consequently, our approach addresses both logical and structural anomaly detection within a unified framework and achieves state-of-the-art results without the need for training, even when compared to supervised approaches, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness.

| **[Knowledge Transfer from LLMs to Provenance Analysis: A Semantic-Augmented Method for APT Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18316v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have caused significant losses across a wide range of sectors, including the theft of sensitive data and harm to system integrity. As attack techniques grow increasingly sophisticated and stealthy, the arms race between cyber defenders and attackers continues to intensify. The revolutionary impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up numerous opportunities in various fields, including cybersecurity. An intriguing question arises: can the extensive knowledge embedded in LLMs be harnessed for provenance analysis and play a positive role in identifying previously unknown malicious events? To seek a deeper understanding of this issue, we propose a new strategy for taking advantage of LLMs in provenance-based threat detection. In our design, the state-of-the-art LLM offers additional details in provenance data interpretation, leveraging their knowledge of system calls, software identity, and high-level understanding of application execution context. The advanced contextualized embedding capability is further utilized to capture the rich semantics of event descriptions. We comprehensively examine the quality of the resulting embeddings, and it turns out that they offer promising avenues. Subsequently, machine learning models built upon these embeddings demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world data. In our evaluation, supervised threat detection achieves a precision of 99.0%, and semi-supervised anomaly detection attains a precision of 96.9%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10080v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). By leveraging auxiliary data during training, these models can directly perform cross-category anomaly detection on target datasets, such as detecting defects on industrial product surfaces or identifying tumors in organ tissues. Existing approaches typically construct text prompts through either manual design or the optimization of learnable prompt vectors. However, these methods face several challenges: 1) handcrafted prompts require extensive expert knowledge and trial-and-error; 2) single-form learnable prompts struggle to capture complex anomaly semantics; and 3) an unconstrained prompt space limits generalization to unseen categories. To address these issues, we propose Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning (Bayes-PFL), which models the prompt space as a learnable probability distribution from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, a prompt flow module is designed to learn both image-specific and image-agnostic distributions, which are jointly utilized to regularize the text prompt space and improve the model's generalization on unseen categories. These learned distributions are then sampled to generate diverse text prompts, effectively covering the prompt space. Additionally, a residual cross-model attention (RCA) module is introduced to better align dynamic text embeddings with fine-grained image features. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical datasets demonstrate our method's superior performance. The code is available at https://github.com/xiaozhen228/Bayes-PFL.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/xiaozhen228/Bayes-PFL) |
| **[Anomize: Better Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18094v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection (OVVAD) seeks to detect and classify both base and novel anomalies. However, existing methods face two specific challenges related to novel anomalies. The first challenge is detection ambiguity, where the model struggles to assign accurate anomaly scores to unfamiliar anomalies. The second challenge is categorization confusion, where novel anomalies are often misclassified as visually similar base instances. To address these challenges, we explore supplementary information from multiple sources to mitigate detection ambiguity by leveraging multiple levels of visual data alongside matching textual information. Furthermore, we propose incorporating label relations to guide the encoding of new labels, thereby improving alignment between novel videos and their corresponding labels, which helps reduce categorization confusion. The resulting Anomize framework effectively tackles these issues, achieving superior performance on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in OVVAD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Anomaly Detection and Localization for Speech Deepfakes via Feature Pyramid Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18032v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI-driven generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic speech deepfakes - synthetic audio signals that can imitate target speakers' voices - raising critical security concerns. Existing methods for detecting speech deepfakes primarily rely on supervised learning, which suffers from two critical limitations: limited generalization to unseen synthesis techniques and a lack of explainability. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing a novel interpretable one-class detection framework, which reframes speech deepfake detection as an anomaly detection task. Our model is trained exclusively on real speech to characterize its distribution, enabling the classification of out-of-distribution samples as synthetically generated. Additionally, our framework produces interpretable anomaly maps during inference, highlighting anomalous regions across both time and frequency domains. This is done through a Student-Teacher Feature Pyramid Matching system, enhanced with Discrepancy Scaling to improve generalization capabilities across unseen data distributions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to the considered baselines, validating the effectiveness of framing speech deepfake detection as an anomaly detection problem.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often struggle to capture the long-range dependencies efficiently and neglect the spectral information. Recently, selective State Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable advantages in capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity and a selection mechanism. Motivated by their success across various domains, we propose GLADMamba, a novel framework that adapts the selective state space model into UGLAD field. We design View-Fused Mamba (VFM) with a Mamba-Transformer-style architecture to efficiently fuse information from different views with a selective state mechanism. We also design Spectrum-Guided Mamba (SGM) with a Mamba-Transformer-style architecture to leverage the Rayleigh quotient to guide the embedding refining process. GLADMamba can dynamically focus on anomaly-related information while discarding irrelevant information for anomaly detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce Mamba and explicit spectral information to UGLAD. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that GLADMamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in UGLAD.

In this work, we assess the applicability and utility of an AI-based model for brain aneurysm detection comparing the performance of two readers with different levels of experience (2 and 13 years). We aim to answer the following questions: 1) Do the readers improve their performance when assisted by the AI algorithm? 2) How much does the AI algorithm impact routine clinical workflow? We reuse and enlarge our open-access, Time-Of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography dataset (N=460). We use 360 subjects for training/validating our algorithm and 100 as unseen test set for the reading session. Even though our model reaches state-of-the-art results on the test set (sensitivity=74%, false positive rate=1.6), we show that neither the junior nor the senior reader significantly increase their sensitivity (p=0.59, p=1, respectively). In addition, we find that reading time for both readers is significantly higher in the "AI-assisted" setting than in the "Unassisted" (+15 seconds, on average; p=3x10^(-4) junior, p=3x10^(-5) senior). The confidence reported by the readers is unchanged across the two settings, indicating that the AI assistance does not influence the certainty of the diagnosis. Our findings highlight the importance of clinical validation of AI algorithms in a clinical setting involving radiologists. This study should serve as a reminder to the community to always examine the real-word effectiveness and workflow impact of proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper under review with a Journal in the medical imaging field</p></details> | None |

Unlike traditional AD benchmarks with fixed anomaly criteria, our task detects anomalies specific to each scene by inferring a reference group of regular objects. To address occlusions, we use multiple views of each scene as input, construct 3D object-centric models for each instance from 2D views, enhancing these models with geometrically consistent part-aware representations. Anomalous objects are then detected through cross-instance comparison. We also introduce two new benchmarks, ToysAD-8K and PartsAD-15K as testbeds for future research in this task. We provide a comprehensive analysis of our method quantitatively and qualitatively on these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025.

| **[Bayesian generative models can flag performance loss, bias, and out-of-distribution image content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17477v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models are popular for medical imaging tasks such as anomaly detection, feature extraction, data visualization, or image generation. Since they are parameterized by deep learning models, they are often sensitive to distribution shifts and unreliable when applied to out-of-distribution data, creating a risk of, e.g. underrepresentation bias. This behavior can be flagged using uncertainty quantification methods for generative models, but their availability remains limited. We propose SLUG: A new UQ method for VAEs that combines recent advances in Laplace approximations with stochastic trace estimators to scale gracefully with image dimensionality. We show that our UQ score -- unlike the VAE's encoder variances -- correlates strongly with reconstruction error and racial underrepresentation bias for dermatological images. We also show how pixel-wise uncertainty can detect out-of-distribution image content such as ink, rulers, and patches, which is known to induce learning shortcuts in predictive models.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[CausalRivers -- Scaling up benchmarking of causal discovery for real-world time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17452v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery, or identifying causal relationships from observational data, is a notoriously challenging task, with numerous methods proposed to tackle it. Despite this, in-the-wild evaluation of these methods is still lacking, as works frequently rely on synthetic data evaluation and sparse real-world examples under critical theoretical assumptions. Real-world causal structures, however, are often complex, making it hard to decide on a proper causal discovery strategy. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalRivers, the largest in-the-wild causal discovery benchmarking kit for time-series data to date. CausalRivers features an extensive dataset on river discharge that covers the eastern German territory (666 measurement stations) and the state of Bavaria (494 measurement stations). It spans the years 2019 to 2023 with a 15-minute temporal resolution. Further, we provide additional data from a flood around the Elbe River, as an event with a pronounced distributional shift. Leveraging multiple sources of information and time-series meta-data, we constructed two distinct causal ground truth graphs (Bavaria and eastern Germany). These graphs can be sampled to generate thousands of subgraphs to benchmark causal discovery across diverse and challenging settings. To demonstrate the utility of CausalRivers, we evaluate several causal discovery approaches through a set of experiments to identify areas for improvement. CausalRivers has the potential to facilitate robust evaluations and comparisons of causal discovery methods. Besides this primary purpose, we also expect that this dataset will be relevant for connected areas of research, such as time-series forecasting and anomaly detection. Based on this, we hope to push benchmark-driven method development that fosters advanced techniques for causal discovery, as is the case for many other areas of machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, ICLR2025 main track</p></details> | None |

While pretrained time series foundation models are gaining popularity, they face the following challenges: (1) Unlike natural language tasks, time series data vary in frequency, channel numbers, historical/prediction lengths. For long-term forecasting tasks in particular, tailored fine-tuning can significantly enhance performance.(2) Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA remain applicable but require adaptation to temporal characteristics. To address these challenges, our TRACE framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Gated DSIC (Gated Dynamic Simulation Importance Calculation), an unbiased LoRA module importance selection mechanism that ensures conditional parameter consistency before and after masking. Experiments demonstrate that Gated DSIC outperforms common fine-tuning. (2) Reconstructed prediction heads for long-term forecasting tasks, which achieve comparable or superior performance to linear probing heads while drastically reducing parameter counts. Extensive experiments on long-/short-term forecasting and anomaly detection tasks across diverse datasets, coupled with ablation studies, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Survey on RGB, 3D, and Multimodal Approaches for Unsupervised Industrial Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21982v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the advancement of industrial informatization, unsupervised anomaly detection technology effectively overcomes the scarcity of abnormal samples and significantly enhances the automation and reliability of smart manufacturing. As an important branch, industrial image anomaly detection focuses on automatically identifying visual anomalies in industrial scenarios (such as product surface defects, assembly errors, and equipment appearance anomalies) through computer vision techniques. With the rapid development of Unsupervised industrial Image Anomaly Detection (UIAD), excellent detection performance has been achieved not only in RGB setting but also in 3D and multimodal (RGB and 3D) settings. However, existing surveys primarily focus on UIAD tasks in RGB setting, with little discussion in 3D and multimodal settings. To address this gap, this artical provides a comprehensive review of UIAD tasks in the three modal settings. Specifically, we first introduce the task concept and process of UIAD. We then overview the research on UIAD in three modal settings (RGB, 3D, and multimodal), including datasets and methods, and review multimodal feature fusion strategies in multimodal setting. Finally, we summarize the main challenges faced by UIAD tasks in the three modal settings, and offer insights into future development directions, aiming to provide researchers with a comprehensive reference and offer new perspectives for the advancement of industrial informatization.

However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies.

While existing research has examined individual models, systematic comparisons of VLMs' visualization literacy remain unexplored. We bridge this gap through a rigorous, first-of-its-kind evaluation of four leading VLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama) using standardized assessments: the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) and Critical Thinking Assessment for Literacy in Visualizations (CALVI). Our methodology uniquely combines randomized trials with structured prompting techniques to control for order effects and response variability - a critical consideration overlooked in many VLM evaluations. Our analysis reveals that while specific models demonstrate competence in basic chart interpretation (Claude achieving 67.9% accuracy on VLAT), all models exhibit substantial difficulties in identifying misleading visualization elements (maximum 30.0\% accuracy on CALVI). We uncover distinct performance patterns: strong capabilities in interpreting conventional charts like line charts (76-96% accuracy) and detecting hierarchical structures (80-100% accuracy), but consistent difficulties with data-dense visualizations involving multiple encodings (bubble charts: 18.6-61.4%) and anomaly detection (25-30% accuracy). Significantly, we observe distinct uncertainty management behavior across models, with Gemini displaying heightened caution (22.5% question omission) compared to others (7-8%). These findings provide crucial insights for the visualization community by establishing reliable VLM evaluation benchmarks, identifying areas where current models fall short, and highlighting the need for targeted improvements in VLM architectures for visualization tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the importance of practices that capture performance regressions early, there is a lack of publicly available datasets that comprehensively capture real-world performance measurements, expert-validated alerts, and associated metadata such as bugs and testing conditions. To address this gap, we introduce a unique dataset to support various research studies in performance engineering, anomaly detection, and machine learning. This dataset was collected from Mozilla Firefox's performance testing infrastructure and comprises 5,655 performance time series, 17,989 performance alerts, and detailed annotations of resulting bugs collected from May 2023 to May 2024.

Models performing image-related tasks, e.g. detection, and classification, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can degrade their performance and produce undesirable outcomes. This paper introduces a novel technique for anomaly detection in images called 2DSig-Detect, which uses a 2D-signature-embedded semi-supervised framework rooted in rough path theory. We demonstrate our method in adversarial settings for training-time and test-time attacks, and benchmark our framework against other state of the art methods. Using 2DSig-Detect for anomaly detection, we show both superior performance and a reduction in the computation time to detect the presence of adversarial perturbations in images.</p></details> |  | None |

Research on anomaly detection approaches is constrained by the availability of datasets that represent complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical to industrial processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of the methods' applicability to real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. In addition to the evaluation of defect detection performance of recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training approach, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Even small amounts of injected real defects prove beneficial for model generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Research findings indicate that supervision by means of both synthetic and accumulated real defects can complement each other, meeting demanded industrial inspection requirements such as low false positive rates and high recall. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures, this preprint has been submitted to the Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, the dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14911043</p></details> | None |

The ever-increasing sensorization of manufacturing lines makes processes more observable, but also poses the challenge of continuously analyzing vast amounts of multivariate time series data. These challenges include data quality since data may contain noise, be unlabeled or even mislabeled. A promising approach consists of combining an embedding model with other Machine Learning algorithms to enhance the overall performance in detecting anomalies. Moreover, representing time series as vectors brings many advantages like higher flexibility and improved ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. We tested our solution in a real industrial use case, using data collected from a Bonfiglioli plant. The results demonstrate that, unlike traditional reconstruction-based autoencoders, which often struggle in the presence of sporadic noise, our embedding-based framework maintains high performance across various noise conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions. Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures | None |

Network analysis has emerged as a valuable approach in this context. In this paper, we present WeirdFlows, a top-down search pipeline for detecting potentially fraudulent transactions and non-compliant agents. In a transaction network, fraud attempts are often based on complex transaction patterns that change over time to avoid detection. The WeirdFlows pipeline requires neither an a priori set of patterns nor a training set. In addition, by providing elements to explain the anomalies found, it facilitates and supports the work of an AFC analyst. We evaluate WeirdFlows on a dataset from Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP) bank, comprising 80 million cross-country transactions over 15 months, benchmarking our implementation of the algorithm. The results, corroborated by ISP AFC experts, highlight its effectiveness in identifying suspicious transactions and actors, particularly in the context of the economic sanctions imposed in the EU after February 2022. This demonstrates \textit{WeirdFlows}' capability to handle large datasets, detect complex transaction patterns, and provide the necessary interpretability for formal AFC investigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, ITADATA2024</p></details> | None |

However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module.

Existing KD-based methods for multimodal AD that use fused multimodal features to obtain teacher representations face challenges. Anomalies in one modality may not be effectively captured in the fused teacher features, leading to detection failures. Besides, these methods do not fully leverage the rich intra- and inter-modality information. In this paper, we propose Crossmodal Reverse Distillation (CRD) based on Multi-branch design to realize Multimodal Industrial AD. By assigning independent branches to each modality, our method enables finer detection of anomalies within each modality. Furthermore, we enhance the interaction between modalities during the distillation process by designing Crossmodal Filter and Amplifier. With the idea of crossmodal mapping, the student network is allowed to better learn normal features while anomalies in all modalities are ensured to be effectively detected. Experimental verifications on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal anomaly detection and localization.</p></details> |  | None |

At its core, human-centric VAD faces substantial challenges, such as the complexity of diverse human behaviors, the rarity of anomalies, and ethical constraints. These challenges limit access to high-quality datasets and highlight the need for a dataset and framework supporting continual learning. Moving towards adaptive human-centric VAD, we introduce the HuVAD (Human-centric privacy-enhanced Video Anomaly Detection) dataset and a novel Unsupervised Continual Anomaly Learning (UCAL) framework. UCAL enables incremental learning, allowing models to adapt over time, bridging traditional training and real-world deployment. HuVAD prioritizes privacy by providing de-identified annotations and includes seven indoor/outdoor scenes, offering over 5x more pose-annotated frames than previous datasets. Our standard and continual benchmarks, utilize a comprehensive set of metrics, demonstrating that UCAL-enhanced models achieve superior performance in 82.14% of cases, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Existing approaches attempt optimization individually but struggle to balance reduced overhead with performance. This paper presents an adaptive FL framework combining batch size optimization, client selection, and asynchronous updates for efficient anomaly detection. Using UNSW-NB15 for general network traffic and ROAD for automotive networks, our framework reduces communication overhead by 97.6% (700.0s to 16.8s) while maintaining comparable accuracy (95.10% vs. 95.12%). The Mann-Whitney U test confirms significant improvements (p < 0.05).

This work proposes a novel framework that combines post-hoc explanations with semi-supervised learning to automatically identify anomalous explanations that deviate from those of correctly classified images and may therefore indicate model abnormal behaviors. This significantly reduces the workload for maintenance decision-makers, who only need to manually reclassify images flagged as having anomalous explanations. The proposed framework is applied to drone-collected images of insulator shells for power grid infrastructure monitoring, considering two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), GradCAM explanations and Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection. The average classification accuracy on two faulty classes is improved by 8% and maintenance operators are required to manually reclassify only 15% of the images. We compare the proposed framework with a state-of-the-art approach based on the faithfulness metric: the experimental results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves F_1 scores larger than those of the faithfulness-based approach. Additionally, the proposed framework successfully identifies correct classifications that result from non-causal shortcuts, such as the presence of ID tags printed on insulator shells.</p></details> |  | None |

However, ensuring robustness under unseen domain shifts such as lighting variations or sensor drift remains a significant challenge. Existing methods attempt to address domain shifts by training generalizable models but often rely on prior knowledge of target distributions and can hardly generalise to backbones designed for other data modalities. To overcome these limitations, we build upon memory-bank-based anomaly detection methods, optimizing a robust Sinkhorn distance on limited target training data to enhance generalization to unseen target domains. We evaluate the effectiveness on both 2D and 3D anomaly detection benchmarks with simulated distribution shifts. Our proposed method demonstrates superior results compared with state-of-the-art anomaly detection and domain adaptation methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, obtaining a comprehensive, multi-plane annotated fetal US dataset remains challenging, particularly for rare or complex anomalies owing to their low incidence and numerous subtypes. This poses difficulties in training novice radiologists and developing robust AI models, especially for detecting abnormal fetuses. In this study, we introduce a Flexible Fetal US image generation framework (FetalFlex) to address these challenges, which leverages anatomical structures and multimodal information to enable controllable synthesis of fetal US images across diverse planes. Specifically, FetalFlex incorporates a pre-alignment module to enhance controllability and introduces a repaint strategy to ensure consistent texture and appearance. Moreover, a two-stage adaptive sampling strategy is developed to progressively refine image quality from coarse to fine levels. We believe that FetalFlex is the first method capable of generating both in-distribution normal and out-of-distribution abnormal fetal US images, without requiring any abnormal data. Experiments on multi-center datasets demonstrate that FetalFlex achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple image quality metrics. A reader study further confirms the close alignment of the generated results with expert visual assessments. Furthermore, synthetic images by FetalFlex significantly improve the performance of six typical deep models in downstream classification and anomaly detection tasks. Lastly, FetalFlex's anatomy-level controllable generation offers a unique advantage for anomaly simulation and creating paired or counterfactual data at the pixel level.

Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12245</p></details> | None |

Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and ``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of ``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model. For continual anomaly detection, ours achieves first place in 17/18 settings on MVTec and VisA.

With the advancement of machine learning (ML) algorithms and the accumulation of naturalistic driving data, many ML models have been adopted for abnormal driving behavior detection (also referred to in this paper as "anomalies"). Most existing ML-based detectors rely on (fully) supervised ML methods, which require substantial labeled data. However, ground truth labels are not always available in the real world, and labeling large amounts of data is tedious. Thus, there is a need to explore unsupervised or semi-supervised methods to make the anomaly detection process more feasible and efficient. To fill this research gap, this study analyzes large-scale real-world data revealing several abnormal driving behaviors (e.g., sudden acceleration, rapid lane-changing) and develops a hierarchical extreme learning machine (HELM)-based semi-supervised ML method using partly labeled data to detect the identified abnormal driving behaviors. Moreover, previous ML-based approaches predominantly utilized basic vehicle motion features (such as velocity and acceleration) to label and detect abnormal driving behaviors, while this study seeks to introduce event-level safety indicators as input features for ML models to improve detection performance. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised ML model with the introduced safety indicators serving as important features. The proposed semi-supervised ML method outperforms other baseline semi-supervised or unsupervised methods: for example, it delivers the best accuracy at 99.58% and the best F1-score at 0.9913. The ablation study further highlights the significance of safety indicators for advancing the detection performance of abnormal driving behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, accepted by the 103rd Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting, accepted and published by Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board</p></details> | None |
| **[EIAD: Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Via Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14162v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical to ensure product quality during manufacturing. Although existing zero-shot defect segmentation and detection methods have shown effectiveness, they cannot provide detailed descriptions of the defects. Furthermore, the application of large multi-modal models in IAD remains in its infancy, facing challenges in balancing question-answering (QA) performance and mask-based grounding capabilities, often owing to overfitting during the fine-tuning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that introduces a dedicated multi-modal defect localization module to decouple the dialog functionality from the core feature extraction. This decoupling is achieved through independent optimization objectives and tailored learning strategies. Additionally, we contribute to the first multi-modal industrial anomaly detection training dataset, named Defect Detection Question Answering (DDQA), encompassing a wide range of defect types and industrial scenarios. Unlike conventional datasets that rely on GPT-generated data, DDQA ensures authenticity and reliability and offers a robust foundation for model training. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection Assistant (EIAD), achieves outstanding performance in defect detection and localization tasks.

| **[Enhancing Kubernetes Resilience through Anomaly Detection and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14114v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kubernetes, in recent years, has become widely used for the deployment and management of software projects on cloud infrastructure. Due to the execution of these applications across numerous Nodes, each one with its unique specifications, it has become a challenge to identify problems and ensure the smooth operation of the application. Effective supervision of the cluster remains a challenging and resource intensive task. This research work focuses on providing a novel framework system maintainer in order to overview all the possible resources in Kubernetes and pay the attention to specific parts of the cluster that may be showcasing problematic behavior. The novelty of this component rises from the use of cluster graphical representation where features, e.g. graph edges and neighboring nodes, are used for anomaly detection. The proposed framework defines the normality in the dynamic enviroment of Kubernetes and the output feeds the supervised models for abnormaliry detection presented in user-friendly graph interface. A variety of model combinations are evaluated and tested in real-life environment.</p></details> | 27 pages, 21 Figures | None |
| **[Scale-Aware Contrastive Reverse Distillation for Unsupervised Medical Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13828v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection using deep learning has garnered significant research attention due to its broad applicability, particularly in medical imaging where labeled anomalous data are scarce. While earlier approaches leverage generative models like autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), they often fall short due to overgeneralization. Recent methods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows, self-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance discrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse distillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to derive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring out-of-normal distributions. Further, we design a scale adaptation mechanism to softly weight contrastive distillation losses at different scales to account for the scale variation issue. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed method.

Differential Privacy (DP), which introduces mathematically controlled noise, provides a balance between data utility and privacy. However, black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) models often obscure how this noise impacts model accuracy, complicating the optimization of privacy-accuracy trade-offs. This study introduces the Differential Privacy-Hyperdimensional Computing (DP-HD) framework, a novel approach combining Explainable AI (XAI) and vector symbolic paradigms to quantify and predict noise effects on accuracy using a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) metric. DP-HD enables precise tuning of DP noise levels, ensuring an optimal balance between privacy and performance. The framework has been validated using real-world AM data, demonstrating its applicability to industrial environments. Experimental results demonstrate DP-HD's capability to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (94.43%) with robust privacy protections in anomaly detection for AM, even under significant noise conditions. Beyond AM, DP-HD holds substantial promise for broader applications in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, financial services, and government data management, where securing sensitive data while maintaining high ML performance is paramount.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures | None |

However, current clinical diagnoses primarily rely on manual evaluation. Deep learning methods have shown promise in lesion detection, but most supervised approaches are heavily dependent on large, annotated datasets. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) offers a compelling alternative by eliminating the need for abnormal data annotations. However, existing UAD methods rely on curated normal datasets and their performance frequently deteriorates when applied to clinical datasets due to domain shifts. We propose an Uncertainty-based Unsupervised Anomaly Detection framework, termed U2AD, to address these limitations. Unlike traditional methods, U2AD is designed to be trained and tested within the same clinical dataset, following a "mask-and-reconstruction" paradigm built on a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We introduce an uncertainty-guided masking strategy to resolve task conflicts between normal reconstruction and anomaly detection to achieve an optimal balance. Specifically, we employ a Monte-Carlo sampling technique to estimate reconstruction uncertainty mappings during training. By iteratively optimizing reconstruction training under the guidance of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, U2AD reduces overall reconstruction variance while emphasizing regions. Experimental results demonstrate that U2AD outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised methods in patient-level identification and segment-level localization tasks. This framework establishes a new benchmark for incorporating uncertainty guidance into UAD, highlighting its clinical utility in addressing domain shifts and task conflicts in medical image anomaly detection.

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  | None |

As datasets become more complex and high-dimensional, traditional detection methods struggle to effectively capture intricate patterns. Advances in deep learning have made AD methods more powerful and adaptable, improving their ability to handle high-dimensional and unstructured data. This survey provides a comprehensive review of over 180 recent studies, focusing on deep learning-based AD techniques. We categorize and analyze these methods into reconstruction-based and prediction-based approaches, highlighting their effectiveness in modeling complex data distributions. Additionally, we explore the integration of traditional and deep learning methods, highlighting how hybrid approaches combine the interpretability of traditional techniques with the flexibility of deep learning to enhance detection accuracy and model transparency. Finally, we identify open issues and propose future research directions to advance the field of AD. This review bridges gaps in existing literature and serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance AD techniques using deep learning.</p></details> |  | None |

We summarize the main reasons for this gap into two aspects. On one hand, general-purpose LMMs lack cognition of defects in the visual modality, thereby failing to sufficiently focus on defect areas. Therefore, we propose to modify the AnyRes structure of the LLaVA model, providing the potential anomalous areas identified by existing IAD models to the LMMs. On the other hand, existing methods mainly focus on identifying defects by learning defect patterns or comparing with normal samples, yet they fall short of understanding the causes of these defects. Considering that the generation of defects is closely related to the manufacturing process, we propose a manufacturing-driven IAD paradigm. An instruction-tuning dataset for IAD (InstructIAD) and a data organization approach for Chain-of-Thought with manufacturing (CoT-M) are designed to leverage the manufacturing process for IAD. Based on the above two modifications, we present Triad, a novel LMM-based method incorporating an expert-guided region-of-interest tokenizer and manufacturing process for industrial anomaly detection. Extensive experiments show that our Triad not only demonstrates competitive performance against current LMMs but also achieves further improved accuracy when equipped with manufacturing processes.

| **[Language-guided Open-world Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13160v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection models aim to detect anomalies that deviate from what is expected. In open-world scenarios, the expected events may change as requirements change. For example, not wearing a mask is considered abnormal during a flu outbreak but normal otherwise. However, existing methods assume that the definition of anomalies is invariable, and thus are not applicable to the open world. To address this, we propose a novel open-world VAD paradigm with variable definitions, allowing guided detection through user-provided natural language at inference time. This paradigm necessitates establishing a robust mapping from video and textual definition to anomaly score. Therefore, we propose LaGoVAD (Language-guided Open-world VAD), a model that dynamically adapts anomaly definitions through two regularization strategies: diversifying the relative durations of anomalies via dynamic video synthesis, and enhancing feature robustness through contrastive learning with negative mining. Training such adaptable models requires diverse anomaly definitions, but existing datasets typically provide given labels without semantic descriptions. To bridge this gap, we collect PreVAD (Pre-training Video Anomaly Dataset), the largest and most diverse video anomaly dataset to date, featuring 35,279 annotated videos with multi-level category labels and descriptions that explicitly define anomalies. Zero-shot experiments on seven datasets demonstrate SOTA performance. Data and code will be released.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing ZSAD methods struggle with the boundary of small and complex defects due to insufficient representations. Most of them use the single manually designed prompts, failing to work for diverse objects and anomalies. In this paper, we propose MFP-CLIP, a novel prompt-based CLIP framework which explores the efficacy of multi-form prompts for zero-shot industrial anomaly detection. We employ an image to text prompting(I2TP) mechanism to better represent the object in the image. MFP-CLIP enhances perception to multi-scale and complex anomalies by self prompting(SP) and a multi-patch feature aggregation(MPFA) module. To precisely localize defects, we introduce the mask prompting(MP) module to guide model to focus on potential anomaly regions. Extensive experiments are conducted on two wildly used industrial anomaly detection benchmarks, MVTecAD and VisA, demonstrating MFP-CLIP's superiority in ZSAD.</p></details> |  | None |

To enhance model's anomaly recognition ability, previous works have typically involved RGB, optical flow, and text features. Recently, dynamic vision sensors (DVS) have emerged as a promising technology, which capture visual information as discrete events with a very high dynamic range and temporal resolution. It reduces data redundancy and enhances the capture capacity of moving objects compared to conventional camera. To introduce this rich dynamic information into the surveillance field, we created the first DVS video anomaly detection benchmark, namely UCF-Crime-DVS. To fully utilize this new data modality, a multi-scale spiking fusion network (MSF) is designed based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). This work explores the potential application of dynamic information from event data in video anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on UCF-Crime-DVS and its superior performance compared to other models, establishing a new baseline for SNN-based weakly supervised video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> | None |

Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study.

This study aims to enforce robust cybersecurity constraints to mitigate the risks associated with data breaches, transaction fraud, and system manipulation. The background focuses on the rise of LLM-driven robotic systems in e-commerce, finance, and service industries, alongside the vulnerabilities they introduce. A novel security architecture combining blockchain technology with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and real-time anomaly detection was implemented to safeguard transactions. Key performance metrics such as transaction integrity, response time, and breach detection accuracy were evaluated, showing improved security and system performance. The results highlight that the proposed architecture reduced fraudulent transactions by 90%, improved breach detection accuracy to 98%, and ensured secure transaction validation within a latency of 0.05 seconds. These findings emphasize the importance of cybersecurity in the deployment of LLM-driven robotic systems and suggest a framework adaptable to various online platforms.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Attention-Guided Perturbation for Unsupervised Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07490v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstruction-based methods have significantly advanced unsupervised image anomaly detection involving only normal training images. However, it has been proven that modern neural networks generally have a strong reconstruction capacity and often reconstruct both normal and abnormal samples well, thereby failing to spot anomaly regions by checking the reconstruction quality. To prevent well-reconstructed anomalies, one simple but effective strategy is to perturb normal samples and then map perturbed versions to normal ones. Yet it treats each spatial position equally, disregarding the fact that the foreground locations are inherently more important for reconstruction. Motivated by this, we present a simple yet effective reconstruction framework named Attention-Guided Perturbation Network (AGPNet), which learns to add perturbations guided with an attention mask during training. Specifically, it consists of two branches, \ie, a reconstruction branch and an auxiliary attention-based perturbation branch. The reconstruction branch learns to reconstruct normal samples, while the auxiliary one aims to produce attention masks to guide the noise perturbation process for normal samples. By doing so, we are expecting to synthesize hard yet more informative anomalies for training, which enable the reconstruction branch to learn important inherent normal patterns both comprehensively and efficiently. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular benchmarks covering MVTec-AD, VisA, and MVTec-3D, and show that AGPNet obtains leading anomaly detection results under few-shot, one-class, and multi-class setups.</p></details> |  | None |

Industrial data exhibit characteristics such as multi-source heterogeneity, nonlinearity, strong coupling, and temporal interactions, while also being affected by noise interference. These complexities make it challenging for traditional anomaly detection methods to extract key features, impacting detection accuracy and stability. Traditional machine learning approaches often struggle with such complex data due to limitations in processing capacity and generalisation ability, making them inadequate for practical applications. While deep learning feature extraction modules have demonstrated remarkable performance in image and text processing, they remain ineffective when applied to multi-source heterogeneous industrial data lacking explicit correlations. Moreover, existing multi-source heterogeneous data processing techniques still rely on dimensionality reduction and feature selection, which can lead to information loss and difficulty in capturing high-order interactions. To address these challenges, this study applies the EAPCR and Time-EAPCR models proposed in previous research and introduces a new model, Time-EAPCR-T, where Transformer replaces the LSTM module in the time-series processing component of Time-EAPCR. This modification effectively addresses multi-source data heterogeneity, facilitates efficient multi-source feature fusion, and enhances the temporal feature extraction capabilities of multi-source industrial data.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across four industrial datasets, highlighting its broad application potential.</p></details> |  | None |

Although these proposed semi-supervised GAD methods have achieved great success, their superior performance will be seriously degraded when the provided labels are extremely limited due to some unpredictable factors. Besides, the existing methods primarily focus on anomaly detection in static graphs, and little effort was paid to consider the continuous evolution characteristic of graphs over time (dynamic graphs). To address these challenges, we propose a novel GAD framework (EL$^{2}$-DGAD) to tackle anomaly detection problem in dynamic graphs with extremely limited labels. Specifically, a transformer-based graph encoder model is designed to more effectively preserve evolving graph structures beyond the local neighborhood. Then, we incorporate an ego-context hypersphere classification loss to classify temporal interactions according to their structure and temporal neighborhoods while ensuring the normal samples are mapped compactly against anomalous data. Finally, the above loss is further augmented with an ego-context contrasting module which utilizes unlabeled data to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three label rates demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the existing GAD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 30th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA 2025)</p></details> | None |

To ensure the reliability and availability of large-scale language models in cloud computing scenarios, such as frequent resource failures, network problems, and computational overheads, this study proposes a novel adaptive fault tolerance mechanism. It builds upon known fault-tolerant mechanisms, such as checkpointing, redundancy, and state transposition, introducing dynamic resource allocation and prediction of failure based on real-time performance metrics. The hybrid model integrates data driven deep learning-based anomaly detection technique underlining the contribution of cloud orchestration middleware for predictive prevention of system failures. Additionally, the model integrates adaptive checkpointing and recovery strategies that dynamically adapt according to load and system state to minimize the influence on the performance of the model and minimize downtime. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed model considerably enhances the fault tolerance in large-scale cloud surroundings, and decreases the system downtime by $\mathbf{30\%}$, and has a better modeling availability than the classical fault tolerance mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICCEA 2025</p></details> | None |

Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Various studies have aimed to enhance iForest, but the resulting algorithms often exhibited significant performance disparities across datasets. Additionally, the challenge of isolating rare and widely distributed anomalies persisted in research focused on improving splits. To address these challenges, we introduce Robust iForest (RiForest). RiForest leverages both existing features and random hyperplanes obtained through soft sparse random projection to identify superior split features for anomaly detection, independent of datasets. It utilizes the underutilized valley emphasis method for optimal split point determination and incorporates sparsity randomization in soft sparse random projection for enhanced anomaly detection robustness.

Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach has demonstrated great effectiveness in GAD by first encoding graph data into low-dimensional representations and then identifying anomalies under the guidance of supervised or unsupervised signals. However, existing GNN-based approaches implicitly follow the homophily principle (i.e., the "like attracts like" phenomenon) and fail to learn discriminative embedding for anomalies that connect vast normal nodes. Moreover, such approaches identify anomalies in a unified global perspective but overlook diversified abnormal patterns conditioned on local graph context, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a Multi-hypersphere Heterophilic Graph Learning (MHetGL) framework for unsupervised GAD. Specifically, we first devise a Heterophilic Graph Encoding (HGE) module to learn distinguishable representations for potential anomalies by purifying and augmenting their neighborhood in a fully unsupervised manner. Then, we propose a Multi-Hypersphere Learning (MHL) module to enhance the detection capability for context-dependent anomalies by jointly incorporating critical patterns from both global and local perspectives. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets show that MHetGL outperforms 14 baselines.

This deficiency often leads to the detection of anomalous entities or actions that are susceptible to machine illusions and lack sufficient explanation. In this thesis, we propose a novel approach to anomaly detection, termed Hoi2Anomaly, which aims to achieve precise discrimination and localization of anomalies. The proposed methodology involves the construction of a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset comprising human-object interaction (HOI) pairs in anomalous scenarios. Second, we have trained an HOI extractor in threat scenarios to localize and match anomalous actions and entities. Finally, explanatory content is generated for the detected anomalous HOI by fine-tuning the visual language pretraining (VLP) framework. The experimental results demonstrate that Hoi2Anomaly surpasses existing generative approaches in terms of precision and explainability. We will release Hoi2Anomaly for the advancement of the field of anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several Gaia DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine learning approach that uses only the Gaia DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions. Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 20 best candidates of which two are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. The companion around the Sun-like star G\,15-6 could be confirmed as a genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 15 figures. Published in MNRAS.

Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation, applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis. In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

Traditional Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) methods focus on frame-level anomaly prediction, often missing the interpretability of complex and diverse real-world anomalies. Recent multimodal approaches leverage visual and textual data but lack hierarchical annotations that capture both short-term and long-term anomalies. To address this challenge, we introduce HIVAU-70k, a large-scale benchmark for hierarchical video anomaly understanding across any granularity. We develop a semi-automated annotation engine that efficiently scales high-quality annotations by combining manual video segmentation with recursive free-text annotation using large language models (LLMs). This results in over 70,000 multi-granular annotations organized at clip-level, event-level, and video-level segments. For efficient anomaly detection in long videos, we propose the Anomaly-focused Temporal Sampler (ATS). ATS integrates an anomaly scorer with a density-aware sampler to adaptively select frames based on anomaly scores, ensuring that the multimodal LLM concentrates on anomaly-rich regions, which significantly enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our hierarchical instruction data markedly improves anomaly comprehension. The integrated ATS and visual-language model outperform traditional methods in processing long videos. Our benchmark and model are publicly available at https://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAU.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | [Code Link](https://github.com/pipixin321/HolmesVAU) |
| **[Federated Koopman-Reservoir Learning for Large-Scale Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11255v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of edge devices has dramatically increased the generation of multivariate time-series (MVTS) data, essential for applications from healthcare to smart cities. Such data streams, however, are vulnerable to anomalies that signal crucial problems like system failures or security incidents. Traditional MVTS anomaly detection methods, encompassing statistical and centralized machine learning approaches, struggle with the heterogeneity, variability, and privacy concerns of large-scale, distributed environments. In response, we introduce FedKO, a novel unsupervised Federated Learning framework that leverages the linear predictive capabilities of Koopman operator theory along with the dynamic adaptability of Reservoir Computing. This enables effective spatiotemporal processing and privacy preservation for MVTS data. FedKO is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, utilizing a specific federated algorithm to explore a shared Reservoir-Koopman model across diverse datasets. Such a model is then deployable on edge devices for efficient detection of anomalies in local MVTS streams. Experimental results across various datasets showcase FedKO's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in MVTS anomaly detection. Moreover, FedKO reduces up to 8x communication size and 2x memory usage, making it highly suitable for large-scale systems.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 | None |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, most existing works focus on segmenting known objects, overlooking the identification of unknown classes, which is common in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a feature-oriented framework for open-set semantic segmentation on LiDAR data, capable of identifying unknown objects while retaining the ability to classify known ones. We design a decomposed dual-decoder network to simultaneously perform closed-set semantic segmentation and generate distinctive features for unknown objects. The network is trained with multi-objective loss functions to capture the characteristics of known and unknown objects. Using the extracted features, we introduce an anomaly detection mechanism to identify unknown objects. By integrating the results of close-set semantic segmentation and anomaly detection, we achieve effective feature-driven LiDAR open-set semantic segmentation. Evaluations on both SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, traditional methods process each view independently, disregarding the complementary information across viewpoints. Existing multi-view anomaly detection approaches typically employ data-driven cross-view attention for feature fusion but fail to leverage the unique geometric properties of multi-camera setups. In this work, we introduce an epipolar geometry-constrained attention module to guide cross-view fusion, ensuring more effective information aggregation. To further enhance the potential of cross-view attention, we propose a pretraining strategy inspired by memory bank-based anomaly detection. This approach encourages normal feature representations to form multiple local clusters and incorporate multi-view aware negative sample synthesis to regularize pretraining. We demonstrate that our epipolar guided multi-view anomaly detection framework outperforms existing methods on the state-of-the-art multi-view anomaly detection dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper explores whether high-quality visual features alone are sufficient to rival existing state-of-the-art vision-language models. We affirm this by adapting DINOv2 for one-shot and few-shot anomaly detection, with a focus on industrial applications. We show that this approach does not only rival existing techniques but can even outmatch them in many settings. Our proposed vision-only approach, AnomalyDINO, follows the well-established patch-level deep nearest neighbor paradigm, and enables both image-level anomaly prediction and pixel-level anomaly segmentation. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. Despite its simplicity, AnomalyDINO achieves state-of-the-art results in one- and few-shot anomaly detection (e.g., pushing the one-shot performance on MVTec-AD from an AUROC of 93.1% to 96.6%). The reduced overhead, coupled with its outstanding few-shot performance, makes AnomalyDINO a strong candidate for fast deployment, e.g., in industrial contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025 (Oral)</p></details> | None |

As advanced technology systems become increasingly prevalent across various sectors, the need for robust defence mechanisms against adversarial attacks becomes paramount. The study aims to develop and evaluate novel techniques for detecting and preventing data poisoning attacks, focusing on both theoretical frameworks and practical applications. Through a comprehensive literature review, experimental validation using the CIFAR-10 and Insurance Claims datasets, and the development of innovative algorithms, this paper seeks to enhance the resilience of AI models against malicious data manipulation. The study explores various methods, including anomaly detection, robust optimization strategies, and ensemble learning, to identify and mitigate the effects of poisoned data during model training. Experimental results indicate that data poisoning significantly degrades model performance, reducing classification accuracy by up to 27% in image recognition tasks (CIFAR-10) and 22% in fraud detection models (Insurance Claims dataset). The proposed defence mechanisms, including statistical anomaly detection and adversarial training, successfully mitigated poisoning effects, improving model robustness and restoring accuracy levels by an average of 15-20%. The findings further demonstrate that ensemble learning techniques provide an additional layer of resilience, reducing false positives and false negatives caused by adversarial data injections.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures | None |

However, traditional monitoring methods suffer from delayed responses, insufficient data processing capabilities, and weak generalisation, making them unsuitable for complex environmental monitoring needs.In recent years, machine learning has been widely applied to anomaly detection, but the multi-dimensional features and spatiotemporal dynamics of environmental ecological data, especially the long-term dependencies and strong variability in the time dimension, limit the effectiveness of traditional methods.Deep learning, with its ability to automatically learn features, captures complex nonlinear relationships, improving detection performance. However, its application in environmental monitoring is still in its early stages and requires further exploration.This paper introduces a new deep learning method, Time-EAPCR (Time-Embedding-Attention-Permutated CNN-Residual), and applies it to environmental science. The method uncovers feature correlations, captures temporal evolution patterns, and enables precise anomaly detection in environmental systems.We validated Time-EAPCR's high accuracy and robustness across four publicly available environmental datasets. Experimental results show that the method efficiently handles multi-source data, improves detection accuracy, and excels across various scenarios with strong adaptability and generalisation. Additionally, a real-world river monitoring dataset confirmed the feasibility of its deployment, providing reliable technical support for environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Can LLMs Understand Time Series Anomalies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05440v3)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, but their potential for anomaly detection remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: (1) LLMs understand time series better as images rather than as text, (2) LLMs do not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in explicit reasoning about time series analysis. (3) Contrary to common beliefs, LLMs' understanding of time series does not stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities. (4) LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis vary significantly across different models. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand trivial time series anomalies, we have no evidence that they can understand more subtle real-world anomalies. Many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold.

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> | None |

Traditional packet-based analysis methods are insufficient because in large networks the amount of traffic is so high that it is unfeasible to review all communications. For this reason, flows is a suitable approach for this situation, which in future 5G networks will have to be used, as the number of packets will increase dramatically. If this is also combined with unsupervised learning models, it can detect new threats for which it has not been trained. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on unsupervised learning algorithms for detecting anomalies in network flows, following the PRISMA guideline. A total of 63 scientific articles have been reviewed, analyzing 13 of them in depth. The results obtained show that autoencoder is the most used option, followed by SVM, ALAD, or SOM.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in various fields, the use of LLMs in enabling the detection of log anomalies is largely unexplored. This work aims to fill this gap. Due to the prohibitive costs involved in fully fine-tuning LLMs, we explore the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) for adapting LLMs to LAD. To have an in-depth exploration of the potential of LLM-driven LAD, we present a comprehensive investigation of leveraging two of the most popular PEFTs -- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) -- to tap into three prominent LLMs of varying size, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, and Llama-3, for parameter-efficient LAD. Comprehensive experiments on four public log datasets are performed to reveal important insights into effective LLM-driven LAD in several key perspectives, including the efficacy of these PEFT-based LLM-driven LAD methods, their stability, sample efficiency, robustness w.r.t. unstable logs, and cross-dataset generalization.

Insights from a Configurable Transformer-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20503v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log data are generated from logging statements in the source code, providing insights into the execution processes of software applications and systems. State-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection approaches typically leverage deep learning models to capture the semantic or sequential information in the log data and detect anomalous runtime behaviors. However, the impacts of these different types of information are not clear. In addition, most existing approaches ignore the timestamps in log data, which can potentially provide fine-grained sequential and temporal information. In this work, we propose a configurable Transformer-based anomaly detection model that can capture the semantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data and allows us to configure the different types of information as the model's features. Additionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log sequences of different lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing methods that rely on fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs. With the proposed model, we conduct a series of experiments with different combinations of input features to evaluate the roles of different types of information in anomaly detection. The model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance compared to the baselines when presented with log sequences of varying lengths. The results indicate that the event occurrence information plays a key role in identifying anomalies, while the impact of the sequential and temporal information is not significant for anomaly detection on the studied public datasets. On the other hand, the findings also reveal the simplicity of the studied public datasets and highlight the importance of constructing new datasets that contain different types of anomalies to better evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.</p></details> | 30 pages | None |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</p></details> |  | None |

Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception~(ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine~(SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 3.2\% and 13.1\%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</p></details> | AAAI2025 Poster | None |

Anomaly detection can be used to reduce those risks and increase reliability. In this work, we propose a novel enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) to predict the failure of an industrial pump based on the vibration data captured by an acceleration sensor. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed with a focus on low complexity to enable its implementation on edge devices with limited computational resources. Therefore, a detailed design space exploration is performed to find a topology satisfying the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Moreover, to allow for adaptation to unknown pumps, our algorithm features a pump-specific parameter that can be determined by a small set of normal data samples. Finally, we combine the ECNN with a threshold approach to further increase the performance and satisfy the application requirements. As a result, our combined approach significantly outperforms a traditional statistical approach and a classical CNN in terms of accuracy. To summarize, this work provides a novel, low-complex, CNN-based algorithm that is enhanced by classical methods to offer high accuracy for anomaly detection of industrial pumps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and to be presented as a poster at the 2025 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI)</p></details> | None |

Security-aware sensor fusion helps mitigate threats but requires accurate field of view (FOV) estimation which has not been evaluated autonomy. To address this gap, we adapt classical computer graphics algorithms to develop the first autonomy-relevant FOV estimators and create the first datasets with ground truth FOV labels. Unfortunately, we find that these approaches are themselves highly vulnerable to attacks on sensing. To improve robustness of FOV estimation against attacks, we propose a learning-based segmentation model that captures FOV features, integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) for uncertainty quantification, and performs anomaly detection on confidence maps. We illustrate through comprehensive evaluations attack resistance and strong generalization across environments. Architecture trade studies demonstrate the model is feasible for real-time deployment in multiple applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[State Frequency Estimation for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03442v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many works have studied the efficacy of state machines for detecting anomalies within NetFlows. These works typically learn a model from unlabeled data and compute anomaly scores for arbitrary traces based on their likelihood of occurrence or how well they fit within the model. However, these methods do not dynamically adapt their scores based on the traces seen at test time. This becomes a problem when an adversary produces seemingly common traces in their attack, causing the model to miss the detection by assigning low anomaly scores. We propose SEQUENT, a new unsupervised approach that uses the state visit frequency of a state machine to adapt its scoring dynamically for anomaly detection. SEQUENT subsequently uses the scores to generate root causes for anomalies. These allow the grouping of alarms and simplify the analysis of anomalies. We evaluate SEQUENT's effectiveness in detecting network anomalies on three publicly available NetFlow datasets and compare its performance against various existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Our evaluation shows promising results for using the state visit frequency of a state machine to detect network anomalies.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

However, traditional models often focus solely on temporal features, limiting their ability to capture underlying information. This paper proposes a novel time series multitask framework, called LTM, which integrates temporal features with textual descriptions to enhance analytical and predictive capabilities. LTM combines pre-trained time series model, large language model (LLM), and knowledge graph to tackle time series tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. LTM achieves improved performance with a few trainable parameters. It is very efficient and practical. LTM encodes time series data into patches and enriches user-provided prompts using knowledge graphs to generate enhanced prompts. A novel feature fusion method embeds prompts into each patch encoding, which is processed by a frozen LLM, followed by a feature enhancement module and a time decoder module. During fine-tuning stage, cosine similarity between prompts and temporal patches is integrated into the loss function to boost performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that LTM significantly outperforms existing methods. It provides a robust and versatile solution for time series tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniVAD: A Training-free Unified Model for Few-shot Visual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03342v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify abnormal samples in images that deviate from normal patterns, covering multiple domains, including industrial, logical, and medical fields. Due to the domain gaps between these fields, existing VAD methods are typically tailored to each domain, with specialized detection techniques and model architectures that are difficult to generalize across different domains. Moreover, even within the same domain, current VAD approaches often follow a "one-category-one-model" paradigm, requiring large amounts of normal samples to train class-specific models, resulting in poor generalizability and hindering unified evaluation across domains. To address this issue, we propose a generalized few-shot VAD method, UniVAD, capable of detecting anomalies across various domains, such as industrial, logical, and medical anomalies, with a training-free unified model. UniVAD only needs few normal samples as references during testing to detect anomalies in previously unseen objects, without training on the specific domain. Specifically, UniVAD employs a Contextual Component Clustering ($C^3$) module based on clustering and vision foundation models to segment components within the image accurately, and leverages Component-Aware Patch Matching (CAPM) and Graph-Enhanced Component Modeling (GECM) modules to detect anomalies at different semantic levels, which are aggregated to produce the final detection result. We conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning industrial, logical, and medical fields, and the results demonstrate that UniVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot anomaly detection tasks across multiple domains, outperforming domain-specific anomaly detection models.

This paper introduces a real-world, multivariate time series dataset collected exclusively from a single anonymized engine component (Component X) across a fleet of SCANIA trucks. The dataset includes operational data, repair records, and specifications related to Component X, while maintaining confidentiality through anonymization. It is well-suited for a range of machine learning applications, including classification, regression, survival analysis, and anomaly detection, particularly in predictive maintenance scenarios. The dataset's large population size, diverse features (in the form of histograms and numerical counters), and temporal information make it a unique resource in the field. The objective of releasing this dataset is to give a broad range of researchers the possibility of working with real-world data from an internationally well-known company and introduce a standard benchmark to the predictive maintenance field, fostering reproducible research.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures | None |

Designing decision tree models remains especially challenging given the intractably large search space, and most existing methods rely on greedy heuristics, while deep learning inductive biases expect a temporal or spatial structure not naturally present in tabular data. We propose a hybrid amortized structure inference approach to learn predictive decision tree ensembles given data, formulating decision tree construction as a sequential planning problem. We train a deep reinforcement learning (GFlowNet) policy to solve this problem, yielding a generative model that samples decision trees from the Bayesian posterior. We show that our approach, DT-GFN, outperforms state-of-the-art decision tree and deep learning methods on standard classification benchmarks derived from real-world data, robustness to distribution shifts, and anomaly detection, all while yielding interpretable models with shorter description lengths. Samples from the trained DT-GFN model can be ensembled to construct a random forest, and we further show that the performance of scales consistently in ensemble size, yielding ensembles of predictors that continue to generalize systematically.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: $\href{https://github.com/GFNOrg/dt-gfn}{https://github.com/GFNOrg/dt-gfn}$</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/GFNOrg/dt-gfn) |

In this work, we introduce a novel co-working framework for robots that unifies goal-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) with a Generative AI (GenAI)-agent under a semantic-aware network. SemCom prioritizes the exchange of meaningful information among robots and the network, thereby reducing overhead and latency. Meanwhile, the GenAI-agent leverages generative AI models to interpret high-level task instructions, allocate resources, and adapt to dynamic changes in both network and robotic environments. This agent-driven paradigm ushers in a new level of autonomy and intelligence, enabling complex tasks of networked robots to be conducted with minimal human intervention. We validate our approach through a multi-robot anomaly detection use-case simulation, where robots detect, compress, and transmit relevant information for classification. Simulation results confirm that SemCom significantly reduces data traffic while preserving critical semantic details, and the GenAI-agent ensures task coordination and network adaptation. This synergy provides a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for modern industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Mamba-based models, with their superior long-range modeling and linear efficiency, have garnered substantial attention. This study pioneers the application of Mamba to multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, presenting MambaAD, which consists of a pre-trained encoder and a Mamba decoder featuring (Locality-Enhanced State Space) LSS modules at multi-scales. The proposed LSS module, integrating parallel cascaded (Hybrid State Space) HSS blocks and multi-kernel convolutions operations, effectively captures both long-range and local information. The HSS block, utilizing (Hybrid Scanning) HS encoders, encodes feature maps into five scanning methods and eight directions, thereby strengthening global connections through the (State Space Model) SSM. The use of Hilbert scanning and eight directions significantly improves feature sequence modeling. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse anomaly detection datasets and seven metrics demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, substantiating the method's effectiveness.

While CLIP shows promise for zero-shot AD tasks due to its strong generalization capabilities, its inherent Anomaly-Unawareness leads to limited discrimination between normal and abnormal features. To address this problem, we propose Anomaly-Aware CLIP (AA-CLIP), which enhances CLIP's anomaly discrimination ability in both text and visual spaces while preserving its generalization capability. AA-CLIP is achieved through a straightforward yet effective two-stage approach: it first creates anomaly-aware text anchors to differentiate normal and abnormal semantics clearly, then aligns patch-level visual features with these anchors for precise anomaly localization. This two-stage strategy, with the help of residual adapters, gradually adapts CLIP in a controlled manner, achieving effective AD while maintaining CLIP's class knowledge. Extensive experiments validate AA-CLIP as a resource-efficient solution for zero-shot AD tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in industrial and medical applications.

| **["Stones from Other Hills can Polish Jade": Zero-shot Anomaly Image Synthesis via Cross-domain Anomaly Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15211v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial image anomaly detection (IAD) is a pivotal topic with huge value. Due to anomaly's nature, real anomalies in a specific modern industrial domain (i.e. domain-specific anomalies) are usually too rare to collect, which severely hinders IAD. Thus, zero-shot anomaly synthesis (ZSAS), which synthesizes pseudo anomaly images without any domain-specific anomaly, emerges as a vital technique for IAD. However, existing solutions are either unable to synthesize authentic pseudo anomalies, or require cumbersome training. Thus, we focus on ZSAS and propose a brand-new paradigm that can realize both authentic and training-free ZSAS. It is based on a chronically-ignored fact: Although domain-specific anomalies are rare, real anomalies from other domains (i.e. cross-domain anomalies) are actually abundant and directly applicable to ZSAS. Specifically, our new ZSAS paradigm makes three-fold contributions: First, we propose a novel method named Cross-domain Anomaly Injection (CAI), which directly exploits cross-domain anomalies to enable highly authentic ZSAS in a training-free manner. Second, to supply CAI with sufficient cross-domain anomalies, we build the first Domain-agnostic Anomaly Dataset within our best knowledge, which provides ZSAS with abundant real anomaly patterns. Third, we propose a CAI-guided Diffusion Mechanism, which further breaks the quantity limit of real anomalies and enable unlimited anomaly synthesis. Our head-to-head comparison with existing ZSAS solutions justifies our paradigm's superior performance for IAD and demonstrates it as an effective and pragmatic ZSAS solution.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[When Unsupervised Domain Adaptation meets One-class Anomaly Detection: Addressing the Two-fold Unsupervised Curse by Leveraging Anomaly Scarcity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21022v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first fully unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). The performance of UAD techniques degrades significantly in the presence of a domain shift, difficult to avoid in a real-world setting. While UDA has contributed to solving this issue in binary and multi-class classification, such a strategy is ill-posed in UAD. This might be explained by the unsupervised nature of the two tasks, namely, domain adaptation and anomaly detection. Herein, we first formulate this problem that we call the two-fold unsupervised curse. Then, we propose a pioneering solution to this curse, considered intractable so far, by assuming that anomalies are rare. Specifically, we leverage clustering techniques to identify a dominant cluster in the target feature space. Posed as the normal cluster, the latter is aligned with the source normal features. Concretely, given a one-class source set and an unlabeled target set composed mostly of normal data and some anomalies, we fit the source features within a hypersphere while jointly aligning them with the features of the dominant cluster from the target set. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis on common adaptation benchmarks for anomaly detection, demonstrating the relevance of both the newly introduced paradigm and the proposed approach. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Accurate and Efficient Two-Stage Gun Detection in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06317v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in videos plays a crucial role in advancing applications such as public safety and anomaly detection. Existing methods have explored different techniques, including CNN, deep learning, and Transformers, for object detection and video classification. However, detecting tiny objects, e.g., guns, in videos remains challenging due to their small scale and varying appearances in complex scenes. Moreover, existing video analysis models for classification or detection often perform poorly in real-world gun detection scenarios due to limited labeled video datasets for training. Thus, developing efficient methods for effectively capturing tiny object features and designing models capable of accurate gun detection in real-world videos is imperative. To address these challenges, we make three original contributions in this paper. First, we conduct an empirical study of several existing video classification and object detection methods to identify guns in videos. Our extensive analysis shows that these methods may not accurately detect guns in videos. Second, we propose a novel two-stage gun detection method. In stage 1, we train an image-augmented model to effectively classify ``Gun'' videos. To make the detection more precise and efficient, stage 2 employs an object detection model to locate the exact region of the gun within video frames for videos classified as ``Gun'' by stage 1. Third, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific method achieves significant performance improvements and enhances efficiency compared with existing techniques. We also discuss challenges and future research directions in gun detection tasks in computer vision.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion for Pose-Based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17210v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is essential for computer vision research. Existing VAD methods utilize either reconstruction-based or prediction-based frameworks. The former excels at detecting irregular patterns or structures, whereas the latter is capable of spotting abnormal deviations or trends. We address pose-based video anomaly detection and introduce a novel framework called Dual Conditioned Motion Diffusion (DCMD), which enjoys the advantages of both approaches. The DCMD integrates conditioned motion and conditioned embedding to comprehensively utilize the pose characteristics and latent semantics of observed movements, respectively. In the reverse diffusion process, a motion transformer is proposed to capture potential correlations from multi-layered characteristics within the spectrum space of human motion. To enhance the discriminability between normal and abnormal instances, we design a novel United Association Discrepancy (UAD) regularization that primarily relies on a Gaussian kernel-based time association and a self-attention-based global association. Finally, a mask completion strategy is introduced during the inference stage of the reverse diffusion process to enhance the utilization of conditioned motion for the prediction branch of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is on https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/guijiejie/DCMD-main) |

We present a novel, lightweight pipeline for anomaly classification using keyword weights. Our pipeline employs a two-stage process: induction followed by deduction. In induction, descriptions are generated from normal and anomalous frames to identify and assign weights to relevant keywords. In deduction, inference frame descriptions are converted into keyword encodings using induction-derived weights for input into our neural network for anomaly classification. We achieved comparable performance on the three benchmarks UCSD Ped2, Shanghai Tech, and CUHK Avenue, with ROC AUC scores of 0.865, 0.745, and 0.742, respectively. These results are achieved without temporal context, making such a system viable for real-time applications. Our model improves implementation setup, interpretability, and inference speed for surveillance devices on the edge, introducing a performance trade-off against other video anomaly detection systems. As the generalization capabilities of open-source foundational models improve, our model demonstrates that the exclusive use of text for feature representations is a promising direction for efficient real-time interpretable video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

In practice training data lack those anomalous samples; hence state-of-the-art methods are trained to discriminate between normal and synthetically-generated pseudo-anomalous data. Most methods use data augmentation techniques on normal images to simulate anomalies. However the best-performing ones implicitly leverage a geometric bias present in the benchmarking datasets. This limits their usability in more general conditions. Others are relying on basic noising schemes that may be suboptimal in capturing the underlying structure of normal data. In addition most still favour the image domain to generate pseudo-anomalies training models end-to-end from only the normal class and overlooking richer representations of the information. To overcome these limitations we consider frozen yet rich feature spaces given by pretrained models and create pseudo-anomalous features with a novel adaptive linear feature perturbation technique. It adapts the noise distribution to each sample applies decaying linear perturbations to feature vectors and further guides the classification process using a contrastive learning objective. Experimental evaluation conducted on both standard and geometric bias-free datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach with respect to comparable baselines.

To overcome the limitations that they often overlook spectral anomaly and rely on large-scale matrix singular value decomposition, we first apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to alleviate spectral dimensionality redundancy and extract spectral anomaly and then employ LRTR to extract spatial anomaly while mitigating spatial redundancy, yielding a highly efffcient layered tensor decomposition (LTD) framework for HAD. An iterative algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization is developed to solve the proposed LTD model, with convergence guarantees provided. Moreover, we introduce a rank reduction strategy with validation mechanism that adaptively reduces data size while preventing excessive reduction. Theoretically, we rigorously establish the equivalence between the tensor tubal rank and tensor group sparsity regularization (TGSR) and, under mild conditions, demonstrate that the relaxed formulation of TGSR shares the same global minimizers and optimal values as its original counterpart. Experimental results on the Airport-Beach-Urban and MVTec datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the HAD task.</p></details> |  | None |

Confiscated seashells, cannot be returned to their ecosystems due to the lack of origin recognition. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically for seashell identification. We built a dataset from scratch, consisting of approximately 19000 images from the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Using this dataset, the model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding 85%. The model has been integrated into a user-friendly application, which has classified over 36,000 seashells to date, delivering real-time results within 3 seconds per image. To further enhance the system's accuracy, an anomaly detection mechanism was incorporated to filter out irrelevant or anomalous inputs, ensuring only valid seashell images are processed.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AnyAnomaly: Zero-Shot Customizable Video Anomaly Detection with LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04504v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive performance on VAD benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the UBnormal dataset and outperforming other methods in generalization across all datasets.

Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We apply it to create a background data template for weakly-supervised searches at the LHC. The method smoothly transforms sideband events to match signal region mass distributions. We demonstrate the performance of TRANSIT using the LHC Olympics R\&D dataset. The model captures non-linear mass correlations of features and produces a template that offers a competitive anomaly sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art transport-based template generators. Moreover, the computational training time required for TRANSIT is an order of magnitude lower than that of competing deep learning methods. This makes it ideal for analyses that iterate over many signal regions and signal models. Unlike generative models, which must learn a full probability density distribution, i.e., the correlations between all the variables, the proposed transport model only has to learn a smooth conditional shift of the distribution. This allows for a simpler, more efficient residual architecture, enabling mass uncorrelated features to pass the network unchanged while the mass correlated features are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, we show that the latent space of the model provides a set of mass decorrelated features useful for anomaly detection without background sculpting.</p></details> | 34 pages, 14 figures | None |

This imbalance, rooted in logic and the theory of recursive modelling frameworks, cannot be solved directly. We propose a computational framework, $\aleph$-IPOMDP, augmenting model-based RL agents' Bayesian inference with an anomaly detection algorithm and an out-of-belief policy. Our mechanism allows agents to realize they are being deceived, even if they cannot understand how, and to deter opponents via a credible threat. We test this framework in both a mixed-motive and zero-sum game. Our results show the $\aleph$ mechanism's effectiveness, leading to more equitable outcomes and less exploitation by more sophisticated agents.

The number of information security events generated by information security tools grows up with the development of the IT infrastructure. At the same time, the cyber threat landscape does not remain constant, and monitoring should take into account both already known attack indicators and those for which there are no signature rules in information security products of various classes yet. Detecting anomalies in large cybersecurity data streams is a complex task that, if properly addressed, can allow for timely response to atypical and previously unknown cyber threats. The possibilities of using of offline algorithms may be limited for a number of reasons related to the time of training and the frequency of retraining. Using stream learning algorithms for solving this task is capable of providing near-real-time data processing. This article examines the results of ten algorithms from three Python stream machine-learning libraries on BETH dataset with cybersecurity events, which contains information about the creation, cloning, and destruction of operating system processes collected using extended eBPF. ROC-AUC metric and total processing time of processing with these algorithms are presented. Several combinations of features and the order of events are considered.

Unlike traditional approaches, which address these problems using parameter-sharing, we consider an alternative methodology based on irreducible representations and Schur's lemma. Using this methodology, we obtain an alternative derivation for existing models like DeepSets, 2-IGN graph equivariant networks, and Deep Weight Space (DWS) networks. The derivation for DWS networks is significantly simpler than that of previous results. Next, we extend our approach to unaligned symmetric sets, where equivariance to the wreath product of groups is required. Previous works have addressed this problem in a rather restrictive setting, in which almost all wreath equivariant layers are Siamese. In contrast, we give a full characterization of layers in this case and show that there is a vast number of additional non-Siamese layers in some settings. We also show empirically that these additional non-Siamese layers can improve performance in tasks like graph anomaly detection, weight space alignment, and learning Wasserstein distances.

Existing machine learning models often rely only on a single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore, task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and security tasks.

Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks. Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification, and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy, lower false positive rates, and improved scalability. By addressing the limitations of single-level models and unifying traffic analysis paradigms, UniNet sets a new benchmark for modern network security.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures,15 tables</p></details> | None |

The long-term goal of Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is to enable machines to autonomously replicate this skill. However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality. We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies. Additionally, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Explanation (PAEval) metric, designed to assess the ability of visual-language foundation models to not only detect anomalies but also provide accurate explanations for their underlying physical causes.

In air disc brake manufacturing, ensuring the precision of laser-engraved nameplates is crucial for accurate product identification and quality control. Engraving errors, such as misprints or missing characters, can compromise both aesthetics and functionality, leading to material waste and production delays. This paper presents a proof of concept for an AI-driven computer vision system that inspects and verifies laser-engraved nameplates, detecting defects in logos and alphanumeric strings.

Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness, achieving 91.33% accuracy and 100% recall, ensuring that defective nameplates are consistently detected and addressed.

This paper presents a hybrid framework that combines numerical anomaly detection using Autoencoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced preprocessing and interpretability. Two preprocessing approaches are implemented: a traditional method utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and an LLM-assisted method where GPT-4 dynamically recommends feature selection, transformation, and encoding strategies. Experimental results on the KDDCup99 10% corrected dataset demonstrate that the LLM-assisted preprocessing pipeline significantly improves anomaly detection performance. The macro-average F1 score increased from 0.49 in the traditional PCA-based approach to 0.98 with LLM-driven insights. Additionally, the LLM generates natural language explanations for detected anomalies, providing contextual insights into their causes and implications. This framework highlights the synergy between numerical AI models and LLMs, delivering an accurate, interpretable, and efficient solution for IoT cybersecurity in critical infrastructure.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Optimal Cascade Feature-Level Spatiotemporal Fusion Strategy for Anomaly Detection in CAN Bus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18821v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles represent a revolutionary advancement driven by the integration of artificial intelligence within intelligent transportation systems. However, they remain vulnerable due to the absence of robust security mechanisms in the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. In order to mitigate the security issue, many machine learning models and strategies have been proposed, which primarily focus on a subset of dominant patterns of anomalies and lack rigorous evaluation in terms of reliability and robustness. Therefore, to address the limitations of previous works and mitigate the security vulnerability in CAN bus, the current study develops a model based on the intrinsic nature of the problem to cover all dominant patterns of anomalies. To achieve this, a cascade feature-level fusion strategy optimized by a two-parameter genetic algorithm is proposed to combine temporal and spatial information. Subsequently, the model is evaluated using a paired t-test to ensure reliability and robustness. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis conducted on two widely used datasets advocates that the proposed model outperforms other models and achieves superior accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating the best performance among all models presented to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: u...</summary><p>v2: updated the text and graphs</p></details> | None |

| **[Memory Efficient Continual Learning for Edge-Based Visual Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02691v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a critical task in computer vision with numerous real-world applications. However, deploying these models on edge devices presents significant challenges, such as constrained computational and memory resources. Additionally, dynamic data distributions in real-world settings necessitate continuous model adaptation, further complicating deployment under limited resources. To address these challenges, we present a novel investigation into the problem of Continual Learning for Visual Anomaly Detection (CLAD) on edge devices. We evaluate the STFPM approach, given its low memory footprint on edge devices, which demonstrates good performance when combined with the Replay approach. Furthermore, we propose to study the behavior of a recently proposed approach, PaSTe, specifically designed for the edge but not yet explored in the Continual Learning context. Our results show that PaSTe is not only a lighter version of STPFM, but it also achieves superior anomaly detection performance, improving the f1 pixel performance by 10% with the Replay technique. In particular, the structure of PaSTe allows us to test it using a series of Compressed Replay techniques, reducing memory overhead by a maximum of 91.5% compared to the traditional Replay for STFPM. Our study proves the feasibility of deploying VAD models that adapt and learn incrementally on CLAD scenarios on resource-constrained edge devices.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Discovering Antagonists in Networks of Systems: Robot Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20125v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A contextual anomaly detection method is proposed and applied to the physical motions of a robot swarm executing a coverage task. Using simulations of a swarm's normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment. During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antagonistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion correctly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally, the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the detection criterion are increased.</p></details> | reduced file size | None |

Despite their significance, there has been little systematic and empirical research on this concept due to issues of measurement and operationalization. We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in two scenarios: first, supplementing an initial list of media storms within a specific time frame; and second, detecting media storms in new time periods. We make available a media storm dataset compiled using both scenarios. Both the method and dataset offer the basis for comprehensive empirical research into the concept of media storms, including characterizing them and predicting their outbursts and durations, in mainstream media or social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted and published in Findings of EMNLP 2024.

| **[World Models for Anomaly Detection during Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02552v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based controllers are often purposefully kept out of real-world applications due to concerns about their safety and reliability. We explore how state-of-the-art world models in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning can be utilized beyond the training phase to ensure a deployed policy only operates within regions of the state-space it is sufficiently familiar with. This is achieved by continuously monitoring discrepancies between a world model's predictions and observed system behavior during inference. It allows for triggering appropriate measures, such as an emergency stop, once an error threshold is surpassed. This does not require any task-specific knowledge and is thus universally applicable. Simulated experiments on established robot control tasks show the effectiveness of this method, recognizing changes in local robot geometry and global gravitational magnitude. Real-world experiments using an agile quadcopter further demonstrate the benefits of this approach by detecting unexpected forces acting on the vehicle. These results indicate how even in new and adverse conditions, safe and reliable operation of otherwise unpredictable learning-based controllers can be achieved.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UMGAD: Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12556v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a critical task in graph machine learning, with the primary objective of identifying anomalous nodes that deviate significantly from the majority. This task is widely applied in various real-world scenarios, including fraud detection and social network analysis. However, existing GAD methods still face two major challenges: (1) They are often limited to detecting anomalies in single-type interaction graphs and struggle with multiple interaction types in multiplex heterogeneous graphs. (2) In unsupervised scenarios, selecting appropriate anomaly score thresholds remains a significant challenge for accurate anomaly detection. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Unsupervised Multiplex Graph Anomaly Detection method, named UMGAD. We first learn multi-relational correlations among nodes in multiplex heterogeneous graphs and capture anomaly information during node attribute and structure reconstruction through graph-masked autoencoder (GMAE). Then, to further extract abnormal information, we generate attribute-level and subgraph-level augmented-view graphs respectively, and perform attribute and structure reconstruction through GMAE. Finally, we learn to optimize node attributes and structural features through contrastive learning between original-view and augmented-view graphs to improve the model's ability to capture anomalies. Meanwhile, we also propose a new anomaly score threshold selection strategy, which allows the model to be independent of ground truth information in real unsupervised scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that our UMGAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 13.48% in AUC and 11.68% in Macro-F1 across all datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Intrinsic Normal Prototypes within a Single Image for Universal Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02424v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection, yet existing methods typically rely on ``comparing'' test images to normal references from a training set. However, variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image, limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations, meaning that even within anomalous images, valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore, rather than relying on external normality from the training set, we propose INP-Former, a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically, we introduce the INP Extractor, which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-Guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens, with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally, we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class, multi-class, and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD, VisA, and Real-IAD, positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD. Remarkably, INP-Former also demonstrates some zero-shot AD capability.

We establish the Fence Theorem, formalizing preprocessing as a dual-objective semantic isolator: (1) mitigating cross-semantic interference to the greatest extent feasible and (2) confining anomaly judgments to aligned semantic spaces wherever viable, thereby establishing intra-semantic comparability. Any preprocessing approach achieves this goal through a two-stage process of Emantic-Division and Spatial-Constraints stage. Through systematic deconstruction, we theoretically and experimentally subsume existing preprocessing methods under this theorem via tripartite evidence: qualitative analyses, quantitative studies, and mathematical proofs. Guided by the Fence Theorem, we implement Patch3D, consisting of Patch-Cutting and Patch-Matching modules, to segment semantic spaces and consolidate similar ones while independently modeling normal features within each space. Experiments on Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD with different settings demonstrate that progressively finer-grained semantic alignment in preprocessing directly enhances point-level AD accuracy, providing inverse validation of the theorem's causal logic.</p></details> |  | None |

This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard <10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</p></details> | None |

Traditional approaches, such as distance, density, or cluster-based methods, face significant challenges when applied to high dimensional tensor data, where complex interdependencies across dimensions amplify noise and computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper leverages Tensor Chidori pseudoskeleton decomposition within a tensor-robust principal component analysis framework to extract low Tucker rank structure while isolating sparse anomalies, ensuring robustness to anomaly detection. We establish theoretical results regarding convergence, and estimation error, demonstrating the stability and accuracy of the proposed approach. Numerical experiments on real-world spatiotemporal data from New York City taxi trip records validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting anomalous urban events compared to existing benchmark methods. Our results suggest that tensor pseudoskeleton decomposition may offer potential for enhancing anomaly detection in large-scale, high-dimensional data.</p></details> |  | None |

Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

| **[Building Machine Learning Challenges for Anomaly Detection in Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02112v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific discoveries are often made by finding a pattern or object that was not predicted by the known rules of science. Oftentimes, these anomalous events or objects that do not conform to the norms are an indication that the rules of science governing the data are incomplete, and something new needs to be present to explain these unexpected outliers. The challenge of finding anomalies can be confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge of the known scientific behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on the data to look for deviations. When utilizing machine learning, this presents a particular challenge since we require that the model not only understands scientific data perfectly but also recognizes when the data is inconsistent and out of the scope of its trained behavior. In this paper, we present three datasets aimed at developing machine learning-based anomaly detection for disparate scientific domains covering astrophysics, genomics, and polar science. We present the different datasets along with a scheme to make machine learning challenges around the three datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we present an approach that generalizes to future machine learning challenges, enabling the possibility of large, more compute-intensive challenges that can ultimately lead to scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages 6 figures to be submitted to Nature Communications</p></details> | None |

However, current GAD methods largely overlook the fairness problem, which might result in discriminatory decisions skewed toward certain demographic groups defined on sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, religion, ethnicity, etc.). This greatly limits the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios in light of societal and ethical restrictions. To address this critical gap, we make the first attempt to integrate fairness with utility in GAD decision-making. Specifically, we devise a novel DisEntangle-based FairnEss-aware aNomaly Detection framework on the attributed graph, named DEFEND. DEFEND first introduces disentanglement in GNNs to capture informative yet sensitive-irrelevant node representations, effectively reducing societal bias inherent in graph representation learning. Besides, to alleviate discriminatory bias in evaluating anomalous nodes, DEFEND adopts a reconstruction-based anomaly detection, which concentrates solely on node attributes without incorporating any graph structure. Additionally, given the inherent association between input and sensitive attributes, DEFEND constrains the correlation between the reconstruction error and the predicted sensitive attributes. Our empirical evaluations on real-world datasets reveal that DEFEND performs effectively in GAD and significantly enhances fairness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental results show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6% across four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common ECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each of these tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.

Traditional approaches often struggle with high false-positive rates, frequently misclassifying normal shadows and surface deformations as defects, an issue that becomes particularly pronounced in products with complex and intricate surface features. To address these challenges, we introduce PA-CLIP, a zero-shot anomaly detection method that reduces background noise and enhances defect detection through a pseudo-anomaly-based framework. The proposed method integrates a multiscale feature aggregation strategy for capturing detailed global and local information, two memory banks for distinguishing background information, including normal patterns and pseudo-anomalies, from true anomaly features, and a decision-making module designed to minimize false positives caused by environmental variations while maintaining high defect sensitivity. Demonstrated on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, PA-CLIP outperforms existing zero-shot methods, providing a robust solution for industrial defect detection.</p></details> | 9 pages | None |

The selection and optimization of anomaly detectors strongly rely on the availability of an effective performance evaluation method for TAD. Since anomalies in time-series data often manifest as a sequence of points, conventional metrics that solely consider the detection of individual point are inadequate. Existing evaluation methods for TAD typically employ point-based or event-based metrics to capture the temporal context. However, point-based metrics tend to overestimate detectors that excel only in detecting long anomalies, while event-based metrics are susceptible to being misled by fragmented detection results. To address these limitations, we propose OIPR, a novel set of TAD evaluation metrics. It models the process of operators receiving detector alarms and handling faults, utilizing area under the operator interest curve to evaluate the performance of TAD algorithms. Furthermore, we build a special scenario dataset to compare the characteristics of different evaluation methods. Through experiments conducted on the special scenario dataset and five real-world datasets, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of OIPR in extreme and complex scenarios. It achieves a balance between point and event perspectives, overcoming their primary limitations and offering applicability to broader situations.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurately modeling the boundary of normality is crucial for distinguishing abnormal data, but this is often challenging due to limited data or the presence of nuisance attributes. While unsupervised methods that rely solely on data without user guidance are common, they may fail to detect anomalies of specific interest. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Assisted Feature Transformation (LAFT), which leverages the shared image-text embedding space of vision-language models to transform visual features according to user-defined requirements. Combined with anomaly detection methods, LAFT effectively aligns visual features with user preferences, allowing anomalies of interest to be detected. Extensive experiments on both toy and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 | None |

Traditional health management methods, relying on expert identification or simple rule-based algorithms, struggle to cope with the dynamic heterogeneous networks (DHNs) environment. Moreover, current state-of-the-art distributed anomaly detection methods, which utilize specific machine learning techniques, lack multi-scale adaptivity for heterogeneous device information, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy for DHNs. In this paper, we develop an LLM-assisted end-to-end intelligent network health management framework. The framework first proposes a Multi-Scale Semanticized Anomaly Detection Model (MSADM), incorporating semantic rule trees with an attention mechanism to address the multi-scale anomaly detection problem in DHNs. Secondly, a chain-of-thought-based large language model is embedded in downstream to adaptively analyze the fault detection results and produce an analysis report with detailed fault information and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our proposed MSADM for heterogeneous network entity anomaly detection is as high as 91.31\%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CyberCScope: Mining Skewed Tensor Streams and Online Anomaly Detection in Cybersecurity Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00871v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cybersecurity systems are continuously producing a huge number of time-stamped events in the form of high-order tensors, such as {count; time, port, flow duration, packet size, . . . }, and so how can we detect anomalies/intrusions in real time? How can we identify multiple types of intrusions and capture their characteristic behaviors? The tensor data consists of categorical and continuous attributes and the data distributions of continuous attributes typically exhibit skew. These data properties require handling skewed infinite and finite dimensional spaces simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel streaming method, namely CyberCScope. The method effectively decomposes incoming tensors into major trends while explicitly distinguishing between categorical and skewed continuous attributes. To our knowledge, it is the first to compute hybrid skewed infinite and finite dimensional decomposition. Based on this decomposition, it streamingly finds distinct time-evolving patterns, enabling the detection of multiple types of anomalies. Extensive experiments on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that CyberCScope detects various intrusions with higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while providing meaningful summaries for the intrusions that occur in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW 2025 short research paper</p></details> | None |

This paper presents a methodology for non-destructively detecting cracks in UAM propellers using drone propeller sound datasets. Normal operating sounds were recorded, and abnormal sounds (categorized as ripped and broken) were differentiated by varying the microphone-propeller angle and throttle power. Our novel approach integrates FFT and STFT preprocessing techniques to capture both global frequency patterns and local time-frequency variations, thereby enhancing anomaly detection performance. The constructed Acoustic Dataset for Crack of Drone Propeller (ADCP) demonstrates the potential for detecting propeller cracks and lays the groundwork for future UAM maintenance applications.</p></details> | 25 pages | None |

Consequently, self-supervised anomaly detection (SSAD) has seen a recent surge of interest, since SSL is especially attractive for unsupervised tasks. However, recent works have reported that the choice of a data augmentation function has significant impact on the accuracy of SSAD, posing augmentation search as an essential but nontrivial problem with the lack of labeled validation data. In this paper, we introduce ST-SSAD, the first systematic approach for rigorous augmentation tuning on SSAD. To this end, our work presents two key contributions. The first is a new unsupervised validation loss that quantifies the alignment between augmented training data and unlabeled validation data. The second is new differentiable augmentation functions, allowing data augmentation hyperparameter(s) to be tuned in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two testbeds with semantic class anomalies and subtle industrial defects show that ST-SSAD gives significant performance gains over existing works.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Transformer Based Self-Context Aware Prediction for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection in Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00670v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in videos is a challenging task as anomalies in different videos are of different kinds. Therefore, a promising way to approach video anomaly detection is by learning the non-anomalous nature of the video at hand. To this end, we propose a one-class few-shot learning driven transformer based approach for anomaly detection in videos that is self-context aware. Features from the first few consecutive non-anomalous frames in a video are used to train the transformer in predicting the non-anomalous feature of the subsequent frame. This takes place under the attention of a self-context learned from the input features themselves. After the learning, given a few previous frames, the video-specific transformer is used to infer if a frame is anomalous or not by comparing the feature predicted by it with the actual. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the state-of-the-art is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative results on different standard datasets. We also study the positive effect of the self-context used in our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

This innovative method revolutionizes healthcare by facilitating early disease detection and tailored care, particularly in chronic disease management, where IoMT automates treatments based on real-time health data collection. Nonetheless, its benefits are countered by significant security challenges that endanger the lives of its users due to the sensitivity and value of the processed data, thereby attracting malicious interests. Moreover, the utilization of wireless communication for data transmission exposes medical data to interception and tampering by cybercriminals. Additionally, anomalies may arise due to human error, network interference, or hardware malfunctions. In this context, anomaly detection based on Machine Learning (ML) is an interesting solution, but it comes up against obstacles in terms of explicability and privacy protection. To address these challenges, a new framework for Intrusion Detection Systems is introduced, leveraging Artificial Neural Networks for intrusion detection while utilizing Federated Learning (FL) for privacy preservation. Additionally, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods are incorporated to enhance model explanation and interpretation. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated and compared with centralized approaches using multiple datasets containing network and medical data, simulating various attack types impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical and physiological data. The results obtained offer compelling evidence that the FL method performs comparably to the centralized method, demonstrating high performance. Additionally, it affords the dual advantage of safeguarding privacy and providing model explanation while adhering to ethical principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures, 15 tables, journal paper</p></details> | None |

Most research assumes ideal closed-set environments. However, in real-world open-set environments, graph learning models face challenges in robustness and reliability due to unseen classes. This highlights the need for Graph Open-Set Recognition (GOSR) methods to address these issues and ensure effective GNN application in practical scenarios. Research in GOSR is in its early stages, with a lack of a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse tasks and datasets to evaluate methods. Moreover, traditional methods, Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection (GOODD), GOSR, and Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) have mostly evolved in isolation, with little exploration of their interconnections or potential applications to GOSR. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textbf{G-OSR}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GOSR methods at both the node and graph levels, using datasets from multiple domains to ensure fair and standardized comparisons of effectiveness and efficiency across traditional, GOODD, GOSR, and GAD methods. The results offer critical insights into the generalizability and limitations of current GOSR methods and provide valuable resources for advancing research in this field through systematic analysis of diverse approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages,2 figures | None |
| **[Value Gradient Sampler: Sampling as Sequential Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13280v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Value Gradient Sampler (VGS), a trainable sampler based on the interpretation of sampling as discrete-time sequential decision-making. VGS generates samples from a given unnormalized density (i.e., energy) by drifting and diffusing randomly initialized particles. In VGS, finding the optimal drift is equivalent to solving an optimal control problem where the cost is the upper bound of the KL divergence between the target density and the samples. We employ value-based dynamic programming to solve this optimal control problem, which gives the gradient of the value function as the optimal drift vector. The connection to sequential decision making allows VGS to leverage extensively studied techniques in reinforcement learning, making VGS a fast, adaptive, and accurate sampler that achieves competitive results in various sampling benchmarks. Furthermore, VGS can replace MCMC in contrastive divergence training of energy-based models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VGS in training accurate energy-based models in industrial anomaly detection applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/swyoon/value-gradient-sampler/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/swyoon/value-gradient-sampler) |

Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> | None |

Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time series of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus. Deviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of biological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before a farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using wavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly detection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed features based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of the time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances. We hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in periodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis with two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily pattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological conditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as statistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance of detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and the days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that wavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly detection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and often precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow activity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states. The detection is often obtained on days that precede the day annotated by caretakers, which offer possibility to take corrective actions at an early stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> | None |
| **[FedDyMem: Efficient Federated Learning with Dynamic Memory and Memory-Reduce for Unsupervised Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21012v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised image anomaly detection (UAD) has become a critical process in industrial and medical applications, but it faces growing challenges due to increasing concerns over data privacy. The limited class diversity inherent to one-class classification tasks, combined with distribution biases caused by variations in products across and within clients, poses significant challenges for preserving data privacy with federated UAD. Thus, this article proposes an efficient federated learning method with dynamic memory and memory-reduce for unsupervised image anomaly detection, called FedDyMem. Considering all client data belongs to a single class (i.e., normal sample) in UAD and the distribution of intra-class features demonstrates significant skewness, FedDyMem facilitates knowledge sharing between the client and server through the client's dynamic memory bank instead of model parameters. In the local clients, a memory generator and a metric loss are employed to improve the consistency of the feature distribution for normal samples, leveraging the local model to update the memory bank dynamically. For efficient communication, a memory-reduce method based on weighted averages is proposed to significantly decrease the scale of memory banks. On the server, global memory is constructed and distributed to individual clients through k-means aggregation. Experiments conducted on six industrial and medical datasets, comprising a mixture of six products or health screening types derived from eleven public datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDyMem.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, we propose a Distribution Prototype Diffusion Learning (DPDL) method aimed at enclosing normal samples within a compact and discriminative distribution space. Specifically, we construct multiple learnable Gaussian prototypes to create a latent representation space for abundant and diverse normal samples and learn a Schr\"odinger bridge to facilitate a diffusive transition toward these prototypes for normal samples while steering anomaly samples away. Moreover, to enhance inter-sample separation, we design a dispersion feature learning way in hyperspherical space, which benefits the identification of out-of-distribution anomalies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed DPDL, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Generative models can mitigate this issue by synthesizing realistic defect samples, but existing approaches often fail to model the crucial interplay between defects and their background. This oversight leads to unrealistic anomalies, especially in scenarios where contextual consistency is essential (i.e., logical anomaly). To address this, we propose a novel background-aware defect generation framework, where the background influences defect denoising without affecting the background itself by ensuring realistic synthesis while preserving structural integrity. Our method leverages a disentanglement loss to separate the background' s denoising process from the defect, enabling controlled defect synthesis through DDIM Inversion. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach maintains background fidelity while generating contextually accurate defects. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and MVTec Loco benchmarks validate our mehtod's superiority over existing techniques in both defect generation quality and anomaly detection performance.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem, extending traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan aeroengine degradation. TDC-AE outperforms LSTMs and Transformers while achieving a 200x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust, interpretable signal for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HDM: Hybrid Diffusion Model for Unified Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19200v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image anomaly detection plays a vital role in applications such as industrial quality inspection and medical imaging, where it directly contributes to improving product quality and system reliability. However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods and datasets remain focused on a narrow spectrum of tasks, such as forecasting or anomaly detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce Time Series Multi-Task Question Answering (Time-MQA), a unified framework that enables natural language queries across multiple time series tasks - numerical analytical tasks and open-ended question answering with reasoning. Central to Time-MQA is the TSQA dataset, a large-scale dataset containing $\sim$200k question-answer pairs derived from diverse time series spanning environment, traffic, etc. This comprehensive resource covers various time series lengths and promotes robust model development. We further demonstrate how continually pre-training large language models (Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B) on the TSQA dataset enhanced time series reasoning capabilities, moving beyond mere numeric tasks and enabling more advanced and intuitive interactions with temporal data.

Here we develop a general theoretical framework for evaluating the depth of a Markov sample path and recovering it statistically from an estimate of its transition probability with (non-) asymptotic guarantees. We also detail some of its applications, focusing particularly on unsupervised anomaly detection. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, numerical experiments are displayed, providing empirical evidence of the relevance of the novel concept we introduce here to quantify the degree of abnormality of Markov paths of variable length.</p></details> |  | None |

With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  | None |

Anomaly detection results show good agreement with cluster results and further distinguish days in the same cluster by severity of disruptions. Results show an increasing trend in frequency of disruptions especially post-COVID.

Consequently, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data has emerged as an essential task to maintain the reliability and robustness of data-driven models, in general, and machine and deep learning models, in particular. In this study, we leveraged the convex hull property of a dataset and the fact that anomalies highly contribute to the increase of the CH's volume to propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm. Our algorithm computes the CH's volume as an increasing number of data points are removed from the dataset to define a decision line between OOD and in-distribution data points. We compared the proposed algorithm to seven widely used anomaly detection algorithms over ten datasets, showing comparable results for state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Moreover, we show that with a computationally cheap and simple check, one can detect datasets that are well-suited for the proposed algorithm which outperforms the SOTA anomaly detection algorithms.</p></details> |  | None |

It relies on a tree partition procedure where an abnormality score is computed by projecting each curve observation on a drawn dictionary through a linear inner product.

The answer lies in the concept of \rnthm{} theorem, a fundamental concept in measure theory. The key insight is -- Multiplying the vanilla loss function with the \rnthm{} derivative improves the performance across the board. We refer to this as RN-Loss.

This paper proposes an improved YOLOv7x-based anomaly detection algorithm for power equipment. First, the ACmix convolutional mixed attention mechanism module is introduced to effectively suppress background noise and irrelevant features, thereby enhancing the network's feature extraction capability. Second, the Biformer attention mechanism is added to the network to strengthen the focus on key features, improving the network's ability to flexibly recognize feature images. Finally, to more comprehensively evaluate the relationship between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes, the original loss function is replaced with the MPDIoU function, addressing the issue of mismatched predicted bounding boxes. The improved algorithm enhances detection accuracy, achieving a mAP@0.5/% of 93.5% for all target categories, a precision of 97.1%, and a recall of 97%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Novel Spatiotemporal Correlation Anomaly Detection Method Based on Time-Frequency-Domain Feature Fusion and a Dynamic Graph Neural Network in Wireless Sensor Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00036v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention-based transformers have played an important role in wireless sensor network (WSN) timing anomaly detection due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, there are several issues that must be addressed, such as the fact that their ability to capture long-term dependencies is not completely reliable, their computational complexity levels are high, and the spatiotemporal features of WSN timing data are not sufficiently extracted for detecting the correlation anomalies of multinode WSN timing data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a WSN anomaly detection method that integrates frequency-domain features with dynamic graph neural networks (GNN) under a designed self-encoder reconstruction framework. First, the discrete wavelet transform effectively decomposes trend and seasonal components of time series to solve the poor long-term reliability of transformers. Second, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to make full use of the difference between the amplitude distributions of normal data and anomalous data in this domain. Finally, a multimodal fusion-based dynamic graph convolutional network (MFDGCN) is designed by combining an attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to adaptively extract spatial correlation features. A series of experiments conducted on public datasets and their results demonstrate that the anomaly detection method designed in this paper exhibits superior precision and recall than the existing methods do, with an F1 score of 93.5%, representing an improvement of 2.9% over that of the existing models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series analysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? To answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in time series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series numerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models (LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In total, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios and 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with the univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation to more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series scenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights: 1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than point-wise anomalies. 2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the data missing. 3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While open-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs demonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively investigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time series scenarios. We release our dataset and code at https://github.com/mllm-ts/VisualTimeAnomaly to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for the main content; 32 pages for the full paper including the appendix.

Traditional unsupervised methods, which decode encoded latent representations of unlabeled data with a reconstruction focus, often fail to capture critical discriminative content, leading to suboptimal anomaly detection. To address these challenges, we present a Diffusion-based Graph Anomaly Detector (DiffGAD). At the heart of DiffGAD is a novel latent space learning paradigm, meticulously designed to enhance its proficiency by guiding it with discriminative content. This innovative approach leverages diffusion sampling to infuse the latent space with discriminative content and introduces a content-preservation mechanism that retains valuable information across different scales, significantly improving its adeptness at identifying anomalies with limited time and space complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of DiffGAD, conducted on six real-world and large-scale datasets with various metrics, demonstrated its exceptional performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A digital eye-fixation biomarker using a deep anomaly scheme to classify Parkisonian patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17762v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oculomotor alterations constitute a promising biomarker to detect and characterize Parkinson's disease (PD), even in prodromal stages. Currently, only global and simplified eye movement trajectories are employed to approximate the complex and hidden kinematic relationships of the oculomotor function. Recent advances on machine learning and video analysis have encouraged novel characterizations of eye movement patterns to quantify PD. These schemes enable the identification of spatiotemporal segments primarily associated with PD. However, they rely on discriminative models that require large training datasets and depend on balanced class distributions. This work introduces a novel video analysis scheme to quantify Parkinsonian eye fixation patterns with an anomaly detection framework. Contrary to classical deep discriminative schemes that learn differences among labeled classes, the proposed approach is focused on one-class learning, avoiding the necessity of a significant amount of data. The proposed approach focuses only on Parkinson's representation, considering any other class sample as an anomaly of the distribution. This approach was evaluated for an ocular fixation task, in a total of 13 control subjects and 13 patients on different stages of the disease. The proposed digital biomarker achieved an average sensitivity and specificity of 0.97 and 0.63, respectively, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.95. A statistical test shows significant differences (p < 0.05) among predicted classes, evidencing a discrimination between patients and control subjects.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 images | None |
| **[AnomalyAID: Reliable Interpretation for Semi-supervised Network Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11293v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised Learning plays a crucial role in network anomaly detection applications, however, learning anomaly patterns with limited labeled samples is not easy. Additionally, the lack of interpretability creates key barriers to the adoption of semi-supervised frameworks in practice. Most existing interpretation methods are developed for supervised/unsupervised frameworks or non-security domains and fail to provide reliable interpretations. In this paper, we propose AnomalyAID, a general framework aiming to (1) make the anomaly detection process interpretable and improve the reliability of interpretation results, and (2) assign high-confidence pseudo labels to unlabeled samples for improving the performance of anomaly detection systems with limited supervised data. For (1), we propose a novel interpretation approach that leverages global and local interpreters to provide reliable explanations, while for (2), we design a new two-stage semi-supervised learning framework for network anomaly detection by aligning both stages' model predictions with special constraints. We apply AnomalyAID over two representative network anomaly detection tasks and extensively evaluate AnomalyAID with representative prior works. Experimental results demonstrate that AnomalyAID can provide accurate detection results with reliable interpretations for semi-supervised network anomaly detection systems.

| **[Do Language Models Understand Time?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13845v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized video-based computer vision applications, including action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization. Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial complexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual data. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on pretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders to capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM frameworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However, the critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time, and how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos? This work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a specific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key limitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing gaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal concepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze challenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal annotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal understanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future directions, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of enriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures for integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning. By addressing these challenges, we aim to advance the temporal comprehension of LLMs, unlocking their full potential in video analysis and beyond.

Current DFL architectures ensure the trustworthiness of the aggregator node upon selection. However, most of these studies overlook the possibility that the aggregating node may turn rogue and act maliciously after being nominated. To address this problem, this paper proposes a DFL structure, called TrustChain, that scores the aggregators before selection based on their past behavior and additionally audits them after the aggregation. To do this, the statistical independence between the client updates and the aggregated model is continuously monitored using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The proposed method relies on several principles, including blockchain, anomaly detection, and concept drift analysis. The designed structure is evaluated on several federated datasets and attack scenarios with different numbers of Byzantine nodes.</p></details> |  | None |

The ability to detect anomalous situations outside of the operational design domain is a key component in self-driving cars, enabling us to mitigate the impact of abnormal ego behaviors and to realize trustworthy driving systems. On-road anomaly detection in egocentric videos remains a challenging problem due to the difficulties introduced by complex and interactive scenarios. We conduct a holistic analysis of common on-road anomaly patterns, from which we propose three unsupervised anomaly detection experts: a scene expert that focuses on frame-level appearances to detect abnormal scenes and unexpected scene motions; an interaction expert that models normal relative motions between two road participants and raises alarms whenever anomalous interactions emerge; and a behavior expert which monitors abnormal behaviors of individual objects by future trajectory prediction. To combine the strengths of all the modules, we propose an expert ensemble (Xen) using a Kalman filter, in which the final anomaly score is absorbed as one of the states and the observations are generated by the experts. Our experiments employ a novel evaluation protocol for realistic model performance, demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance than previous methods, and show that our framework has potential in classifying anomaly types using unsupervised learning on a large-scale on-road anomaly dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> | None |

Organizations must continuously meet evolving regulatory requirements such as GDPR and ISO 27001, yet traditional manual review processes have become increasingly inadequate for modern business scales. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based framework for automating cloud computing compliance processes, addressing critical challenges including resource-intensive manual reviews, extended compliance cycles, and delayed risk identification. Our proposed framework integrates multiple machine learning technologies, including BERT-based document processing (94.5% accuracy), One-Class SVM for anomaly detection (88.7% accuracy), and an improved CNN-LSTM architecture for sequential compliance data analysis (90.2% accuracy). Implementation results demonstrate significant improvements: reducing compliance process duration from 7 days to 1.5 days, improving accuracy from 78% to 93%, and decreasing manual effort by 73.3%.

This approach can achieve satisfactory results in cases where samples of a given deepfake generation technique have been seen during training, but can easily fail with deepfakes generated by other techniques. In this paper, we propose DiffFake, a novel deepfake detector that approaches the detection problem as an anomaly detection task. Specifically, DiffFake learns natural changes that occur between two facial images of the same person by leveraging a differential anomaly detection framework. This is done by combining pairs of deep face embeddings and using them to train an anomaly detection model. We further propose to train a feature extractor on pseudo-deepfakes with global and local artifacts, to extract meaningful and generalizable features that can then be used to train the anomaly detection model. We perform extensive experiments on five different deepfake datasets and show that our method can match and sometimes even exceed the performance of state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025 AI4MFDD Workshop</p></details> | None |

However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025.

In this context, effectively controlling Type I error rates ($\alpha$) without compromising the statistical power ($1-\beta$) of these systems can build trust and reduce costs related to false discoveries. The field of conformal anomaly detection emerges as a promising approach for providing respective statistical guarantees by model calibration. However, the dependency on calibration data poses practical limitations - especially within low-data regimes. In this work, we formally define and evaluate leave-one-out-, bootstrap-, and cross-conformal methods for anomaly detection, incrementing on methods from the field of conformal prediction. Looking beyond the classical inductive conformal anomaly detection, we demonstrate that derived methods for calculating resampling-conformal $p$-values strike a practical compromise between statistical efficiency (full-conformal) and computational efficiency (split-conformal) as they make more efficient use of available data. We validate derived methods and quantify their improvements for a range of one-class classifiers and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Knowledge Graph (ICKG)</p></details> | None |

However, while labeled anomalies are often scarce in emerging applications, existing supervised GAD approaches are either ineffective or not applicable when moved across graph domains due to distribution shifts and heterogeneous feature spaces. To address these challenges, we present AdaGraph-T3, a novel test-time training framework for cross-domain GAD. AdaGraph-T3 combines supervised and self-supervised learning during training while adapting to a new domain during test time using only self-supervised learning by leveraging a homophily-based affinity score that captures domain-invariant properties of anomalies. Our framework introduces four key innovations to cross-domain GAD: an effective self-supervision scheme, an attention-based mechanism that dynamically learns edge importance weights during message passing, domain-specific encoders for handling heterogeneous features, and class-aware regularization to address imbalance. Experiments across multiple cross-domain settings demonstrate that AdaGraph-T3 significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving average improvements of over 6.6% in AUROC and 7.9% in AUPRC compared to the best competing model.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures, accepted by the 103rd Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting, under review by Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board</p></details> | None |

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data such as lab test results capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative embeddings. These embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment.

| **[Cluster Aware Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09770v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection has gained significant attention across various domains, particularly in critical applications like fraud detection in e-commerce platforms and insider threat detection in cybersecurity. Usually, these data are composed of multiple types (e.g., user information and transaction records for financial data), thus exhibiting view heterogeneity. However, in the era of big data, the heterogeneity of views and the lack of label information pose substantial challenges to traditional approaches. Existing unsupervised graph anomaly detection methods often struggle with high-dimensionality issues, rely on strong assumptions about graph structures or fail to handle complex multi-view graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a cluster aware multi-view graph anomaly detection method, called CARE. Our approach captures both local and global node affinities by augmenting the graph's adjacency matrix with the pseudo-label (i.e., soft membership assignments) without any strong assumption about the graph. To mitigate potential biases from the pseudo-label, we introduce a similarity-guided loss. Theoretically, we show that the proposed similarity-guided loss is a variant of contrastive learning loss, and we present how this loss alleviates the bias introduced by pseudo-label with the connection to graph spectral clustering. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Specifically, CARE outperforms the second-best competitors by more than 39% on the Amazon dataset with respect to AUPRC and 18.7% on the YelpChi dataset with respect to AUROC. The code of our method is available at the GitHub link: https://github.com/zhenglecheng/CARE-demo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2025</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/zhenglecheng/CARE-demo) |
| **[VUS: Effective and Efficient Accuracy Measures for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13318v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task for time-series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. In contrast to other domains where AD mainly focuses on point-based anomalies (i.e., outliers in standalone observations), AD for time series is also concerned with range-based anomalies (i.e., outliers spanning multiple observations). Nevertheless, it is common to use traditional point-based information retrieval measures, such as Precision, Recall, and F-score, to assess the quality of methods by thresholding the anomaly score to mark each point as an anomaly or not. However, mapping discrete labels into continuous data introduces unavoidable shortcomings, complicating the evaluation of range-based anomalies. Notably, the choice of evaluation measure may significantly bias the experimental outcome. Despite over six decades of attention, there has never been a large-scale systematic quantitative and qualitative analysis of time-series AD evaluation measures. This paper extensively evaluates quality measures for time-series AD to assess their robustness under noise, misalignments, and different anomaly cardinality ratios. Our results indicate that measures producing quality values independently of a threshold (i.e., AUC-ROC and AUC-PR) are more suitable for time-series AD. Motivated by this observation, we first extend the AUC-based measures to account for range-based anomalies. Then, we introduce a new family of parameter-free and threshold-independent measures, Volume Under the Surface (VUS), to evaluate methods while varying parameters. We also introduce two optimized implementations for VUS that reduce significantly the execution time of the initial implementation. Our findings demonstrate that our four measures are significantly more robust in assessing the quality of time-series AD methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Survey of Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13256v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our increasingly interconnected world, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a crucial role in industries like healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing by combining physical processes with computing power. These systems, however, face many challenges, especially regarding security and system faults. Anomalies in CPS may indicate unexpected problems, from sensor malfunctions to cyber-attacks, and must be detected to prevent failures that can cause harm or disrupt services. This paper provides an overview of the different ways researchers have approached anomaly detection in CPS. We categorize and compare methods like machine learning, deep learning, mathematical models, invariant, and hybrid techniques. Our goal is to help readers understand the strengths and weaknesses of these methods and how they can be used to create safer, more reliable CPS. By identifying the gaps in current solutions, we aim to encourage future research that will make CPS more secure and adaptive in our increasingly automated world.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unveiling Multiple Descents in Unsupervised Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11703v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The phenomenon of double descent has challenged the traditional bias-variance trade-off in supervised learning but remains unexplored in unsupervised learning, with some studies arguing for its absence. In this study, we first demonstrate analytically that double descent does not occur in linear unsupervised autoencoders (AEs). In contrast, we show for the first time that both double and triple descent can be observed with nonlinear AEs across various data models and architectural designs. We examine the effects of partial sample and feature noise and highlight the importance of bottleneck size in influencing the double descent curve. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we uncover model-wise, epoch-wise, and sample-wise double descent across several data types and architectures. Our findings indicate that over-parameterized models not only improve reconstruction but also enhance performance in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and domain adaptation, highlighting their practical value in complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

This approach aims to leverage better feature relations by considering the data as coming from different modalities. These data are projected into a shared lower-dimensionality subspace which aims to preserve their inner characteristics. To supplement the previous work on this subject, we introduce novel multimodal graph-embedded regularizers that leverage graph information for every modality to enhance the training process, and we consider an improved training equation that allows us to maximize or minimize each modality according to the specified criteria. We apply this regularized graph-embedded model on a 3-modalities dataset after having generalized MS-SVDD algorithms to any number of modalities. To set up our application, we propose a whole preprocessing procedure to extract One-Class Classification training instances from time-bounded event time series that are used to evaluate both the reliability and earliness of our model for Event Detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, supplementary material</p></details> | None |
| **[Statistically Significant $k$NNAD by Selective Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12978v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised anomaly detection using the k-Nearest Neighbor method. The k-Nearest Neighbor Anomaly Detection (kNNAD) is a simple yet effective approach for identifying anomalies across various domains and fields. A critical challenge in anomaly detection, including kNNAD, is appropriately quantifying the reliability of detected anomalies. To address this, we formulate kNNAD as a statistical hypothesis test and quantify the probability of false detection using $p$-values. The main technical challenge lies in performing both anomaly detection and statistical testing on the same data, which hinders correct $p$-value calculation within the conventional statistical testing framework. To resolve this issue, we introduce a statistical hypothesis testing framework called Selective Inference (SI) and propose a method named Statistically Significant NNAD (Stat-kNNAD). By leveraging SI, the Stat-kNNAD method ensures that detected anomalies are statistically significant with theoretical guarantees. The proposed Stat-kNNAD method is applicable to anomaly detection in both the original feature space and latent feature spaces derived from deep learning models. Through numerical experiments on synthetic data and applications to industrial product anomaly detection, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the Stat-kNNAD method.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures | None |

| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection through Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12793v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in datasets is a longstanding problem in machine learning. In this context, anomalies are defined as a sample that significantly deviates from the remaining data. Meanwhile, optimal transport (OT) is a field of mathematics concerned with the transportation, between two probability measures, at least effort. In classical OT, the optimal transportation strategy of a measure to itself is the identity. In this paper, we tackle anomaly detection by forcing samples to displace its mass, while keeping the least effort objective. We call this new transportation problem Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport (MROT). Naturally, samples lying in low density regions of space will be forced to displace mass very far, incurring a higher transportation cost. We use these concepts to design a new anomaly score. Through a series of experiments in existing benchmarks, and fault detection problems, we show that our algorithm improves over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, under review</p></details> | None |

| **[Unifying Explainable Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12086v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems, prevalent in various scientific and engineering domains, are susceptible to anomalies that can significantly impact their performance and reliability. This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> | None |

| **[Component-aware Unsupervised Logical Anomaly Generation for Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11712v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is critical in industrial manufacturing for ensuring product quality and improving efficiency in automated processes. The scarcity of anomalous samples limits traditional detection methods, making anomaly generation essential for expanding the data repository. However, recent generative models often produce unrealistic anomalies increasing false positives, or require real-world anomaly samples for training. In this work, we treat anomaly generation as a compositional problem and propose ComGEN, a component-aware and unsupervised framework that addresses the gap in logical anomaly generation. Our method comprises a multi-component learning strategy to disentangle visual components, followed by subsequent generation editing procedures. Disentangled text-to-component pairs, revealing intrinsic logical constraints, conduct attention-guided residual mapping and model training with iteratively matched references across multiple scales. Experiments on the MVTecLOCO dataset confirm the efficacy of ComGEN, achieving the best AUROC score of 91.2%. Additional experiments on the real-world scenario of Diesel Engine and widely-used MVTecAD dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements when integrating simulated anomalies generated by ComGEN into automated production workflows.</p></details> |  | None |
