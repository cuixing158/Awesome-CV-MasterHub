To overcome this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, a 3D Anomaly Detection in Additive Manufacturing dataset, that is the first large-scale, industry-relevant dataset for RGB+3D surface defect detection in additive manufacturing. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 unique parts, captured with four industrial depth sensors, and includes 27,346 annotated defects across 12 categories along with 27,346 annotations of machine element features in 16 classes. 3D-ADAM is captured in a real industrial environment and as such reflects real production conditions, including variations in part placement, sensor positioning, lighting, and partial occlusion. Benchmarking state-of-the-art models demonstrates that 3D-ADAM presents substantial challenges beyond existing datasets. Validation through expert labelling surveys with industry partners further confirms its industrial relevance. By providing this benchmark, 3D-ADAM establishes a foundation for advancing robust 3D anomaly detection capable of meeting manufacturing demands.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HDM: Hybrid Diffusion Model for Unified Image Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19200v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image anomaly detection plays a vital role in applications such as industrial quality inspection and medical imaging, where it directly contributes to improving product quality and system reliability. However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is withdrawn owing to issues found in the experimental results</p></details> | None |
| **[Injecting Explainability and Lightweight Design into Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20201v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MOMEMTO: Patch-based Memory Gate Model in Time Series Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18751v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18386v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention. Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks. The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network. A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations. To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Single Image Is All You Need: Zero-Shot Anomaly Localization Without Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18354v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

| **[On Multi-entity, Multivariate Quickest Change Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18310v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Reputation Aggregation: A Robust Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Federated Learning in 5G and Edge Network Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18044v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments face severe security threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform label flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a novel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse adversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of clients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based geometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client based on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering of suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients, countering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine failures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+ records) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves robust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%, respectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach. This demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated learning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Detection of Misreporting Attacks on Software-Defined Immersive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18040v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to centrally control network infrastructure using a programmable middleware has made Software-Defined Networking (SDN) ideal for emerging applications, such as immersive environments. However, such flexibility introduces new vulnerabilities, such as switch misreporting led load imbalance, which in turn make such immersive environment vulnerable to severe quality degradation. In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning (ML)-based network anomaly detection framework that identifies such stealthy misreporting by capturing temporal inconsistencies in switch-reported loads, and thereby counter potentially catastrophic quality degradation of hosted immersive application. The detection system combines unsupervised anomaly scoring with supervised classification to robustly distinguish malicious behavior. Data collected from a realistic testbed deployment under both benign and adversarial conditions is used to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show that the framework achieves high recall in detecting misreporting behavior, making it effective for early and reliable detection in SDN environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 7 Images, will appear in CNSM 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Budgeted Adversarial Attack against Graph-Based Anomaly Detection in Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17987v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for anomaly detection in sensor networks, particularly when analyzing multivariate time series. In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |
| **[Medical priority fusion: achieving dual optimization of sensitivity and interpretability in nipt anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17924v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical machine learning faces a critical dilemma in high-stakes medical applications: algorithms achieving optimal diagnostic performance typically sacrifice the interpretability essential for physician decision-making, while interpretable methods compromise sensitivity in complex scenarios. This paradox becomes particularly acute in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), where missed chromosomal abnormalities carry profound clinical consequences yet regulatory frameworks mandate explainable AI systems. We introduce Medical Priority Fusion (MPF), a constrained multi-objective optimization framework that resolves this fundamental trade-off by systematically integrating Naive Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic through mathematically-principled weighted fusion under explicit medical constraints. Rigorous validation on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples characterized by extreme class imbalance (43.4:1 normal-to-abnormal ratio) employed stratified 5-fold cross-validation with comprehensive ablation studies and statistical hypothesis testing using McNemar's paired comparisons. MPF achieved simultaneous optimization of dual objectives: 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) with 80% interpretability score, significantly outperforming individual algorithms (McNemar's test, p < 0.001). The optimal fusion configuration achieved Grade A clinical deployment criteria with large effect size (d = 1.24), establishing the first clinically-deployable solution that maintains both diagnostic accuracy and decision transparency essential for prenatal care. This work demonstrates that medical-constrained algorithm fusion can resolve the interpretability-performance trade-off, providing a mathematical framework for developing high-stakes medical decision support systems that meet both clinical efficacy and explainability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 47 figures, publish to BIBM</p></details> | None |
| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v6)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tailored Transformation Invariance for Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17670v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is a subproblem within Computer Vision Anomaly Detection that has been receiving increasing amounts of attention due to its applicability to real-life scenarios. Recent research has focused on how to extract the most informative features, contrasting older kNN-based methods that use only pretrained features. These recent methods are much more expensive to train however and could complicate real-life application. Careful study of related work with regards to transformation invariance leads to the idea that popular benchmarks require robustness to only minor translations. With this idea we then formulate LWinNN, a local window based approach that creates a middle ground between kNN based methods that have either complete or no translation invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this small change increases accuracy considerably, while simultaneously decreasing both train and test time. This teaches us two things: first, the gap between kNN-based approaches and more complex state-of-the-art methodology can still be narrowed by effective usage of the limited data available. Second, our assumption of requiring only limited translation invariance highlights potential areas of interest for future work and the need for more spatially diverse benchmarks, for which our method can hopefully serve as a new baseline.

Consequently, the connection between academia and industry is of paramount importance. In this regard, we present the VAND 3.0 Challenge to showcase current progress in anomaly detection across different practical settings whilst addressing critical issues in the field. The challenge hosted two tracks, fostering the development of anomaly detection methods robust against real-world distribution shifts (Category 1) and exploring the capabilities of Vision Language Models within the few-shot regime (Category 2), respectively. The participants' solutions reached significant improvements over previous baselines by combining or adapting existing approaches and fusing them with novel pipelines. While for both tracks the progress in large pre-trained vision (language) backbones played a pivotal role for the performance increase, scaling up anomaly detection methods more efficiently needs to be addressed by future research to meet real-time and computational constraints on-site.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17472v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection commonly encounters in various domains like finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However, existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Anomaly Detection Under Normality Distribution Shift in Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17400v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is a critical task with broad real-world applications, including social networks, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. Most existing methods assume that normal patterns remain stable over time; however, this assumption often fails in practice due to the phenomenon we refer to as normality distribution shift (NDS), where normal behaviors evolve over time. Ignoring NDS can lead models to misclassify shifted normal instances as anomalies, degrading detection performance. To tackle this issue, we propose WhENDS, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method that aligns normal edge embeddings across time by estimating distributional statistics and applying whitening transformations. Extensive experiments on four widely-used dynamic graph datasets show that WhENDS consistently outperforms nine strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results and underscoring the importance of addressing NDS in dynamic graph anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17235v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is pivotal for numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing TSAD techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (ACM WSDM 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Long-term Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17068v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term trajectory anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the diversity and complex spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data. Existing trajectory anomaly detection methods fail to simultaneously consider both the high-level intentions of agents as well as the low-level details of the agent's navigation when analysing an agent's trajectories. This limits their ability to capture the full diversity of normal trajectories. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised trajectory anomaly detection method named Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion model (IHiD), which detects anomalies through both high-level intent evaluation and low-level sub-trajectory analysis. Our approach leverages Inverse Q Learning as the high-level model to assess whether a selected subgoal aligns with an agent's intention based on predicted Q-values. Meanwhile, a diffusion model serves as the low-level model to generate sub-trajectories conditioned on subgoal information, with anomaly detection based on reconstruction error. By integrating both models, IHiD effectively utilises subgoal transition knowledge and is designed to capture the diverse distribution of normal trajectories. Our experiments show that the proposed method IHiD achieves up to 30.2% improvement in anomaly detection performance in terms of F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus built using newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual datasets. DCAD-2000 includes over 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of data, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of current data cleaning methods, which rely on manual heuristic thresholds, we propose reframing data cleaning as an anomaly detection task. This dynamic filtering approach significantly enhances data quality by identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. We evaluate the quality of DCAD-2000 on the FineTask benchmark, demonstrating substantial improvements in multilingual dataset quality and task performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets.

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, capturing the complex and dynamic behaviours of individual traders poses significant challenges. Traditional classification and anomaly detection methods often establish a fixed risk boundary, failing to account for this complexity and dynamism. To tackle this issue, we propose a profit-aware risk ranker (PA-RiskRanker) that reframes the problem of identifying risky traders as a ranking task using Learning-to-Rank (LETOR) algorithms. Our approach features a Profit-Aware binary cross entropy (PA-BCE) loss function and a transformer-based ranker enhanced with a self-cross-trader attention pipeline. These components effectively integrate profit and loss (P&L) considerations into the training process while capturing intra- and inter-trader relationships. Our research critically examines the limitations of existing deep learning-based LETOR algorithms in trading risk management, which often overlook the importance of P&L in financial scenarios. By prioritising P&L, our method improves risky trader identification, achieving an 8.4% increase in F1 score compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) ranking models like Rankformer. Additionally, it demonstrates a 10%-17% increase in average profit compared to all benchmark models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)</p></details> | None |

Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs), BlockScan introduces a series of customized designs to effectively model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a novel modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized masked language modeling mechanism for pretraining the Transformer architecture, incorporating RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. Finally, we design a novel anomaly detection method based on the model outputs. We further provide theoretical analysis for the detection method of our system. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockScan's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockScan is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores.

Such data generation entails placing relevant objects of appropriate sizes each, at meaningful location in a scene canvas. There have been two classes of popular approaches to such generation: graphics based, and generative models-based. Optimization problems are known to lurk in the background for both these classes of approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practically useful manifestation of the classical Bin Packing problem in the context of generation of synthetic image data. We conjecture that the newly introduced problem, Resizable Anchored Region Packing(RARP) Problem, is NP-hard, and provide detailed arguments about our conjecture. As a first solution, we present a novel heuristic algorithm that is generic enough and therefore scales and packs arbitrary number of arbitrary-shaped regions at arbitrary locations, into an image canvas. The algorithm follows greedy approach to iteratively pack region pairs in a careful way, while obeying the optimization constraints. The algorithm is validated by an implementation that was used to generate a large-scale synthetic anomaly detection dataset, with highly varying degree of bin packing parameters per image sample i.e. RARP instance. Visual inspection of such data and checking of the correctness of each solution proves the effectiveness of our algorithm. With generative modeling being on rise in deep learning, and synthetic data generation poised to become mainstream, we expect that the newly introduced problem will be valued in the imaging scientific community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ISP-AD: A Large-Scale Real-World Dataset for Advancing Industrial Anomaly Detection with Synthetic and Real Defects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04997v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic visual inspection using machine learning plays a key role in achieving zero-defect policies in industry. Research on anomaly detection is constrained by the availability of datasets that capture complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical of production processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of their applicability in real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection Dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. Beyond benchmarking recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training strategy, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Experiments show that even a small amount of injected, weakly labeled real defects improves generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Overall, our findings indicate that model-free synthetic defects can provide a cold-start baseline, whereas a small number of injected real defects refine the decision boundary for previously unseen defect characteristics. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, Revised version submitted to the Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, the dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14911042</p></details> | None |

Leveraging complementary information from these different modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results.

| **[Two Is Better Than One: Aligned Representation Pairs for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18848v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection focuses on identifying samples that deviate from the norm. Discovering informative representations of normal samples is crucial to detecting anomalies effectively. Recent self-supervised methods have successfully learned such representations by employing prior knowledge about anomalies to create synthetic outliers during training. However, we often do not know what to expect from unseen data in specialized real-world applications. In this work, we address this limitation with our new approach Con$_2$, which leverages prior knowledge about symmetries in normal samples to observe the data in different contexts. Con$_2$ consists of two parts: Context Contrasting clusters representations according to their context, while Content Alignment encourages the model to capture semantic information by aligning the positions of normal samples across clusters. The resulting representation space allows us to detect anomalies as outliers of the learned context clusters. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach in extensive experiments on specialized medical datasets, outperforming competitive baselines based on self-supervised learning and pretrained models and presenting competitive performance on natural imaging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bt0zdsnWYc</p></details> | None |
| **[Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17662v5)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

| **[An Adversarial Robust Behavior Sequence Anomaly Detection Approach Based on Critical Behavior Unit Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15756v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential deep learning models (e.g., RNN and LSTM) can learn the sequence features of software behaviors, such as API or syscall sequences. However, recent studies have shown that these deep learning-based approaches are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Attackers can use adversarial samples to change the sequential characteristics of behavior sequences and mislead malware classifiers. In this paper, an adversarial robustness anomaly detection method based on the analysis of behavior units is proposed to overcome this problem. We extract related behaviors that usually perform a behavior intention as a behavior unit, which contains the representative semantic information of local behaviors and can be used to improve the robustness of behavior analysis. By learning the overall semantics of each behavior unit and the contextual relationships among behavior units based on a multilevel deep learning model, our approach can mitigate perturbation attacks that target local and large-scale behaviors. In addition, our approach can be applied to both low-level and high-level behavior logs (e.g., API and syscall logs). The experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the compared methods, which indicates that our approach has better performance against obfuscation attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder for Efficient and Sustainable Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06320v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, particularly water distribution systems, have increased due to rapid digitalization and the integration of IoT devices and industrial control systems (ICS). These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution. The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired consistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens the resilience of cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  | None |

The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71.

| **[Stabilizing Information Flow Entropy: Regularization for Safe and Interpretable Autonomous Driving Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16277v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep perception networks in autonomous driving traditionally rely on data-intensive training regimes and post-hoc anomaly detection, often disregarding fundamental information-theoretic constraints governing stable information processing. We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

A crucial element of these models is positional encoding, which allows transformers to capture the intrinsic sequential nature of time series data. This survey systematically examines existing techniques for positional encoding in transformer-based time series models. We investigate a variety of methods, including fixed, learnable, relative, and hybrid approaches, and evaluate their effectiveness in different time series classification tasks. Our findings indicate that data characteristics like sequence length, signal complexity, and dimensionality significantly influence method effectiveness. Advanced positional encoding methods exhibit performance gains in terms of prediction accuracy, however, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity. Furthermore, we outline key challenges and suggest potential research directions to enhance positional encoding strategies. By delivering a comprehensive overview and quantitative benchmarking, this survey intends to assist researchers and practitioners in selecting and designing effective positional encoding methods for transformer-based time series models.</p></details> |  | None |

However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 4th International Workshop on Spatio-Temporal Reasoning and Learning (STRL 2025) at the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |
| **[Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15033v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  | None |

A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents, and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution over time.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures | None |

First, most detection models usually consider centralized detection. Thus, all sensor data have to be uploaded to the control center for analysis, leading to a heavy traffic load. However, industrial sensor networks have high requirements for reliable and real-time communication. The heavy traffic load may cause communication delays or packets lost by corruption. Second, there are complex spatial and temporal features in industrial sensor data. The full extraction of such features plays a key role in improving detection performance.To solve the limitations above, this paper develops a cloud-edge collaborative data anomaly detection approach for industrial sensor networks that mainly consists of a sensor data detection model deployed at individual edges and a sensor data analysis model deployed in the cloud. The former is implemented using Gaussian and Bayesian algorithms, which effectively filter the substantial volume of sensor data generated during the normal operation of the industrial sensor network, thereby reducing traffic load. It only uploads all the sensor data to the sensor data analysis model for further analysis when the network is in an anomalous state. The latter based on GCRL is developed by inserting Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) into Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can effectively extract the spatial and temporal features of the sensor data for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally, RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step analytical outputs.

However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks. We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection.

| **[H-Alpha Anomalyzer: An Explainable Anomaly Detector for Solar H-Alpha Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14472v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream, producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling qualitative evaluation by domain experts.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Preference Isolation Forest for Structure-based Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10876v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of detecting anomalies as samples that do not conform to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. To this end, we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Pattern Recognition (2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[AD-DINOv3: Enhancing DINOv3 for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Anomaly-Aware Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14084v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution. Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects, rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we propose a novel foundation model ECHO that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with frequency positional embeddings, enabling spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. Moreover, the model incorporates sliding patches to support inputs of variable length without padding or cropping, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity and naturally extends to streaming scenarios. We evaluate our method on various kinds of machine signal datasets, including previous DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025), and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in machine signal anomaly detection and fault classification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model.

These advancements are pivotal for integrating intelligent, data-driven applications aimed at enhancing network reliability and operational autonomy through the introduction of cognitive capabilities, as exemplified by the emerging Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) standards. Despite its potential, the nascent nature of O-RAN technology presents challenges, primarily due to the absence of mature operational standards. This complicates the management of data and intelligent applications, particularly when integrating with traditional network management and operational support systems. Divergent vendor-specific design approaches further hinder migration and limit solution reusability. These challenges are compounded by a skills gap in telecommunications business-oriented engineering, which remains a key barrier to effective O-RAN deployment and intelligent application development. To address these challenges, Boldyn Networks developed a novel cloud-native data analytics platform, specifically designed to support scalable AI integration within O-RAN deployments. This platform underwent rigorous testing in real-world scenarios, and applied advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve operational efficiency and customer experience. Implementation involved adopting Development Operations (DevOps) practices, leveraging data lakehouse architectures tailored for AI applications, and employing sophisticated data engineering strategies. The platform successfully addresses connectivity challenges inherent in real-world offshore windfarm deployments using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for anomaly detection in network connectivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures.

Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in the proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC).

| **[TFLAG:Towards Practical APT Detection via Deviation-Aware Learning on Temporal Provenance Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06997v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) have grown increasingly complex and concealed, posing formidable challenges to existing Intrusion Detection Systems in identifying and mitigating these attacks. Recent studies have incorporated graph learning techniques to extract detailed information from provenance graphs, enabling the detection of attacks with greater granularity. Nevertheless, existing studies have largely overlooked the continuous yet subtle temporal variations in the structure of provenance graphs, which may correspond to surreptitious perturbation anomalies in ongoing APT attacks. Therefore, we introduce TFLAG, an advanced anomaly detection framework that for the first time integrates the structural dynamic extraction capabilities of temporal graph model with the anomaly delineation abilities of deviation networks to pinpoint covert attack activities in provenance graphs. This self-supervised integration framework leverages the graph model to extract neighbor interaction data under continuous temporal changes from historical benign behaviors within provenance graphs, while simultaneously utilizing deviation networks to accurately distinguish authentic attack activities from false positive deviations due to unexpected subtle perturbations. The experimental results indicate that, through a comprehensive design that utilizes both attribute and temporal information, it can accurately identify the time windows associated with APT attack behaviors without prior knowledge (e.g., labeled data samples), demonstrating superior accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods in differentiating between attack events and system false positive events.</p></details> |  | None |

This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound.

In such settings, inference latency poses a critical security risk, as delays may provide exploitable opportunities for attackers. However, many state-of-the-art ML-based HIDS solutions rely on computationally intensive architectures with high inference costs, limiting their practical deployment. This paper proposes LIGHT-HIDS, a lightweight machine learning framework that combines a compressed neural network feature extractor trained via Deep Support Vector Data Description (DeepSVDD) with an efficient novelty detection model. This hybrid approach enables the learning of compact, meaningful representations of normal system call behavior for accurate anomaly detection. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that LIGHT-HIDS consistently enhances detection accuracy while reducing inference time by up to 75x compared to state-of-the-art methods. These findings highlight its effectiveness and scalability as a machine learning-based solution for real-time host intrusion detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 24th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> | None |
| **[A Domain Knowledge Informed Approach for Anomaly Detection of Electric Vehicle Interior Sounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13390v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing</p></details> | None |
| **[Real-time, Adaptive Radiological Anomaly Detection and Isotope Identification Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10715v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are integral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search operations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, these methods face great challenges in handling high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a Down-sampling Network (Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and 84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 Accepted, 9 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

Normal fine-grained tissue variability such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12787v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2) the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation, connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods.</p></details> | 10 pages,8 figures | None |

A cross-modal deep metric learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify different time series features. The inner product of principal component direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection speed, and strong robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Emerging vision foundation models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations. In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and significant class imbalance. Our results highlight the efficacy of utilizing pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging.

These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes, while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns, while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a single unified network.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Attackers can create adversarial samples that alter the sequence characteristics of behavior sequences to deceive malware classifiers. The existing methods for generating adversarial samples typically involve deleting or replacing crucial behaviors in the original data sequences, or inserting benign behaviors that may violate the behavior constraints. However, these methods that directly manipulate sequences make adversarial samples difficult to implement or apply in practice. In this paper, we propose an adversarial attack approach based on Deep Q-Network and a heuristic backtracking search strategy, which can generate perturbation sequences that satisfy practical conditions for successful attacks. Subsequently, we utilize a novel transformation approach that maps modifications back to the source code, thereby avoiding the need to directly modify the behavior log sequences. We conduct an evaluation of our approach, and the results confirm its effectiveness in generating adversarial samples from real-world malware behavior sequences, which have a high success rate in evading anomaly detection models. Furthermore, our approach is practical and can generate adversarial samples while maintaining the functionality of the modified software.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems Based on Cross-Domain Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11786v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used in industry, and their security and stability are very important. Once the ICS is attacked, it may cause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in ICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication networks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing the security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of different domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs are correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by analyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach based on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can learn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within different domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent the behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint features of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave differently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to identify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it also presents major cybersecurity issues such as cyberattacks affecting industrial processes. Federated Learning (FL) combined with time-series analysis is a promising cyberattack detection mechanism proposed in the literature. However, the fact of having a single point of failure and network bottleneck are critical challenges that need to be tackled. Thus, this article explores the benefits of the Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in terms of cyberattack detection and resource consumption. The work presents TemporalFED, a software module for detecting anomalies in industrial environments using FL paradigms and time series. TemporalFED incorporates three components: Time Series Conversion, Feature Engineering, and Time Series Stationary Conversion. To evaluate TemporalFED, it was deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL framework. Then, a pool of experiments measured the detection performance and resource consumption in a chemical gas industrial environment with different time-series configurations, FL paradigms, and topologies. The results showcase the superiority of the configuration utilizing DFL and Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) paradigms, along with a fully connected topology, which achieved the best performance in anomaly detection. Regarding resource consumption, the configuration without feature engineering employed less bandwidth, CPU, and RAM than other configurations.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data. Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues.

However, existing benchmarks are limited to either frame-level or video-level tasks, restricting a holistic view of model generalization. This work first introduces a softmax-based frame allocation strategy that prioritizes anomaly-dense segments while maintaining full-video coverage, enabling balanced sampling across temporal scales. Building on this process, we construct two complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring task.Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused sampling over uniform and random baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages in IEEE double-column format, 1 figure, 5 tables.

| **[CRoC: Context Refactoring Contrast for Graph Anomaly Detection with Limited Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12278v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> | None |

This study presents a novel integrated framework combining state-of-the-art large language models (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with advanced prompt engineering techniques and multimodal data fusion for comprehensive reservoir analysis. The framework implements domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with over 50,000 petroleum engineering documents, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot learning for rapid field adaptation. Multimodal integration processes seismic interpretations, well logs, and production data through specialized AI models with vision transformers. Field validation across 15 diverse reservoir environments demonstrates exceptional performance: 94.2% reservoir characterization accuracy, 87.6% production forecasting precision, and 91.4% well placement optimization success rate. The system achieves sub-second response times while maintaining 96.2% safety reliability with no high-risk incidents during evaluation. Economic analysis reveals 62-78% cost reductions (mean 72%) relative to traditional methods with 8-month payback period. Few-shot learning reduces field adaptation time by 72%, while automated prompt optimization achieves 89% improvement in reasoning quality. The framework processed real-time data streams with 96.2% anomaly detection accuracy and reduced environmental incidents by 45%. We provide detailed experimental protocols, baseline comparisons, ablation studies, and statistical significance testing to ensure reproducibility. This research demonstrates practical integration of cutting-edge AI technologies with petroleum domain expertise for enhanced operational efficiency, safety, and economic performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GTHNA: Local-global Graph Transformer with Memory Reconstruction for Holistic Node Anomaly Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10869v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |

Although their software relies on strict verification and validation processes following well-established best-practices and certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to residual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at design-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores run-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the resilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European Train Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual control flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time monitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly localization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link relevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a reference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its capability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 6th International Conference on Reliability, Safety, and Security of Railway Systems (RSSRail2025)</p></details> | None |

Exploiting the intrinsic geometry of optimal transport, we construct a multiscale transform applicable to both absolutely continuous and discrete measures. Central to our approach is a refinement operator based on McCann's interpolants, which preserves the geodesic structure of measure flows and serves as an upsampling mechanism. Building on this, we introduce the optimality number, a scalar that quantifies deviations of a sequence from Wasserstein geodesicity across scales, enabling the detection of irregular dynamics and anomalies. We establish key theoretical guarantees, including stability of the transform and geometric decay of coefficients, ensuring robustness and interpretability of the multiscale representation. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our methodology through numerical experiments: denoising and anomaly detection in Gaussian flows, analysis of point cloud dynamics under vector fields, and the multiscale characterization of neural network learning trajectories.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images, and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D anomaly detection.</p></details> | Page 14, 5 pictures | None |

With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust, privacy-preserving EVCS security.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches require lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass, and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis: vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we first demonstrate analytically that double descent does not occur in linear unsupervised autoencoders (AEs). In contrast, we show for the first time that both double and triple descent can be observed with nonlinear AEs across various data models and architectural designs. We examine the effects of partial sample and feature noise and highlight the importance of bottleneck size in influencing the double descent curve. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we uncover model-wise, epoch-wise, and sample-wise double descent across several data types and architectures. Our findings indicate that over-parameterized models not only improve reconstruction but also enhance performance in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and domain adaptation, highlighting their practical value in complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series data.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, unsupervised anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous from normal instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WSDM 2026. 11 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 1 algorithm, 8 datasets, contextual anomaly detection framework for tabular data</p></details> | None |

| **[Agents of Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08535v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

Recognizing this limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy.

Associative Knowledge Graphs (AKGs) offer a promising approach by leveraging sparse graph structures to encode sequences. The objective was to develop a method for sequence storage and retrieval using AKGs that maintain high memory capacity and context-based retrieval accuracy while introducing algorithms for efficient element ordering. The study utilized Sequential Structural Associative Knowledge Graphs (SSAKGs). These graphs encode sequences as transitive tournaments with nodes representing objects and edges defining the order. Four ordering algorithms were developed and tested: Simple Sort, Node Ordering, Enhanced Node Ordering, and Weighted Edges Node Ordering. The evaluation was conducted on synthetic datasets consisting of random sequences of varying lengths and distributions, and real-world datasets, including sentence-based sequences from the NLTK library and miRNA sequences mapped symbolically with a window-based approach. Metrics such as precision, sensitivity, and specificity were employed to assess performance. SSAKGs exhibited quadratic growth in memory capacity relative to graph size. This study introduces a novel structural approach for sequence storage and retrieval. Key advantages include no training requirements, flexible context-based reconstruction, and high efficiency in sparse memory graphs. With broad applications in computational neuroscience and bioinformatics, the approach offers scalable solutions for sequence-based memory tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Beyond Rebalancing: Benchmarking Binary Classifiers Under Class Imbalance Without Rebalancing Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07605v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification, particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance. The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2nd edition of the Workshop in AI and Finance at ECAI-2025</p></details> | None |

As opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly interpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate HyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five datasets from real-world systems. The experimental results show that on average HyGLAD outperforms existing deep-learning methods while being an order of magnitude more efficient in training and inference (single CPU vs GPU). Precision improved by 1.2x and recall by 1.3x compared to the second-best baseline.</p></details> |  | None |

Embodying proactive mitigation improves safety and operational continuity. This paper presents a multimodal anomaly detection and mitigation system that integrates vision-language models and large language models to identify and report hazardous situations and conflicts in real-time. The proposed system enables robots to perceive, interpret, report, and if possible respond to urban and environmental anomalies through proactive detection mechanisms and automated mitigation actions. A key contribution in this paper is the integration of Hazardous and Conflict states into the robot's decision-making framework, where each anomaly type can trigger specific mitigation strategies.

| **[A Survey of Generalization of Graph Anomaly Detection: From Transfer Learning to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06609v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications. To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICKG 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Impact of Labeling Inaccuracy and Image Noise on Tooth Segmentation in Panoramic Radiographs using Federated, Centralized and Local Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06553v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints, heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI. We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation (additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set. From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at 0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777). Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD: 1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD: 1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrastive Self-Supervised Network Intrusion Detection using Augmented Negative Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06550v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity. While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing self-supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR), 2025.

| **[CAPMix: Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection Based on Abnormal Assumptions with Dual-Space Mixup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06419v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task, particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated training data.

Traditional log analysis methods for anomaly detection and root cause analysis rely heavily on expert knowledge or fully supervised learning models, both of which require extensive labeled data and significant human effort. To address these challenges, we propose ALPHA, the first Active Learning Pipeline for Human-free log Analysis. ALPHA integrates semantic embedding, clustering-based representative sampling, and large language model (LLM)-assisted few-shot annotation to automate the anomaly detection process. The LLM annotated labels are propagated across clusters, enabling large-scale training of an anomaly detector with minimal supervision. To enhance the annotation accuracy, we propose a two-step few-shot refinement strategy that adaptively selects informative prompts based on the LLM's observed error patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world log datasets demonstrate that ALPHA achieves detection accuracy comparable to fully supervised methods while mitigating human efforts in the loop. ALPHA also supports interpretable analysis through LLM-driven root cause explanations in the post-detection stage. These capabilities make ALPHA a scalable and cost-efficient solution for truly automated log-based anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 44th IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC 2025)</p></details> | None |

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

This work proposes two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score (4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection, yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy, efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest (PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods, affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Reliability Engineering & System Safety journal</p></details> | None |

While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality, more experiments</p></details> | None |

Although defective samples can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1\% on MVTec AD).</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional supervised learning methods typically require large amounts of labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines AutoEncoders for anomaly detection with active learning to iteratively enhance APT detection. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, our method reduces labeling costs while improving detection accuracy, enabling the model to effectively learn with minimal data and reduce reliance on extensive manual labeling. We present a comprehensive formulation of the Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and demonstrate how the active learning loop progressively enhances the model's performance. The framework is evaluated on real-world, imbalanced provenance trace data from the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks account for just 0.004\% of the data. The datasets, which cover multiple operating systems including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, are tested in two attack scenarios.

In New Zealand, housing quality has historically been poor, with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating contributing to widespread energy hardship. Recent reforms, including the Warmer Kiwi Homes program, Healthy Homes Standards, and H1 Building Code upgrades, have delivered health and comfort improvements, yet challenges persist. Many retrofits remain partial, data on household performance are limited, and decision-making support for homeowners is fragmented. This study presents the design and evaluation of an AI-powered decision-support tool for residential energy efficiency in New Zealand. The prototype, developed using Python and Streamlit, integrates data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades) into a modular dashboard. Fifteen domain experts, including building scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners, tested the tool through semi-structured interviews. Results show strong usability (M = 4.3), high value of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive perceptions of its potential to complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool demonstrates how AI can translate national policies into personalized, household-level guidance, bridging the gap between funding, standards, and practical decision-making. Its significance lies in offering a replicable framework for reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate goals. Future development should focus on carbon metrics, tariff modeling, integration with national datasets, and longitudinal trials to assess real-world adoption.</p></details> |  | None |

Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> | None |

Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows. This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface. KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, we propose a homomorphic encryption scheme for dynamic controllers that automatically discloses the residue signal for anomaly detection, while keeping all other signals private. To this end, we characterize the zero-dynamics of an encrypted dynamic system over a finite field of integers and incorporate it into a Learning With Errors (LWE) based scheme. We then present a method to further utilize the disclosed residue signal for implementing dynamic controllers over encrypted data, which does not involve re-encryption even when they have non-integer state matrices.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Extended Histogram-based Outlier Score (EHBOS)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05719v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histogram-Based Outlier Score (HBOS) is a widely used outlier or anomaly detection method known for its computational efficiency and simplicity. However, its assumption of feature independence limits its ability to detect anomalies in datasets where interactions between features are critical. In this paper, we propose the Extended Histogram-Based Outlier Score (EHBOS), which enhances HBOS by incorporating two-dimensional histograms to capture dependencies between feature pairs. This extension allows EHBOS to identify contextual and dependency-driven anomalies that HBOS fails to detect. We evaluate EHBOS on 17 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse anomaly detection scenarios. EHBOS outperforms HBOS on several datasets, particularly those where feature interactions are critical in defining the anomaly structure, achieving notable improvements in ROC AUC. These results highlight that EHBOS can be a valuable extension to HBOS, with the ability to model complex feature dependencies. EHBOS offers a powerful new tool for anomaly detection, particularly in datasets where contextual or relational anomalies play a significant role.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Machine Learning-Driven Anomaly Detection for 5G O-RAN Performance Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03290v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN) elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures. We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints. This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI | None |

Existing approaches are predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks. Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits, with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain environments.</p></details> |  | None |

The widespread use of open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences. In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack: a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large, representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SPIE: Sensors + Imaging, Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications II</p></details> | None |

In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight | None |

Recently, Aizpurua et al. demonstrated explainable anomaly detection with matrix product states on a discrete-valued cyber-security task, using quantum-inspired methods to gain insight into the learned model and detected anomalies. Here, we extend this framework to real-valued data domains. We furthermore introduce tree tensor networks for the task of explainable anomaly detection. We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for publication at IEEE QAI 2025</p></details> | None |

It has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on industrial images.</p></details> |  | None |

This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes, LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450. The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98 for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode (constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends, action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL, LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures | None |

This innovative method revolutionizes healthcare by facilitating early disease detection and tailored care, particularly in chronic disease management, where IoMT automates treatments based on real-time health data collection. Nonetheless, its benefits are countered by significant security challenges that endanger the lives of its users due to the sensitivity and value of the processed data, thereby attracting malicious interests. Moreover, the utilization of wireless communication for data transmission exposes medical data to interception and tampering by cybercriminals. Additionally, anomalies may arise due to human error, network interference, or hardware malfunctions. In this context, anomaly detection based on Machine Learning (ML) is an interesting solution, but it comes up against obstacles in terms of explicability and privacy protection. To address these challenges, a new framework for Intrusion Detection Systems is introduced, leveraging Artificial Neural Networks for intrusion detection while utilizing Federated Learning for privacy preservation. Additionally, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods are incorporated to enhance model explanation and interpretation. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated and compared with centralized approaches using multiple datasets containing network and medical data, simulating various attack types impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical and physiological data. The results offer compelling evidence that the FL method performs comparably to the centralized method, demonstrating high performance. Additionally, it affords the dual advantage of safeguarding privacy and providing model explanation while adhering to ethical principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables, journal paper</p></details> | None |

The best-performing logical anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

However, their ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work, we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33 real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at https://github.com/USC-Melady/TSAIA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/USC-Melady/TSAIA) |

Currently, manual inspection methods are the default approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast, state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Elsevier MLWA</p></details> | None |
| **[Unsupervised Identification and Replay-based Detection (UIRD) for New Category Anomaly Detection in ECG Signal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01512v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals, the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore, to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.</p></details> |  | None |

This scenario highlights the need for solutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic and changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for network flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning capabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal behavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data, which is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is constantly changing and labeled data is scarce. The model was implemented using the River library with a One-Class SVM and evaluated on the NF-UNSW-NB15 dataset and its extended version v2, which contain network flows labeled with different attack categories. The results show an accuracy above 98%, a false positive rate below 3.1%, and a recall of 100% in the most advanced version of the dataset. In addition, the low processing time per flow (<0.033 ms) demonstrates the feasibility of the approach for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations: insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency, sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency. By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores, we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective comparison of evaluation metrics.

Since tabular data contains complex interdependencies among features, it presents a unique challenge for adversarial samples which must maintain coherence and respect these interdependencies to remain indistinguishable from benign data. Moreover, existing attack evaluation metrics-such as the success rate, perturbation magnitude, and query count-fail to account for this challenge. To address those gaps, we propose a technique for perturbing dependent features while preserving sample coherence. In addition, we introduce Class-Specific Anomaly Detection (CSAD), an effective novel anomaly detection approach, along with concrete metrics for assessing the quality of tabular adversarial attacks. CSAD evaluates adversarial samples relative to their predicted class distribution, rather than a broad benign distribution. It ensures that subtle adversarial perturbations, which may appear coherent in other classes, are correctly identified as anomalies. We integrate SHAP explainability techniques to detect inconsistencies in model decision-making, extending CSAD for SHAP-based anomaly detection. Our evaluation incorporates both anomaly detection rates with SHAP-based assessments to provide a more comprehensive measure of adversarial sample quality. We evaluate various attack strategies, examining black-box query-based and transferability-based gradient attacks across four target models. Experiments on benchmark tabular datasets reveal key differences in the attacker's risk and effort and attack quality, offering insights into the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs faced by attackers and defenders. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on adversarial attacks and defense development in the tabular domain.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity.

This work presents a build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated, annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.</p></details> | 26 pages, 15 figures | None |

Large language models (LLMs), with strong generalization and reasoning capabilities, offer new opportunities for automated spectral interpretation, but their potential in this domain remains largely untapped. This study introduces LUMIR (LLM-driven Unified agent framework for Multi-task Infrared spectroscopy Reasoning), an agent based framework designed to achieve accurate infrared spectral analysis under low data conditions. LUMIR integrates a structured literature knowledge base, automated preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictive modeling into a unified pipeline. By mining peer reviewed spectroscopy studies, it identifies validated preprocessing and feature derivation strategies, transforms spectra into low dimensional representations, and applies few-shot prompts for classification, regression, and anomaly detection. The framework was validated on diverse datasets, including the publicly available Milk near-infrared dataset, Chinese medicinal herbs, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium(CRP) with different storage durations, an industrial wastewater COD dataset, and two additional public benchmarks, Tecator and Corn. Across these tasks, LUMIR achieved performance comparable to or surpassing established machine learning and deep learning models, particularly in resource limited settings. This work demonstrates that combining structured literature guidance with few-shot learning enables robust, scalable, and automated spectral interpretation. LUMIR establishes a new paradigm for applying LLMs to infrared spectroscopy, offering high accuracy with minimal labeled data and broad applicability across scientific and industrial domains.</p></details> | 19 pages | None |

In this study, we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that leverages the convex hull (CH) property of a dataset by exploiting the observation that OOD samples marginally increase the CH's volume compared to in-distribution samples. Thus, we establish a decision boundary between OOD and in-distribution data by iteratively computing the CH's volume as samples are removed, stopping when such removal does not significantly alter the CH's volume. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against seven widely used anomaly detection methods across ten datasets, demonstrating performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Furthermore, we introduce a computationally efficient criterion for identifying datasets where the proposed method outperforms existing SOTA approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer, Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised, and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures, their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust methods to enhance IT system reliability.</p></details> | Dissertation | None |

Recently, the research community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.

Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third, we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD) |

This work presents a lightweight dual-detection framework combining statistical thresholding and machine learning (ML) for real-time anomaly detection. By simulating anomalies via delays and ciphertext corruption, we collect timing and data features to evaluate two strategies: (1) a statistical threshold method based on execution time and (2) a Random Forest classifier trained on block-level anomalies. Implemented on CPU and FPGA (PYNQ-Z1), our results show that the ML approach outperforms static thresholds in accuracy, while maintaining real-time feasibility on embedded platforms. The framework operates without modifying AES internals or relying on hardware performance counters. This makes it especially suitable for low-power, resource-constrained systems where detection accuracy and computational efficiency must be balanced.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted at Supercomputing (SC'25)</p></details> | None |

This enables experimentation and examination of counterfactuals, simulating the consequences of decisions in real time. However, the DT accuracy relies on timely updates that maintain alignment with the real system. We can distinguish between: (i) pull-updates, which follow a request from the DT to the sensors, to decrease its drift from the physical state; (ii) push-updates, which are sent directly by the sensors since they represent urgent information, such as anomalies. In this work, we devise a push-pull scheduler (PPS) medium access framework, which dynamically allocates the communication resources used for these two types of updates. Our scheme strikes a balance in the trade-off between DT alignment in normal conditions and anomaly reporting, optimizing resource usage and reducing the drift age of incorrect information (AoII) by over 20% with respect to state-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same anomaly detection guarantees, as well as reducing the worst-case anomaly detection AoII from 70 ms to 20 ms when considering a 1 ms average drift AoII constraint.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> | None |

However, maintaining consistent application performance in serverless environments remains a significant challenge. The dynamic and transient nature of serverless functions makes it difficult to distinguish between benign and anomalous behavior, which in turn undermines the effectiveness of traditional anomaly detection methods. These conventional approaches, designed for stateful and long-running services, struggle in serverless settings where executions are short-lived, functions are isolated, and observability is limited. In this first comprehensive vision paper on anomaly detection for serverless systems, we systematically explore the unique challenges posed by this paradigm, including the absence of persistent state, inconsistent monitoring granularity, and the difficulty of correlating behaviors across distributed functions. We further examine a range of threats that manifest as anomalies, from classical Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to serverless-specific threats such as Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) and cold start amplification. Building on these observations, we articulate a research agenda for next-generation detection frameworks that address the need for context-aware, multi-source data fusion, real-time, lightweight, privacy-preserving, and edge-cloud adaptive capabilities. Through the identification of key research directions and design principles, we aim to lay the foundation for the next generation of anomaly detection in cloud-native, serverless ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, Preprint accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)</p></details> | None |
| **[Quantum enhanced ensemble GANs for anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21438v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.</p></details> |  | None |

PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Localization of Partially Fake Speech: Metrics and Out-of-Domain Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03468v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial audio deepfake localization poses unique challenges and remain underexplored compared to full-utterance spoofing detection. While recent methods report strong in-domain performance, their real-world utility remains unclear. In this analysis, we critically examine the limitations of current evaluation practices, particularly the widespread use of Equal Error Rate (EER), which often obscures generalization and deployment readiness. We propose reframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and advocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior. Specifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on the in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the LlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our reproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%) but better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This highlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to models that perform poorly in real-world scenarios. It also suggests that while deep learning models can be effective on in-domain data, they generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios, failing to detect novel synthetic samples and misclassifying unfamiliar bona fide audio. Finally, we observe that adding more bona fide or fully synthetic utterances to the training data often degrades performance, whereas adding partially fake utterances improves it.</p></details> | APSIPA 2025 | None |

Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM (Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop, continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic, context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model, validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00115v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.</p></details> |  | None |

These facilities contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction, parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system, we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data, completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous data.</p></details> |  | None |

The RAN leverages numerous key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate system performance, generating vast amounts of data each second. This immense data volume can make troubleshooting and accurate diagnosis of performance anomalies more difficult. Furthermore, the highly dynamic nature of RAN performance demands adaptive methodologies capable of capturing temporal dependencies to detect anomalies reliably. In response to these challenges, we introduce \textbf{RANGAN}, an anomaly detection framework that integrates a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a transformer architecture. To enhance the capability of capturing temporal dependencies within the data, RANGAN employs a sliding window approach during data preprocessing. We rigorously evaluated RANGAN using the publicly available RAN performance dataset from the Spotlight project \cite{sun-2024}. Experimental results demonstrate that RANGAN achieves promising detection accuracy, notably attaining an F1-score of up to $83\%$ in identifying network contention issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in the 2025 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)</p></details> | None |

Recent graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks, but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs, preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier methods.</p></details> |  | None |

While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models. However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial: existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate, underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[When AIOps Become "AI Oops": Subverting LLM-driven IT Operations via Telemetry Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06394v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex software systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and remediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings. In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system. To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance. Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.</p></details> | v0.2 | None |
| **[Anomaly Detection in Networked Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20076v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nodes' interconnections on a social network often reflect their dependencies and information-sharing behaviors. Nevertheless, abnormal nodes, which significantly deviate from most of the network concerning patterns or behaviors, can lead to grave consequences. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient online learning algorithms that robustly learn users' preferences while simultaneously detecting anomalies. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm to address this problem. Through network knowledge, the method characterizes the users' preferences and residuals of feature information. By learning and analyzing these preferences and residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each user and simultaneously detects anomalies. We rigorously prove an upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm and experimentally compare it with several state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Synthetic Image Detection via Spectral Gaps of QC-RBIM Nishimori Bethe-Hessian Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19698v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advance of deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion networks now produces images that are virtually indistinguishable from genuine photographs, undermining media forensics and biometric security. Supervised detectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial post-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level statistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired, model-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a community-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are first extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature vector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities are transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature, producing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum exhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is present. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack such gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male versus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic counterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled synthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves over 94% accuracy. Spectral analysis shows multiple well separated gaps for real image sets and a collapsed spectrum for generated ones. Our contributions are threefold: a novel LDPC graph construction that embeds deep image features, an analytical link between Nishimori temperature RBIM and the Bethe-Hessian spectrum providing a Bayes optimal detection criterion; and a practical, unsupervised synthetic image detector robust to new generative architectures. Future work will extend the framework to video streams and multi-class anomaly detection.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures | None |

Generally, meaningful information can be stored in the hidden layers of the trained FNN, and the TU implementation is one tractable recipe to extract buried information by means of the Topological Data Analysis. We explicate the concept of the TU and the numerical procedures. Then, for a concrete demonstration of the performance test, we employ the Neutron Star data used for inference of the equation of state (EoS). For the training dataset consisting of the input (Neutron Star data) and the output (EoS parameters), we can compare the inferred EoSs and the exact answers to classify the data with the label $k$. The subdataset with $k=0$ leads to the normal inference for which the inferred EoS approximates the answer well, while the subdataset with $k=1$ ends up with the unsuccessful inference. Once the TU is prepared based on the $k$-labled subdatasets, we introduce the cross-TU to quantify the uncertainty of characterizing the $k$-labeled data with the label $j$. The anomaly or unsuccessful inference is correctly detected if the cross-TU for $j=k=1$ is smaller than that for $j=0$ and $k=1$. In our numerical experiment, for various input data, we calculate the cross-TU and estimate the performance of Anomaly Detection. We find that performance depends on FNN hyperparameters, and the success rate of Anomaly Detection exceeds $90\%$ in the best case. We finally discuss further potential of the TU application to retrieve the information hidden in the trained FNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

Existing reconstruction methods often rely on frozen pre-trained encoders, which limits adaptation to domain-specific features and reduces localization accuracy. Prototype-based learning offers interpretability and clustering benefits but suffers from prototype collapse, where few prototypes dominate training, harming diversity and generalization. To address this, we propose a unified framework combining a trainable encoder with prototype-guided reconstruction and a novel Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss. The trainable encoder, enhanced by a momentum branch, enables stable domain-adaptive feature learning. A lightweight Prototype Extractor mines informative normal prototypes to guide the decoder via attention for precise reconstruction. Our loss enforces balanced prototype use through diversity constraints and per-prototype normalization, effectively preventing collapse.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been extensively studied to enhance IoT security, and machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) show considerable promise for detecting malicious activity. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by poor adaptability to emerging threats and the issue of catastrophic forgetting during continuous learning. To address these challenges, we propose CITADEL, a self-supervised continual learning framework designed to extract robust representations from benign data while preserving long-term knowledge through optimized memory consolidation mechanisms. CITADEL integrates a tabular-to-image transformation module, a memory-aware masked autoencoder for self-supervised representation learning, and a novelty detection component capable of identifying anomalies without dependence on labeled attack data. Our design enables the system to incrementally adapt to emerging behaviors while retaining its ability to detect previously observed threats. Experiments on multiple intrusion datasets demonstrate that CITADEL achieves up to a 72.9% improvement over the VAE-based lifelong anomaly detector (VLAD) in key detection and retention metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in dynamic IoT environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE IoTJ</p></details> | None |

While anomaly-detection-based weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA) strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.</p></details> |  | None |

Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying. We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases, allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences, addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model. We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.</p></details> |  | None |

The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.</p></details> |  | None |

These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added references, corrected typos, grammar check, authors updated</p></details> | None |

However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures | None |

Since it is impossible to enumerate all failures for a given task, we learn from successful executions of the task to detect visual anomalies during runtime. Our method learns to predict the motions that occur during the nominal execution of a task, including camera and robot body motion. A probabilistic U-Net architecture is used to learn to predict optical flow, and the robot's kinematics and 3D model are used to model camera and body motion. The errors between the observed and predicted motion are used to calculate an anomaly score. We evaluate our method on a dataset of a robot placing a book on a shelf, which includes anomalies such as falling books, camera occlusions, and robot disturbances. We find that modeling camera and body motion, in addition to the learning-based optical flow prediction, results in an improvement of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.752 to 0.804, and the area under the precision-recall curve from 0.467 to 0.549.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> | None |

Traditional methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates, and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning, called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

This work introduces a novel context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance.

Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault detection. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep transfer learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to a new one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault detection in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault detection in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Change of phrasing to fault detection, including title change, and minor revisions.

In this paper, we focus on one centralized and one decentralized problem of active hypothesis testing in the presence of an eavesdropper. For the centralized problem including a single legitimate agent, we present a new framework based on deep NeuroEvolution (NE), whereas, for the decentralized problem, we develop a novel NE-based method for solving collaborative multi-agent tasks, which, interestingly, maintains all computational benefits of our single-agent NE-based scheme. To further reduce the computational complexity of the latter scheme, a novel multi-agent joint NE and pruning framework is also designed. The superiority of the proposed NE-based evasive active hypothesis testing schemes over conventional active hypothesis testing policies, as well as learning-based methods, is validated through extensive numerical investigations in an example use case of anomaly detection over wireless sensor networks. It is demonstrated that the proposed joint optimization and pruning framework achieves nearly identical performance with its unpruned counterpart, while removing a very large percentage of redundant deep neural network weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at an IEEE journal, shorter conference version presented at IEEE ICC 2024</p></details> | None |

This approach has proven essential in domains such as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention, even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data, Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.</p></details> |  | None |

To achieve FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD) framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm. Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD setting.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and 92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled.

Existing methods typically follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings, regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.</p></details> |  | None |

Each model is used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Comprehensive Review of Denial of Wallet Attacks in Serverless Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19284v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack poses a unique and growing threat to serverless architectures that rely on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) models, exploiting the cost structure of pay-as-you-go billing to financially burden application owners. Unlike traditional Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which aim to exhaust resources and disrupt service availability, DoW attacks focus on escalating costs without impacting service operation. This review traces the evolution of DoW research, from initial awareness and attack classification to advancements in detection and mitigation strategies. Key developments include the categorisation of attack types-such as Blast DDoW, Continual Inconspicuous DDoW, and Background Chained DDoW-and the creation of simulation tools like DoWTS, which enable safe experimentation and data generation. Recent advancements highlight machine learning approaches, including systems like Gringotts and DoWNet, which leverage deep learning and anomaly detection to identify malicious traffic patterns. Although substantial progress has been made, challenges persist, notably the lack of real-world data and the need for adaptive billing models. This is the first comprehensive literature review dedicated strictly to Denial of Wallet attacks, providing an in-depth analysis of their financial impacts, attack techniques, mitigation strategies, and detection mechanisms within serverless computing. The paper also presents the first detailed examination of simulation and data generation tools used for DoW research, addressing a critical gap in existing cybersecurity literature. By synthesising these key areas, this study serves as a foundational resource for future research and industry efforts in securing pay-as-you-go cloud environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Modeling Irregular Astronomical Time Series with Neural Stochastic Delay Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17521v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Astronomical time series from large-scale surveys like LSST are often irregularly sampled and incomplete, posing challenges for classification and anomaly detection. We introduce a new framework based on Neural Stochastic Delay Differential Equations (Neural SDDEs) that combines stochastic modeling with neural networks to capture delayed temporal dynamics and handle irregular observations. Our approach integrates a delay-aware neural architecture, a numerical solver for SDDEs, and mechanisms to robustly learn from noisy, sparse sequences. Experiments on irregularly sampled astronomical data demonstrate strong classification accuracy and effective detection of novel astrophysical events, even with partial labels. This work highlights Neural SDDEs as a principled and practical tool for time series analysis under observational constraints.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Mutual Information Surprise: Rethinking Unexpectedness in Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17403v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in autonomous experimentation have demonstrated remarkable physical capabilities, yet their cognitive control remains limited--often relying on static heuristics or classical optimization. A core limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking. Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-S...</summary><p>Pre-Submission Version</p></details> | None |

| **[A Decoupled LOB Representation Framework for Multilevel Manipulation Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17086v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets are critical to global economic stability, yet trade-based manipulation (TBM) often undermines their fairness. Spoofing, a particularly deceptive TBM strategy, exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns that have not been adequately modeled. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation pipeline with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel anomalies and the contributions of key components, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex sequential data. Our code will be released later at this URL.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Photorealistic Dataset and Vision-Based Algorithm for Anomaly Detection During Proximity Operations in Lunar Orbit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20435v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NASA's forthcoming Lunar Gateway space station, which will be uncrewed most of the time, will need to operate with an unprecedented level of autonomy. One key challenge is enabling the Canadarm3, the Gateway's external robotic system, to detect hazards in its environment using its onboard inspection cameras. This task is complicated by the extreme and variable lighting conditions in space. In this paper, we introduce the visual anomaly detection and localization task for the space domain and establish a benchmark based on a synthetic dataset called ALLO (Anomaly Localization in Lunar Orbit). We show that state-of-the-art visual anomaly detection methods often fail in the space domain, motivating the need for new approaches. To address this, we propose MRAD (Model Reference Anomaly Detection), a statistical algorithm that leverages the known pose of the Canadarm3 and a CAD model of the Gateway to generate reference images of the expected scene appearance. Anomalies are then identified as deviations from this model-generated reference. On the ALLO dataset, MRAD surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms, achieving an AP score of 62.1% at the pixel level and an AUROC score of 74.9% at the image level. Given the low tolerance for risk in space operations and the lack of domain-specific data, we emphasize the need for novel, robust, and accurate anomaly detection methods to handle the challenging visual conditions found in lunar orbit and beyond.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Unsupervised Automata Learning via Discrete Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14111v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automata learning is a successful tool for many application domains such as robotics and automatic verification. Typically, automata learning techniques operate in a supervised learning setting (active or passive) where they learn a finite state machine in contexts where additional information, such as labeled system executions, is available. However, other settings, such as learning from unlabeled data - an important aspect in machine learning - remain unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a given multi-set of unlabeled words. We show that this problem is computationally hard and develop three learning algorithms based on constraint optimization. Moreover, we introduce novel regularization schemes for our optimization problems that improve the overall interpretability of our DFAs. Using a prototype implementation, we demonstrate practical feasibility in the context of unsupervised anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Such semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e., reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICPM 2025, 8 pages, 2 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Beyond Human-prompting: Adaptive Prompt Tuning with Semantic Alignment for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16157v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding. In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework. This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32% Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH) often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures | None |

| **[GRASPED: Graph Anomaly Detection using Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Decoder (Full Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15633v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However, they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters, thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper accepted for publication at the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> | None |

| **[EvoFormer: Learning Dynamic Graph-Level Representations with Structural and Temporal Bias Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15378v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However, existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies, resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias, EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends, effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and temporal biases.</p></details> |  | None |
