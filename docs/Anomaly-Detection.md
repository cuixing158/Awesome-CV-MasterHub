| **[Tracing and Metrics Design Patterns for Monitoring Cloud-native Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02991v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observability helps ensure the reliability and maintainability of cloud-native applications. As software architectures become increasingly distributed and subject to change, it becomes a greater challenge to diagnose system issues effectively, often having to deal with fragmented observability and more difficult root cause analysis. This paper builds upon our previous work and introduces three design patterns that address key challenges in monitoring cloud-native applications. Distributed Tracing improves visibility into request flows across services, aiding in latency analysis and root cause detection, Application Metrics provides a structured approach to instrumenting applications with meaningful performance indicators, enabling real-time monitoring and anomaly detection, and Infrastructure Metrics focuses on monitoring the environment in which the system is operated, helping teams assess resource utilization, scalability, and operational health. These patterns are derived from industry practices and observability frameworks and aim to offer guidance for software practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the EuroPLoP 2025 proceedings</p></details> | None |
| **[A Novel Unified Lightweight Temporal-Spatial Transformer Approach for Intrusion Detection in Drone Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02711v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks. Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability, efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net, a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records, demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[CostFilter-AD: Enhancing Anomaly Detection through Matching Cost Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01476v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures, 20 tables, accepted by Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning ( ICML 2025 ), link: https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/46359</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD) |
| **[Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs): highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity, and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fine-grained Abnormality Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10289v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods show remarkable success in prompting large pre-trained vision-language models to detect anomalies in a target dataset without using any dataset-specific training or demonstration. However, these methods often focus on crafting/learning prompts that capture only coarse-grained semantics of abnormality, e.g., high-level semantics like "damaged", "imperfect", or "defective" objects. They therefore have limited capability in recognizing diverse abnormality details that deviate from these general abnormal patterns in various ways. To address this limitation, we propose FAPrompt, a novel framework designed to learn Fine-grained Abnormality Prompts for accurate ZSAD. To this end, a novel Compound Abnormality Prompt learning (CAP) module is introduced in FAPrompt to learn a set of complementary, decomposed abnormality prompts, where abnormality prompts are enforced to model diverse abnormal patterns derived from the same normality semantic. On the other hand, the fine-grained abnormality patterns can be different from one dataset to another. To enhance the cross-dataset generalization, another novel module, namely Data-dependent Abnormality Prior learning (DAP), is introduced in FAPrompt to learn a sample-wise abnormality prior from abnormal features of each test image to dynamically adapt the abnormality prompts to individual test images. Comprehensive experiments on 19 real-world datasets, covering both industrial defects and medical anomalies, demonstrate that FAPrompt substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image- and pixel-level ZSAD tasks.

| **[Secure and Scalable Blockchain Voting: A Comparative Framework and the Role of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05865v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain technology offers a promising foundation for modernizing E-Voting systems by enhancing transparency, decentralization, and security. Yet, real-world adoption remains limited due to persistent challenges such as scalability constraints, high computational demands, and complex privacy requirements. This paper presents a comparative framework for analyzing blockchain-based E-Voting architectures, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic protocols. We examine the limitations of prevalent models like Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake, and propose optimization strategies that include hybrid consensus, lightweight cryptography, and decentralized identity management. Additionally, we explore the novel role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in smart contract generation, anomaly detection, and user interaction. Our findings offer a foundation for designing secure, scalable, and intelligent blockchain-based E-Voting systems suitable for national-scale deployment. This work lays the groundwork for building an end-to-end blockchain E-Voting prototype enhanced by LLM-guided smart contract generation and validation, supported by a systematic framework and simulation-based analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |
| **[PUL-Inter-slice Defender: An Anomaly Detection Solution for Distributed Slice Mobility Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02236v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G) networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator; PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, journal paper</p></details> | None |
| **[Unlocking Vision-Language Models for Video Anomaly Detection via Fine-Grained Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02155v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, video anomaly detection</p></details> | None |
| **[ReTabAD: A Benchmark for Restoring Semantic Context in Tabular Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02060v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and (2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Normality Calibration in Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02014v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components, anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.</p></details> | 17 pages | None |
| **[Moon: A Modality Conversion-based Efficient Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01970v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Foundation Visual Encoders Are Secretly Few-Shot Anomaly Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01934v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection.

| **[Learning Time-Series Representations by Hierarchical Uniformity-Tolerance Latent Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01658v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations. Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings. Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> | None |
| **[A Visual Diagnostics Framework for District Heating Data: Enhancing Data Quality for AI-Driven Heat Consumption Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00872v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks, sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Energ...</summary><p>Energy Informatics.Academy Conference 2025 (EI.A 2025), 3-6 December 2025, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p></details> | None |
| **[TShape: Rescuing Machine Learning Models from Complex Shapelet Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00680v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is critical for maintaining the reliability of modern IT infrastructures, where complex anomalies frequently arise in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we present TShape, a novel framework designed to address the challenges in industrial time series anomaly detection. Existing methods often struggle to detect shapelet anomalies that manifest as complex shape deviations, which appear obvious to human experts but prove challenging for machine learning algorithms. TShape introduces a patch-wise dual attention mechanism with multi-scale convolution to model intricate sub-sequence variations by balancing local, fine-grained shape features with global contextual dependencies. Our extensive evaluation on five diverse benchmarks demonstrates that TShape outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving an average 10\% F1 score improvement in anomaly detection. Additionally, ablation studies and attention visualizations confirm the essential contributions of each component, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of TShape to complex shapelet shapes in time series data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Robust Spatiotemporally Contiguous Anomaly Detection Using Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00460v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies. Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Improved Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Unsupervised Subspace Modeling in the Signed Cumulative Distribution Transform Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00148v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures. Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Revealing the temporal dynamics of antibiotic anomalies in the infant gut microbiome with neural jump ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00087v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in irregularly sampled multi-variate time-series is challenging, especially in data-scarce settings. Here we introduce an anomaly detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates, and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[MissionHD: Hyperdimensional Refinement of Distribution-Deficient Reasoning Graphs for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14746v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-generated reasoning graphs, referred to as mission-specific graphs (MSGs), are increasingly used for video anomaly detection (VAD) and recognition (VAR). These MSGs are novel artifacts: they often exhibit skewed connectivity and lack large-scale datasets for pre-training, which makes existing graph structure refinement (GSR) methods ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose HDC-constrained Graph Structure Refinement (HDC-GSR), a paradigm that leverages hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to optimize decodable graph representations without relying on structural-distribution learning. Building on this paradigm, we introduce MissionHD, an HDC framework that encodes graphs with constrained graph-neural operations, aligns them directly with downstream task loss, and decodes refined structures. Experiments on VAD/VAR benchmarks demonstrate that MissionHD-refined graphs consistently improve performance, establishing HDC-GSR as an effective pre-processing step for structured reasoning in video anomaly tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DEPTHOR++: Robust Depth Enhancement from a Real-World Lightweight dToF and RGB Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26498v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training. Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average. On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices. Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures | None |
| **[PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e., automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement.

DL-based AAD systems improve security by enabling real-time threat detection in SDN-IoT networks. However, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate input data or exploit model weaknesses, significantly degrading detection accuracy. Existing research lacks a systematic analysis of adversarial vulnerabilities specific to DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT environments. This SoK study introduces a structured adversarial threat model and a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks, categorising them into data, model, and hybrid-level threats. Unlike previous studies, we systematically evaluate white, black, and grey-box attack strategies across popular benchmark datasets. Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference causing the most significant drop. C&W and DeepFool achieve high evasion success rates. However, adversarial training enhances robustness, and its high computational overhead limits the real-time deployment of SDN-IoT applications. We propose adaptive countermeasures, including real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and explainable AI-driven security frameworks. By integrating structured threat models, this study offers a more comprehensive approach to attack categorisation, impact assessment, and defence evaluation than previous research. Our work highlights critical vulnerabilities in existing DL-based AAD models and provides practical recommendations for improving resilience, interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance DL-based AAD security in SDN-IoT networks, offering a systematic adversarial threat model and conceptual defence evaluation based on prior empirical studies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their ever-growing volume introduces substantial storage overhead and complicates troubleshooting. Existing approaches typically adopt a sample-before-analysis paradigm: even when guided by data heuristics, they inevitably discard failure-related information and hinder transparency in diagnosing system behavior. To address this, we introduce UniSage, the first unified framework to sample both traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware paradigm. Instead of discarding data upfront, UniSagefirst performs lightweight and multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) on the complete data stream. This process yields fine-grained, service-level diagnostic insights that guide a dual-pillar sampling strategy for handling both normal and anomalous scenarios: an analysis-guided sampler prioritizes data implicated by RCA, while an edge-case-based sampler ensures rare but critical behaviors are captured. Together, these pillars ensure comprehensive coverage of critical signals without excessive redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniSage significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. At a 2.5% sampling rate, it captures 56.5% of critical traces and 96.25% of relevant logs, while improving the accuracy (AC@1) of downstream root cause analysis by 42.45%. Furthermore, its efficient pipeline processes 10 minutes of telemetry data in under 5 seconds, demonstrating its practicality for production environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Anomaly detection for generic failure monitoring in robotic assembly, screwing and manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26308v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies. Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Stealthy Yet Effective: Distribution-Preserving Backdoor Attacks on Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26032v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[UniMMAD: Unified Multi-Modal and Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via MoE-Driven Feature Decompression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25934v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover, reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage, multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact, general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE, which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities, and 66 classes. The source code will be available at https://github.com/yuanzhao-CVLAB/UniMMAD.</p></details> | manuscript | [Code Link](https://github.com/yuanzhao-CVLAB/UniMMAD) |

Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[Towards Convexity in Anomaly Detection: A New Formulation of SSLM with Unique Optimal Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23774v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An unsolved issue in widely used methods such as Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and Small Sphere and Large Margin SVM (SSLM) for anomaly detection is their nonconvexity, which hampers the analysis of optimal solutions in a manner similar to SVMs and limits their applicability in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel convex SSLM formulation which has been demonstrated to revert to a convex quadratic programming problem for hyperparameter values of interest. Leveraging the convexity of our method, we derive numerous results that are unattainable with traditional nonconvex approaches. We conduct a thorough analysis of how hyperparameters influence the optimal solution, pointing out scenarios where optimal solutions can be trivially found and identifying instances of ill-posedness. Most notably, we establish connections between our method and traditional approaches, providing a clear determination of when the optimal solution is unique--a task unachievable with traditional nonconvex methods. We also derive the nu-property to elucidate the interactions between hyperparameters and the fractions of support vectors and margin errors in both positive and negative classes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RDD: Pareto Analysis of the Rate-Distortion-Distinguishability Trade-off](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24805v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can be distinguished from each other.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures | None |
| **[Generalist Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via Distillation to Two Heterogeneous Student Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24448v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ScatterAD: Temporal-Topological Scattering Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24414v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection.

| **[AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24378v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[United We Stand: Towards End-to-End Log-based Fault Diagnosis via Interactive Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24364v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log-based fault diagnosis is essential for maintaining software system availability. However, existing fault diagnosis methods are built using a task-independent manner, which fails to bridge the gap between anomaly detection and root cause localization in terms of data form and diagnostic objectives, resulting in three major issues: 1) Diagnostic bias accumulates in the system; 2) System deployment relies on expensive monitoring data; 3) The collaborative relationship between diagnostic tasks is overlooked. Facing this problems, we propose a novel end-to-end log-based fault diagnosis method, Chimera, whose key idea is to achieve end-to-end fault diagnosis through bidirectional interaction and knowledge transfer between anomaly detection and root cause localization. Chimera is based on interactive multi-task learning, carefully designing interaction strategies between anomaly detection and root cause localization at the data, feature, and diagnostic result levels, thereby achieving both sub-tasks interactively within a unified end-to-end framework. Evaluation on two public datasets and one industrial dataset shows that Chimera outperforms existing methods in both anomaly detection and root cause localization, achieving improvements of over 2.92% - 5.00% and 19.01% - 37.09%, respectively. It has been successfully deployed in production, serving an industrial cloud platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 (Research Track)</p></details> | None |

However, existing deep learning-based methods represent a black box for service providers, making it impossible for providers to understand how these methods detect anomalies, thereby hindering trust and deployment in real production environments. To address this issue, this paper defines a trustworthiness metric, diagnostic faithfulness, for models to gain service providers' trust, based on surveys of SREs at a major cloud provider. We design two evaluation tasks: attention-based root cause localization and event perturbation. Empirical studies demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly in diagnostic faithfulness. Consequently, we propose FaithLog, a faithful log-based anomaly detection system, which achieves faithfulness through a carefully designed causality-guided attention mechanism and adversarial consistency learning. Evaluation results on two public datasets and one industrial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in diagnostic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2025 (NIER Track)</p></details> | None |

Yet public datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000 time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions (median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection, and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables.

| **[ResAD++: Towards Class Agnostic Anomaly Detection via Residual Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23741v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD), where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features. In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art competing methods and also surpassing ResAD.

Classical units, including Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for resource constrained deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables</p></details> | None |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.</p></details> | under review | None |
| **[Convolutional Set Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22889v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor, typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet (https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer) |

However, existing acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then, we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC 0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational cost.</p></details> |  | None |

While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and generalization. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.</p></details> | Under Review | None |
| **[Extracting Actionable Insights from Building Energy Data using Vision LLMs on Wavelet and 3D Recurrence Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21934v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Online Resource Allocation with Average Budget Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11425v5)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of online resource allocation with average budget constraints. At each time point the decision maker makes an irrevocable decision of whether to accept or reject a request before the next request arrives with the goal to maximize the cumulative rewards. In contrast to existing literature requiring the total resource consumption is below a certain level, we require the average resource consumption per accepted request does not exceed a given threshold. This problem can be casted as an online knapsack problem with exogenous random budget replenishment, and can find applications in various fields such as online anomaly detection, sequential advertising, and per-capita public service providers. We start with general arrival distributions and show that a simple policy achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such a regret growing rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over accept arrivals, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget safety buffers. It turns out that a little more safety can greatly enhance efficiency -- small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. From a practical perspective, we extend the policy to the scenario with continuous arrival distributions, time-dependent information structures, as well as unknown $T$. We conduct both synthetic experiments and empirical applications on a time series data of New York City taxi passengers to validate the performance of our proposed policies.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21190v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.</p></details> | 24 pages | None |

To address these issues, we propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach addresses the critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets.

This paper introduces DGSP-GCN (Dynamic Graph Similarity Prediction based on Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning-based framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with dynamic graph signal processing techniques to provide a unified solution for evaluating generative models and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks. DGSP-GCN assesses how well a generated network snapshot matches the expected temporal evolution, incorporating an attention mechanism to improve embedding quality and capture dynamic structural changes. The approach was tested on five real-world datasets: WikiMath, Chickenpox, PedalMe, MontevideoBus, and MetraLa. Results show that DGSP-GCN outperforms baseline methods, such as time series regression and random similarity assignment, achieving the lowest error rates (MSE of 0.0645, MAE of 0.1781, RMSE of 0.2507).

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction. However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1) coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning, then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.</p></details> | under review | None |

This study introduces autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native cloud simulations.

| **[Unsupervised Log Anomaly Detection with Few Unique Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08951v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces a novel method for detecting anomalies within log data from control system nodes at the European XFEL accelerator. Effective anomaly detection is crucial for providing operators with a clear understanding of each node's availability, status, and potential problems, thereby ensuring smooth accelerator operation. Traditional and learning-based anomaly detection methods face significant limitations due to the sequential nature of these logs and the lack of a rich, node-specific text corpus. To address this, we propose an approach utilizing word embeddings to represent log entries and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the typical sequential patterns of these embeddings for individual nodes. Anomalies are identified by scoring individual log entries based on a probability ratio: this ratio compares the likelihood of the log sequence including the new entry against its likelihood without it, effectively measuring how well the new entry fits the established pattern. High scores indicate potential anomalies that deviate from the node's routine behavior. This method functions as a warning system, alerting operators to irregular log events that may signify underlying issues, thereby facilitating proactive intervention.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Improved Time Series Anomaly Detection by Applying Structural Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20184v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

Therefore, we have proposed a novel framework for short-term anomaly detection that uses an SDN-based DT. Using a comprehensive dataset, time-aware labeling of features, and a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models, we propose a novel SD-TWIN-based anomaly detection algorithm. According to the performance of a new real-time SD-TWIN deployment, the GPU- accelerated LightGBM model is particularly effective, achieving a balance of high recall and strong classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE Globecom Workshops-TwinNetApp</p></details> | None |

For small datasets, a memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection.

However, their increasing adoption raises serious security concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs) exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.</p></details> |  | None |

We present Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems.

Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on two subsets (FD001, FD003) of the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan engine degradation. TDC-AE machtes LSTMs and outperforms Transformers while achieving a nearly 100x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is withdrawn owing to issues found in the experimental results</p></details> | None |

However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection, enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations, with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space, neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying movement network, e.g., road or transit networks. The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings that reflect the spatial layout of the road network. A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations. To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that emphasizes high-confidence deviations. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Single Image Is All You Need: Zero-Shot Anomaly Localization Without Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18354v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 1 table.

| **[On Multi-entity, Multivariate Quickest Change Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18310v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Reputation Aggregation: A Robust Defense Mechanism for Adversarial Federated Learning in 5G and Edge Network Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18044v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) in 5G and edge network environments face severe security threats from adversarial clients. Malicious participants can perform label flipping, inject backdoor triggers, or launch Sybil attacks to corrupt the global model. This paper introduces Hybrid Reputation Aggregation (HRA), a novel robust aggregation mechanism designed to defend against diverse adversarial behaviors in FL without prior knowledge of the attack type. HRA combines geometric anomaly detection with momentum-based reputation tracking of clients. In each round, it detects outlier model updates via distance-based geometric analysis while continuously updating a trust score for each client based on historical behavior. This hybrid approach enables adaptive filtering of suspicious updates and long-term penalization of unreliable clients, countering attacks ranging from backdoor insertions to random noise Byzantine failures. We evaluate HRA on a large-scale proprietary 5G network dataset (3M+ records) and the widely used NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018 benchmark under diverse adversarial attack scenarios. Experimental results reveal that HRA achieves robust global model accuracy of up to 98.66% on the 5G dataset and 96.60% on NF-CSE-CIC-IDS2018, outperforming state-of-the-art aggregators such as Krum, Trimmed Mean, and Bulyan by significant margins. Our ablation studies further demonstrate that the full hybrid system achieves 98.66% accuracy, while the anomaly-only and reputation-only variants drop to 84.77% and 78.52%, respectively, validating the synergistic value of our dual-mechanism approach. This demonstrates HRA's enhanced resilience and robustness in 5G/edge federated learning deployments, even under significant adversarial conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, such flexibility introduces new vulnerabilities, such as switch misreporting led load imbalance, which in turn make such immersive environment vulnerable to severe quality degradation. In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning (ML)-based network anomaly detection framework that identifies such stealthy misreporting by capturing temporal inconsistencies in switch-reported loads, and thereby counter potentially catastrophic quality degradation of hosted immersive application. The detection system combines unsupervised anomaly scoring with supervised classification to robustly distinguish malicious behavior. Data collected from a realistic testbed deployment under both benign and adversarial conditions is used to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show that the framework achieves high recall in detecting misreporting behavior, making it effective for early and reliable detection in SDN environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 7 Images, will appear in CNSM 2025</p></details> | None |

In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.</p></details> | 12 pages | None |

This paradox becomes particularly acute in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), where missed chromosomal abnormalities carry profound clinical consequences yet regulatory frameworks mandate explainable AI systems. We introduce Medical Priority Fusion (MPF), a constrained multi-objective optimization framework that resolves this fundamental trade-off by systematically integrating Naive Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic through mathematically-principled weighted fusion under explicit medical constraints. Rigorous validation on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples characterized by extreme class imbalance (43.4:1 normal-to-abnormal ratio) employed stratified 5-fold cross-validation with comprehensive ablation studies and statistical hypothesis testing using McNemar's paired comparisons. MPF achieved simultaneous optimization of dual objectives: 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) with 80% interpretability score, significantly outperforming individual algorithms (McNemar's test, p < 0.001). The optimal fusion configuration achieved Grade A clinical deployment criteria with large effect size (d = 1.24), establishing the first clinically-deployable solution that maintains both diagnostic accuracy and decision transparency essential for prenatal care. This work demonstrates that medical-constrained algorithm fusion can resolve the interpretability-performance trade-off, providing a mathematical framework for developing high-stakes medical decision support systems that meet both clinical efficacy and explainability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 47 figures, publish to BIBM</p></details> | None |
| **[Interpreting GNN-based IDS Detections Using Provenance Graph Structural Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00934v6)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security-critical tasks. To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human interpretable. We show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the Fidelity+/Fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, we incorporate the precision/recall metric, where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth, and we designed a human actionability metric based on graph traversal distance. On real-world Fileless and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25%/1.4x higher Fidelity+, precision, recall, and actionability (where higher values are better), and 12% lower Fidelity- (where lower values are better) when compared against SOTA GNN explainers.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Tailored Transformation Invariance for Industrial Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17670v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is a subproblem within Computer Vision Anomaly Detection that has been receiving increasing amounts of attention due to its applicability to real-life scenarios. Recent research has focused on how to extract the most informative features, contrasting older kNN-based methods that use only pretrained features. These recent methods are much more expensive to train however and could complicate real-life application. Careful study of related work with regards to transformation invariance leads to the idea that popular benchmarks require robustness to only minor translations. With this idea we then formulate LWinNN, a local window based approach that creates a middle ground between kNN based methods that have either complete or no translation invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this small change increases accuracy considerably, while simultaneously decreasing both train and test time. This teaches us two things: first, the gap between kNN-based approaches and more complex state-of-the-art methodology can still be narrowed by effective usage of the limited data available. Second, our assumption of requiring only limited translation invariance highlights potential areas of interest for future work and the need for more spatially diverse benchmarks, for which our method can hopefully serve as a new baseline.

Consequently, the connection between academia and industry is of paramount importance. In this regard, we present the VAND 3.0 Challenge to showcase current progress in anomaly detection across different practical settings whilst addressing critical issues in the field. The challenge hosted two tracks, fostering the development of anomaly detection methods robust against real-world distribution shifts (Category 1) and exploring the capabilities of Vision Language Models within the few-shot regime (Category 2), respectively. The participants' solutions reached significant improvements over previous baselines by combining or adapting existing approaches and fusing them with novel pipelines. While for both tracks the progress in large pre-trained vision (language) backbones played a pivotal role for the performance increase, scaling up anomaly detection methods more efficiently needs to be addressed by future research to meet real-time and computational constraints on-site.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods assume that normal patterns remain stable over time; however, this assumption often fails in practice due to the phenomenon we refer to as normality distribution shift (NDS), where normal behaviors evolve over time. Ignoring NDS can lead models to misclassify shifted normal instances as anomalies, degrading detection performance. To tackle this issue, we propose WhENDS, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method that aligns normal edge embeddings across time by estimating distributional statistics and applying whitening transformations. Extensive experiments on four widely-used dynamic graph datasets show that WhENDS consistently outperforms nine strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results and underscoring the importance of addressing NDS in dynamic graph anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in multivariate time series anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD. PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing TSAD techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (ACM WSDM 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Long-term Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17068v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term trajectory anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the diversity and complex spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data. Existing trajectory anomaly detection methods fail to simultaneously consider both the high-level intentions of agents as well as the low-level details of the agent's navigation when analysing an agent's trajectories. This limits their ability to capture the full diversity of normal trajectories. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised trajectory anomaly detection method named Intention-aware Hierarchical Diffusion model (IHiD), which detects anomalies through both high-level intent evaluation and low-level sub-trajectory analysis. Our approach leverages Inverse Q Learning as the high-level model to assess whether a selected subgoal aligns with an agent's intention based on predicted Q-values. Meanwhile, a diffusion model serves as the low-level model to generate sub-trajectories conditioned on subgoal information, with anomaly detection based on reconstruction error. By integrating both models, IHiD effectively utilises subgoal transition knowledge and is designed to capture the diverse distribution of normal trajectories. Our experiments show that the proposed method IHiD achieves up to 30.2% improvement in anomaly detection performance in terms of F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures | None |

In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus built using newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual datasets. DCAD-2000 includes over 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of data, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of current data cleaning methods, which rely on manual heuristic thresholds, we propose reframing data cleaning as an anomaly detection task. This dynamic filtering approach significantly enhances data quality by identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. We evaluate the quality of DCAD-2000 on the FineTask benchmark, demonstrating substantial improvements in multilingual dataset quality and task performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets.

While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, capturing the complex and dynamic behaviours of individual traders poses significant challenges. Traditional classification and anomaly detection methods often establish a fixed risk boundary, failing to account for this complexity and dynamism. To tackle this issue, we propose a profit-aware risk ranker (PA-RiskRanker) that reframes the problem of identifying risky traders as a ranking task using Learning-to-Rank (LETOR) algorithms. Our approach features a Profit-Aware binary cross entropy (PA-BCE) loss function and a transformer-based ranker enhanced with a self-cross-trader attention pipeline. These components effectively integrate profit and loss (P&L) considerations into the training process while capturing intra- and inter-trader relationships. Our research critically examines the limitations of existing deep learning-based LETOR algorithms in trading risk management, which often overlook the importance of P&L in financial scenarios. By prioritising P&L, our method improves risky trader identification, achieving an 8.4% increase in F1 score compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) ranking models like Rankformer. Additionally, it demonstrates a 10%-17% increase in average profit compared to all benchmark models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS)</p></details> | None |

Our methodology involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality and efficiency.

Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs), BlockScan introduces a series of customized designs to effectively model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a novel modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized masked language modeling mechanism for pretraining the Transformer architecture, incorporating RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. Finally, we design a novel anomaly detection method based on the model outputs. We further provide theoretical analysis for the detection method of our system. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockScan's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockScan is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work sets a new benchmark for applying Transformer-based approaches in blockchain data analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

Such data generation entails placing relevant objects of appropriate sizes each, at meaningful location in a scene canvas. There have been two classes of popular approaches to such generation: graphics based, and generative models-based. Optimization problems are known to lurk in the background for both these classes of approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practically useful manifestation of the classical Bin Packing problem in the context of generation of synthetic image data. We conjecture that the newly introduced problem, Resizable Anchored Region Packing(RARP) Problem, is NP-hard, and provide detailed arguments about our conjecture. As a first solution, we present a novel heuristic algorithm that is generic enough and therefore scales and packs arbitrary number of arbitrary-shaped regions at arbitrary locations, into an image canvas. The algorithm follows greedy approach to iteratively pack region pairs in a careful way, while obeying the optimization constraints. The algorithm is validated by an implementation that was used to generate a large-scale synthetic anomaly detection dataset, with highly varying degree of bin packing parameters per image sample i.e. RARP instance. Visual inspection of such data and checking of the correctness of each solution proves the effectiveness of our algorithm. With generative modeling being on rise in deep learning, and synthetic data generation poised to become mainstream, we expect that the newly introduced problem will be valued in the imaging scientific community.</p></details> |  | None |

Research on anomaly detection is constrained by the availability of datasets that capture complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical of production processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of their applicability in real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection Dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. Beyond benchmarking recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training strategy, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Experiments show that even a small amount of injected, weakly labeled real defects improves generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Overall, our findings indicate that model-free synthetic defects can provide a cold-start baseline, whereas a small number of injected real defects refine the decision boundary for previously unseen defect characteristics. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, Revised version submitted to the Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, the dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14911042</p></details> | None |

Leveraging complementary information from these different modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results.

Quantum Computing (QC) enables more efficient data manipulation through the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. In this paper, we present a novel approach combining quantum and classical machine learning techniques to explore the impact of quantum properties for anomaly detection in Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data.

| **[Two Is Better Than One: Aligned Representation Pairs for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18848v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection focuses on identifying samples that deviate from the norm. Discovering informative representations of normal samples is crucial to detecting anomalies effectively. Recent self-supervised methods have successfully learned such representations by employing prior knowledge about anomalies to create synthetic outliers during training. However, we often do not know what to expect from unseen data in specialized real-world applications. In this work, we address this limitation with our new approach Con$_2$, which leverages prior knowledge about symmetries in normal samples to observe the data in different contexts. Con$_2$ consists of two parts: Context Contrasting clusters representations according to their context, while Content Alignment encourages the model to capture semantic information by aligning the positions of normal samples across clusters. The resulting representation space allows us to detect anomalies as outliers of the learned context clusters. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach in extensive experiments on specialized medical datasets, outperforming competitive baselines based on self-supervised learning and pretrained models and presenting competitive performance on natural imaging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bt0zdsnWYc</p></details> | None |
| **[Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17662v5)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

| **[An Adversarial Robust Behavior Sequence Anomaly Detection Approach Based on Critical Behavior Unit Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15756v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential deep learning models (e.g., RNN and LSTM) can learn the sequence features of software behaviors, such as API or syscall sequences. However, recent studies have shown that these deep learning-based approaches are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Attackers can use adversarial samples to change the sequential characteristics of behavior sequences and mislead malware classifiers. In this paper, an adversarial robustness anomaly detection method based on the analysis of behavior units is proposed to overcome this problem. We extract related behaviors that usually perform a behavior intention as a behavior unit, which contains the representative semantic information of local behaviors and can be used to improve the robustness of behavior analysis. By learning the overall semantics of each behavior unit and the contextual relationships among behavior units based on a multilevel deep learning model, our approach can mitigate perturbation attacks that target local and large-scale behaviors. In addition, our approach can be applied to both low-level and high-level behavior logs (e.g., API and syscall logs). The experimental results show that our approach outperforms all the compared methods, which indicates that our approach has better performance against obfuscation attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder for Efficient and Sustainable Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06320v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, particularly water distribution systems, have increased due to rapid digitalization and the integration of IoT devices and industrial control systems (ICS). These cyber-physical systems (CPS) introduce new vulnerabilities, requiring robust and automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) to mitigate potential threats. This study addresses key challenges in anomaly detection by leveraging time correlations in sensor data, integrating physical principles into machine learning models, and optimizing computational efficiency for edge applications. We build upon the concept of temporal differential consistency (TDC) loss to capture the dynamics of the system, ensuring meaningful relationships between dynamic states. Expanding on this foundation, we propose a hybrid autoencoder-based approach, referred to as hybrid TDC-AE, which extends TDC by incorporating both deterministic nodes and conventional statistical nodes. This hybrid structure enables the model to account for non-deterministic processes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while improving time to detect anomalies by 3%, outperforming the BATADAL challenge leader without requiring domain-specific knowledge, making it broadly applicable. Additionally, it maintains the computational efficiency of conventional autoencoders while reducing the number of fully connected layers, resulting in a more sustainable and efficient solution. The method demonstrates how leveraging physics-inspired consistency principles enhances anomaly detection and strengthens the resilience of cyber-physical systems.</p></details> |  | None |

The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71.

| **[Stabilizing Information Flow Entropy: Regularization for Safe and Interpretable Autonomous Driving Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16277v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep perception networks in autonomous driving traditionally rely on data-intensive training regimes and post-hoc anomaly detection, often disregarding fundamental information-theoretic constraints governing stable information processing. We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Positional Encoding in Transformer-Based Time Series Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12370v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in transformer-based models have greatly improved time series analysis, providing robust solutions for tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification. A crucial element of these models is positional encoding, which allows transformers to capture the intrinsic sequential nature of time series data. This survey systematically examines existing techniques for positional encoding in transformer-based time series models. We investigate a variety of methods, including fixed, learnable, relative, and hybrid approaches, and evaluate their effectiveness in different time series classification tasks. Our findings indicate that data characteristics like sequence length, signal complexity, and dimensionality significantly influence method effectiveness. Advanced positional encoding methods exhibit performance gains in terms of prediction accuracy, however, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity. Furthermore, we outline key challenges and suggest potential research directions to enhance positional encoding strategies. By delivering a comprehensive overview and quantitative benchmarking, this survey intends to assist researchers and practitioners in selecting and designing effective positional encoding methods for transformer-based time series models.</p></details> |  | None |

Using a ResNet-34 on log-Mel spectrograms, we embed three watermarks: a simple trigger, an adversarially trained trigger robust to noise and filtering, and a hidden gradient/weight signature. A convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) warm-up and free-bits flags off-distribution queries.

However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.</p></details> |  | None |

We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 4th International Workshop on Spatio-Temporal Reasoning and Learning (STRL 2025) at the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> | None |
| **[Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15033v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations} found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14956v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification, and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents, and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution over time.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures | None |

Data curation is a time-consuming process for a large volume of data, making it challenging and expensive to deploy data analytics platforms in new environments. Transfer learning (TL) mechanisms promise to mitigate data sparsity and model complexity by utilizing pre-trained models for a new task. Despite the triumph of TL in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, efforts on complex ST models for anomaly detection (AD) applications are limited. In this study, we present the potential of TL within the context of high-dimensional ST AD with a hybrid autoencoder architecture, incorporating convolutional, graph, and recurrent neural networks.

First, most detection models usually consider centralized detection. Thus, all sensor data have to be uploaded to the control center for analysis, leading to a heavy traffic load. However, industrial sensor networks have high requirements for reliable and real-time communication. The heavy traffic load may cause communication delays or packets lost by corruption. Second, there are complex spatial and temporal features in industrial sensor data. The full extraction of such features plays a key role in improving detection performance.To solve the limitations above, this paper develops a cloud-edge collaborative data anomaly detection approach for industrial sensor networks that mainly consists of a sensor data detection model deployed at individual edges and a sensor data analysis model deployed in the cloud. The former is implemented using Gaussian and Bayesian algorithms, which effectively filter the substantial volume of sensor data generated during the normal operation of the industrial sensor network, thereby reducing traffic load. It only uploads all the sensor data to the sensor data analysis model for further analysis when the network is in an anomalous state. The latter based on GCRL is developed by inserting Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) into Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which can effectively extract the spatial and temporal features of the sensor data for anomaly detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally, RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step analytical outputs.

However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks. We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection.

Consequently, ensuring the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream, producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and non-anomalous cases.

To this end, we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Pattern Recognition (2025)</p></details> | None |

Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects, rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.</p></details> |  | None |

These advancements are pivotal for integrating intelligent, data-driven applications aimed at enhancing network reliability and operational autonomy through the introduction of cognitive capabilities, as exemplified by the emerging Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) standards. Despite its potential, the nascent nature of O-RAN technology presents challenges, primarily due to the absence of mature operational standards. This complicates the management of data and intelligent applications, particularly when integrating with traditional network management and operational support systems. Divergent vendor-specific design approaches further hinder migration and limit solution reusability. These challenges are compounded by a skills gap in telecommunications business-oriented engineering, which remains a key barrier to effective O-RAN deployment and intelligent application development. To address these challenges, Boldyn Networks developed a novel cloud-native data analytics platform, specifically designed to support scalable AI integration within O-RAN deployments. This platform underwent rigorous testing in real-world scenarios, and applied advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve operational efficiency and customer experience. Implementation involved adopting Development Operations (DevOps) practices, leveraging data lakehouse architectures tailored for AI applications, and employing sophisticated data engineering strategies. The platform successfully addresses connectivity challenges inherent in real-world offshore windfarm deployments using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for anomaly detection in network connectivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures.

Comprehensive and in-depth analyses of these data are critical for hypothesis validation, anomaly detection, reproducibility, and impactful findings. Although workflow provenance techniques support such analyses, at large scale, the provenance data become complex and difficult to analyze. Existing systems depend on custom scripts, structured queries, or static dashboards, limiting data interaction. In this work, we introduce an evaluation methodology, reference architecture, and open-source implementation that leverages interactive Large Language Model (LLM) agents for runtime data analysis. Our approach uses a lightweight, metadata-driven design that translates natural language into structured provenance queries. Evaluations across LLaMA, GPT, Gemini, and Claude, covering diverse query classes and a real-world chemistry workflow, show that modular design, prompt tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enable accurate and insightful LLM agent responses beyond recorded provenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in the proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC).

Recent studies have incorporated graph learning techniques to extract detailed information from provenance graphs, enabling the detection of attacks with greater granularity. Nevertheless, existing studies have largely overlooked the continuous yet subtle temporal variations in the structure of provenance graphs, which may correspond to surreptitious perturbation anomalies in ongoing APT attacks. Therefore, we introduce TFLAG, an advanced anomaly detection framework that for the first time integrates the structural dynamic extraction capabilities of temporal graph model with the anomaly delineation abilities of deviation networks to pinpoint covert attack activities in provenance graphs. This self-supervised integration framework leverages the graph model to extract neighbor interaction data under continuous temporal changes from historical benign behaviors within provenance graphs, while simultaneously utilizing deviation networks to accurately distinguish authentic attack activities from false positive deviations due to unexpected subtle perturbations. The experimental results indicate that, through a comprehensive design that utilizes both attribute and temporal information, it can accurately identify the time windows associated with APT attack behaviors without prior knowledge (e.g., labeled data samples), demonstrating superior accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods in differentiating between attack events and system false positive events.</p></details> |  | None |

In such settings, inference latency poses a critical security risk, as delays may provide exploitable opportunities for attackers. However, many state-of-the-art ML-based HIDS solutions rely on computationally intensive architectures with high inference costs, limiting their practical deployment. This paper proposes LIGHT-HIDS, a lightweight machine learning framework that combines a compressed neural network feature extractor trained via Deep Support Vector Data Description (DeepSVDD) with an efficient novelty detection model. This hybrid approach enables the learning of compact, meaningful representations of normal system call behavior for accurate anomaly detection. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that LIGHT-HIDS consistently enhances detection accuracy while reducing inference time by up to 75x compared to state-of-the-art methods. These findings highlight its effectiveness and scalability as a machine learning-based solution for real-time host intrusion detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 24th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> | None |
| **[A Domain Knowledge Informed Approach for Anomaly Detection of Electric Vehicle Interior Sounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13390v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing</p></details> | None |

The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures | None |

However, these methods face great challenges in handling high-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In this study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group center geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation module to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training data and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a Down-sampling Network (Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center point cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling Network (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by fusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for construction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a more precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an Object-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and 84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 Accepted, 9 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |

Normal fine-grained tissue variability such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12787v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2) the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation, connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods.</p></details> | 10 pages,8 figures | None |

A cross-modal deep metric learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify different time series features. The inner product of principal component direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection speed, and strong robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Emerging vision foundation models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations. In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and significant class imbalance. Our results highlight the efficacy of utilizing pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging.

These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes, while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns, while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a single unified network.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Attackers can create adversarial samples that alter the sequence characteristics of behavior sequences to deceive malware classifiers. The existing methods for generating adversarial samples typically involve deleting or replacing crucial behaviors in the original data sequences, or inserting benign behaviors that may violate the behavior constraints. However, these methods that directly manipulate sequences make adversarial samples difficult to implement or apply in practice. In this paper, we propose an adversarial attack approach based on Deep Q-Network and a heuristic backtracking search strategy, which can generate perturbation sequences that satisfy practical conditions for successful attacks. Subsequently, we utilize a novel transformation approach that maps modifications back to the source code, thereby avoiding the need to directly modify the behavior log sequences. We conduct an evaluation of our approach, and the results confirm its effectiveness in generating adversarial samples from real-world malware behavior sequences, which have a high success rate in evading anomaly detection models. Furthermore, our approach is practical and can generate adversarial samples while maintaining the functionality of the modified software.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems Based on Cross-Domain Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11786v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used in industry, and their security and stability are very important. Once the ICS is attacked, it may cause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in ICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication networks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing the security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of different domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs are correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by analyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach based on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can learn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within different domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent the behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint features of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave differently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to identify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training. The experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better than existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it also presents major cybersecurity issues such as cyberattacks affecting industrial processes. Federated Learning (FL) combined with time-series analysis is a promising cyberattack detection mechanism proposed in the literature. However, the fact of having a single point of failure and network bottleneck are critical challenges that need to be tackled. Thus, this article explores the benefits of the Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in terms of cyberattack detection and resource consumption. The work presents TemporalFED, a software module for detecting anomalies in industrial environments using FL paradigms and time series. TemporalFED incorporates three components: Time Series Conversion, Feature Engineering, and Time Series Stationary Conversion. To evaluate TemporalFED, it was deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL framework. Then, a pool of experiments measured the detection performance and resource consumption in a chemical gas industrial environment with different time-series configurations, FL paradigms, and topologies. The results showcase the superiority of the configuration utilizing DFL and Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) paradigms, along with a fully connected topology, which achieved the best performance in anomaly detection. Regarding resource consumption, the configuration without feature engineering employed less bandwidth, CPU, and RAM than other configurations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data. Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues.

However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2025</p></details> | None |

| **[Action Hints: Semantic Typicality and Context Uniqueness for Generalizable Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11058v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments. Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance [7]. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |

Although their software relies on strict verification and validation processes following well-established best-practices and certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to residual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at design-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores run-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the resilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European Train Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual control flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time monitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly localization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link relevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a reference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its capability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 6th International Conference on Reliability, Safety, and Security of Railway Systems (RSSRail2025)</p></details> | None |

Exploiting the intrinsic geometry of optimal transport, we construct a multiscale transform applicable to both absolutely continuous and discrete measures. Central to our approach is a refinement operator based on McCann's interpolants, which preserves the geodesic structure of measure flows and serves as an upsampling mechanism. Building on this, we introduce the optimality number, a scalar that quantifies deviations of a sequence from Wasserstein geodesicity across scales, enabling the detection of irregular dynamics and anomalies. We establish key theoretical guarantees, including stability of the transform and geometric decay of coefficients, ensuring robustness and interpretability of the multiscale representation. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our methodology through numerical experiments: denoising and anomaly detection in Gaussian flows, analysis of point cloud dynamics under vector fields, and the multiscale characterization of neural network learning trajectories.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images, and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D anomaly detection.</p></details> | Page 14, 5 pictures | None |

| **[Electric Vehicle Identification from Behind Smart Meter Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19316v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.</p></details> | 27 pages, | None |

With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust, privacy-preserving EVCS security.</p></details> |  | None |

Current approaches require lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass, and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis: vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we first demonstrate analytically that double descent does not occur in linear unsupervised autoencoders (AEs). In contrast, we show for the first time that both double and triple descent can be observed with nonlinear AEs across various data models and architectural designs. We examine the effects of partial sample and feature noise and highlight the importance of bottleneck size in influencing the double descent curve. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we uncover model-wise, epoch-wise, and sample-wise double descent across several data types and architectures. Our findings indicate that over-parameterized models not only improve reconstruction but also enhance performance in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and domain adaptation, highlighting their practical value in complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series data.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, unsupervised anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous from normal instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WSDM 2026. 11 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 1 algorithm, 8 datasets, contextual anomaly detection framework for tabular data</p></details> | None |

| **[Agents of Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08535v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  | None |

Recognizing this limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy.

Associative Knowledge Graphs (AKGs) offer a promising approach by leveraging sparse graph structures to encode sequences. The objective was to develop a method for sequence storage and retrieval using AKGs that maintain high memory capacity and context-based retrieval accuracy while introducing algorithms for efficient element ordering. The study utilized Sequential Structural Associative Knowledge Graphs (SSAKGs). These graphs encode sequences as transitive tournaments with nodes representing objects and edges defining the order. Four ordering algorithms were developed and tested: Simple Sort, Node Ordering, Enhanced Node Ordering, and Weighted Edges Node Ordering. The evaluation was conducted on synthetic datasets consisting of random sequences of varying lengths and distributions, and real-world datasets, including sentence-based sequences from the NLTK library and miRNA sequences mapped symbolically with a window-based approach. Metrics such as precision, sensitivity, and specificity were employed to assess performance. SSAKGs exhibited quadratic growth in memory capacity relative to graph size. This study introduces a novel structural approach for sequence storage and retrieval. Key advantages include no training requirements, flexible context-based reconstruction, and high efficiency in sparse memory graphs. With broad applications in computational neuroscience and bioinformatics, the approach offers scalable solutions for sequence-based memory tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Beyond Rebalancing: Benchmarking Binary Classifiers Under Class Imbalance Without Rebalancing Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07605v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification, particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance. The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.</p></details> |  | None |

As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2nd edition of the Workshop in AI and Finance at ECAI-2025</p></details> | None |

The algorithm infers equivalence classes of entities with similar behavior observed from the events, and then builds regular expressions that capture the values of those entities. As opposed to deep-learning approaches, the regular expressions are directly interpretable, which also translates to interpretable anomalies. We evaluate HyGLAD against all 7 unsupervised anomaly detection methods from DeepOD on five datasets from real-world systems. The experimental results show that on average HyGLAD outperforms existing deep-learning methods while being an order of magnitude more efficient in training and inference (single CPU vs GPU).

However, most GAD methods assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications. To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire future research in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICKG 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Impact of Labeling Inaccuracy and Image Noise on Tooth Segmentation in Panoramic Radiographs using Federated, Centralized and Local Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06553v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints, heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI. We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation (additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set. From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at 0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777). Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD: 1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD: 1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI deployment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contrastive Self-Supervised Network Intrusion Detection using Augmented Negative Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06550v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity. While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing self-supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR), 2025.

| **[CAPMix: Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection Based on Abnormal Assumptions with Dual-Space Mixup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06419v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task, particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated training data.

Traditional log analysis methods for anomaly detection and root cause analysis rely heavily on expert knowledge or fully supervised learning models, both of which require extensive labeled data and significant human effort. To address these challenges, we propose ALPHA, the first Active Learning Pipeline for Human-free log Analysis. ALPHA integrates semantic embedding, clustering-based representative sampling, and large language model (LLM)-assisted few-shot annotation to automate the anomaly detection process. The LLM annotated labels are propagated across clusters, enabling large-scale training of an anomaly detector with minimal supervision. To enhance the annotation accuracy, we propose a two-step few-shot refinement strategy that adaptively selects informative prompts based on the LLM's observed error patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world log datasets demonstrate that ALPHA achieves detection accuracy comparable to fully supervised methods while mitigating human efforts in the loop. ALPHA also supports interpretable analysis through LLM-driven root cause explanations in the post-detection stage. These capabilities make ALPHA a scalable and cost-efficient solution for truly automated log-based anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 44th IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[DACAD: Domain Adaptation Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11269v4)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |

Flow-based generative models provide a powerful framework for capturing complex probability distributions, offering exact likelihood estimation, efficient sampling, and deterministic transformations between distributions. These models leverage invertible mappings governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), enabling precise density estimation and likelihood evaluation. This tutorial presents an intuitive mathematical framework for flow-based generative models, formulating them as neural network-based representations of continuous probability densities. We explore key theoretical principles, including the Wasserstein metric, gradient flows, and density evolution governed by ODEs, to establish convergence guarantees and bridge empirical advancements with theoretical insights.

| **[Dual-Mode Deep Anomaly Detection for Medical Manufacturing: Structural Similarity and Feature Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05796v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score (4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection, yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy, efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC) classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest (PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods, affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Reliability Engineering & System Safety journal</p></details> | None |

While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Using Causality for Enhanced Prediction of Web Traffic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00612v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting web service traffic has significant social value, as it can be applied to various practical scenarios, including but not limited to dynamic resource scaling, load balancing, system anomaly detection, service-level agreement compliance, and fraud detection. Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality, more experiments</p></details> | None |

Although defective samples can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1\% on MVTec AD).</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional supervised learning methods typically require large amounts of labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines AutoEncoders for anomaly detection with active learning to iteratively enhance APT detection. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, our method reduces labeling costs while improving detection accuracy, enabling the model to effectively learn with minimal data and reduce reliance on extensive manual labeling. We present a comprehensive formulation of the Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and demonstrate how the active learning loop progressively enhances the model's performance. The framework is evaluated on real-world, imbalanced provenance trace data from the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks account for just 0.004\% of the data. The datasets, which cover multiple operating systems including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, are tested in two attack scenarios. The results show substantial improvements in detection rates during active learning, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In New Zealand, housing quality has historically been poor, with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating contributing to widespread energy hardship. Recent reforms, including the Warmer Kiwi Homes program, Healthy Homes Standards, and H1 Building Code upgrades, have delivered health and comfort improvements, yet challenges persist. Many retrofits remain partial, data on household performance are limited, and decision-making support for homeowners is fragmented. This study presents the design and evaluation of an AI-powered decision-support tool for residential energy efficiency in New Zealand. The prototype, developed using Python and Streamlit, integrates data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades) into a modular dashboard. Fifteen domain experts, including building scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners, tested the tool through semi-structured interviews. Results show strong usability (M = 4.3), high value of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive perceptions of its potential to complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool demonstrates how AI can translate national policies into personalized, household-level guidance, bridging the gap between funding, standards, and practical decision-making. Its significance lies in offering a replicable framework for reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate goals. Future development should focus on carbon metrics, tariff modeling, integration with national datasets, and longitudinal trials to assess real-world adoption.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs, posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> | None |

Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows. This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface. KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this issue, we propose a homomorphic encryption scheme for dynamic controllers that automatically discloses the residue signal for anomaly detection, while keeping all other signals private. To this end, we characterize the zero-dynamics of an encrypted dynamic system over a finite field of integers and incorporate it into a Learning With Errors (LWE) based scheme. We then present a method to further utilize the disclosed residue signal for implementing dynamic controllers over encrypted data, which does not involve re-encryption even when they have non-integer state matrices.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Extended Histogram-based Outlier Score (EHBOS)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05719v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histogram-Based Outlier Score (HBOS) is a widely used outlier or anomaly detection method known for its computational efficiency and simplicity. However, its assumption of feature independence limits its ability to detect anomalies in datasets where interactions between features are critical. In this paper, we propose the Extended Histogram-Based Outlier Score (EHBOS), which enhances HBOS by incorporating two-dimensional histograms to capture dependencies between feature pairs. This extension allows EHBOS to identify contextual and dependency-driven anomalies that HBOS fails to detect. We evaluate EHBOS on 17 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across diverse anomaly detection scenarios. EHBOS outperforms HBOS on several datasets, particularly those where feature interactions are critical in defining the anomaly structure, achieving notable improvements in ROC AUC. These results highlight that EHBOS can be a valuable extension to HBOS, with the ability to model complex feature dependencies. EHBOS offers a powerful new tool for anomaly detection, particularly in datasets where contextual or relational anomalies play a significant role.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Machine Learning-Driven Anomaly Detection for 5G O-RAN Performance Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03290v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN) elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures. We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints. This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.</p></details> | Submitted to TPAMI | None |
| **[HyPV-LEAD: Proactive Early-Warning of Cryptocurrency Anomalies through Data-Driven Structural-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03260v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance, temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks. Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits, with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain environments.</p></details> |  | None |

The widespread use of open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences. In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack: a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large, representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SPIE: Sensors + Imaging, Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications II</p></details> | None |

In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Highlight | None |
| **[Explaining Anomalies with Tensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03911v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks, a class of variational quantum many-body wave functions have attracted considerable research interest across many disciplines, including classical machine learning. Recently, Aizpurua et al. demonstrated explainable anomaly detection with matrix product states on a discrete-valued cyber-security task, using quantum-inspired methods to gain insight into the learned model and detected anomalies. Here, we extend this framework to real-valued data domains. We furthermore introduce tree tensor networks for the task of explainable anomaly detection. We demonstrate these methods with three benchmark problems, show adequate predictive performance compared to several baseline models and both tensor network architectures' ability to explain anomalous samples. We thereby extend the application of tensor networks to a broader class of potential problems and open a pathway for future extensions to more complex tensor network architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for publication at IEEE QAI 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning local and global prototypes with optimal transport for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12927v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on industrial images.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LogGuardQ: A Cognitive-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Framework for Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection in Security Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10511v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision-making, but traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents LogGuardQ (Adaptive Log Guard with Cognitive enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition and adaptive exploration strategies driven by temperature decay and curiosity. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,000,000 simulated access logs with 47.9% anomalies over 20,000 episodes, LogGuardQ achieves a 96.0% detection rate (versus 93.0% for DQN and 47.1% for PPO), with precision of 0.4776, recall of 0.9996, and an F1-score of 0.6450. The mean reward is 20.34 \pm 44.63 across all episodes (versus 18.80 \pm 43.98 for DQN and -0.17 \pm 23.79 for PPO), with an average of 5.0 steps per episode (constant across models). Graphical analyses, including learning curves smoothed with a Savgol filter (window=501, polynomial=2), variance trends, action distributions, and cumulative detections, demonstrate LogGuardQ's superior stability and efficiency. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U) confirm significant performance advantages (e.g., p = 0.0002 vs. DQN with negligible effect size, p < 0.0001 vs. PPO with medium effect size, and p < 0.0001 for DQN vs. PPO with small effect size). By bridging cognitive science and RL, LogGuardQ offers a scalable approach to adaptive learning in uncertain environments, with potential applications in cybersecurity, intrusion detection, and decision-making under uncertainty.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[Explainable Machine Learning-Based Security and Privacy Protection Framework for Internet of Medical Things Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09752v3)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet of Medical Things transcends traditional medical boundaries, enabling a transition from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. This innovative method revolutionizes healthcare by facilitating early disease detection and tailored care, particularly in chronic disease management, where IoMT automates treatments based on real-time health data collection. Nonetheless, its benefits are countered by significant security challenges that endanger the lives of its users due to the sensitivity and value of the processed data, thereby attracting malicious interests. Moreover, the utilization of wireless communication for data transmission exposes medical data to interception and tampering by cybercriminals. Additionally, anomalies may arise due to human error, network interference, or hardware malfunctions. In this context, anomaly detection based on Machine Learning (ML) is an interesting solution, but it comes up against obstacles in terms of explicability and privacy protection. To address these challenges, a new framework for Intrusion Detection Systems is introduced, leveraging Artificial Neural Networks for intrusion detection while utilizing Federated Learning for privacy preservation. Additionally, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods are incorporated to enhance model explanation and interpretation. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated and compared with centralized approaches using multiple datasets containing network and medical data, simulating various attack types impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical and physiological data. The results offer compelling evidence that the FL method performs comparably to the centralized method, demonstrating high performance. Additionally, it affords the dual advantage of safeguarding privacy and providing model explanation while adhering to ethical principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables, journal paper</p></details> | None |
| **[SALAD -- Semantics-Aware Logical Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02101v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies, such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

A core limitation is the absence of a principled mechanism to detect and adapt to the unexpectedness. While traditional surprise measures--such as Shannon or Bayesian Surprise--offer momentary detection of deviation, they fail to capture whether a system is truly learning and adapting. In this work, we introduce Mutual Information Surprise (MIS), a new framework that redefines surprise not as anomaly detection, but as a signal of epistemic growth. MIS quantifies the impact of new observations on mutual information, enabling autonomous systems to reflect on their learning progression. We develop a statistical test sequence to detect meaningful shifts in estimated mutual information and propose a mutual information surprise reaction policy (MISRP) that dynamically governs system behavior through sampling adjustment and process forking. Empirical evaluations--on both synthetic domains and a dynamic pollution map estimation task--show that MISRP-governed strategies significantly outperform classical surprise-based approaches in stability, responsiveness, and predictive accuracy. By shifting surprise from reactive to reflective, MIS offers a path toward more self-aware and adaptive autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-S...</summary><p>Pre-Submission Version</p></details> | None |
| **[When LLM Meets Time Series: Can LLMs Perform Multi-Step Time Series Reasoning and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01822v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work, we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33 real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at https://github.com/USC-Melady/TSAIA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/USC-Melady/TSAIA) |

| **[Robust Anomaly Detection through Multi-Modal Autoencoder Fusion for Small Vehicle Damage Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01719v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage, such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast, state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, submitted to Elsevier MLWA</p></details> | None |
| **[Unsupervised Identification and Replay-based Detection (UIRD) for New Category Anomaly Detection in ECG Signal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01512v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals, the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore, to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.</p></details> |  | None |

This scenario highlights the need for solutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic and changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for network flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning capabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal behavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data, which is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is constantly changing and labeled data is scarce. The model was implemented using the River library with a One-Class SVM and evaluated on the NF-UNSW-NB15 dataset and its extended version v2, which contain network flows labeled with different attack categories. The results show an accuracy above 98%, a false positive rate below 3.1%, and a recall of 100% in the most advanced version of the dataset. In addition, the low processing time per flow (<0.033 ms) demonstrates the feasibility of the approach for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> | None |
