| **[BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15610v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures | None |
| **[An Advanced Framework for Ultra-Realistic Simulation and Digital Twinning for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01328v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation is a fundamental tool in developing autonomous vehicles, enabling rigorous testing without the logistical and safety challenges associated with real-world trials. As autonomous vehicle technologies evolve and public safety demands increase, advanced, realistic simulation frameworks are critical. Current testing paradigms employ a mix of general-purpose and specialized simulators, such as CARLA and IVRESS, to achieve high-fidelity results. However, these tools often struggle with compatibility due to differing platform, hardware, and software requirements, severely hampering their combined effectiveness. This paper introduces BlueICE, an advanced framework for ultra-realistic simulation and digital twinning, to address these challenges. BlueICE's innovative architecture allows for the decoupling of computing platforms, hardware, and software dependencies while offering researchers customizable testing environments to meet diverse fidelity needs. Key features include containerization to ensure compatibility across different systems, a unified communication bridge for seamless integration of various simulation tools, and synchronized orchestration of input and output across simulators. This framework facilitates the development of sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and sets a new standard in simulation accuracy and flexibility. The paper further explores the application of BlueICE in two distinct case studies: the ICAT indoor testbed and the STAR campus outdoor testbed at the University of Delaware. These case studies demonstrate BlueICE's capability to create sophisticated digital twins for autonomous vehicle testing and underline its potential as a standardized testbed for future autonomous driving technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages. 5 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> | None |
| **[A Survey on Semantic Communications in Internet of Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03767v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as the core of intelligent transportation system, enables comprehensive interconnection between vehicles and their surroundings through multiple communication modes, which is significant for autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management. However, with the emergence of new applications, traditional communication technologies face the problems of scarce spectrum resources and high latency. Semantic communication, which focuses on extracting, transmitting, and recovering some useful semantic information from messages, can reduce redundant data transmission, improve spectrum utilization, and provide innovative solutions to communication challenges in the IoV. This paper systematically reviews state of art of semantic communications in the IoV, elaborates the technical background of IoV and semantic communications, and deeply discusses key technologies of semantic communications in IoV, including semantic information extraction, semantic communication architecture, resource allocation and management, and so on. Through specific case studies, it demonstrates that semantic communications can be effectively employed in the scenarios of traffic environment perception and understanding, intelligent driving decision support, IoV service optimization, and intelligent traffic management. Additionally, it analyzes the current challenges and future research directions. This survey reveals that semantic communications has broad application prospects in IoV, but it is necessary to solve the real existing problems by combining advanced technologies to promote its wide application in IoV and contributing to the development of intelligent transportation system.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to Entropy</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces an enhanced End-to-End model named MapFM for online vectorized HD map generation. We show significantly boost feature representation quality by incorporating powerful foundation model for encoding camera images. To further enrich the model's understanding of the environment and improve prediction quality, we integrate auxiliary prediction heads for semantic segmentation in the BEV representation. This multi-task learning approach provides richer contextual supervision, leading to a more comprehensive scene representation and ultimately resulting in higher accuracy and improved quality of the predicted vectorized HD maps.

| **[An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15045v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving. Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[NetRoller: Interfacing General and Specialized Models for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14589v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating General Models (GMs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with Specialized Models (SMs) in autonomous driving tasks presents a promising approach to mitigating challenges in data diversity and model capacity of existing specialized driving models. However, this integration leads to problems of asynchronous systems, which arise from the distinct characteristics inherent in GMs and SMs. To tackle this challenge, we propose NetRoller, an adapter that incorporates a set of novel mechanisms to facilitate the seamless integration of GMs and specialized driving models. Specifically, our mechanisms for interfacing the asynchronous GMs and SMs are organized into three key stages. NetRoller first harvests semantically rich and computationally efficient representations from the reasoning processes of LLMs using an early stopping mechanism, which preserves critical insights on driving context while maintaining low overhead. It then applies learnable query embeddings, nonsensical embeddings, and positional layer embeddings to facilitate robust and efficient cross-modality translation. At last, it employs computationally efficient Query Shift and Feature Shift mechanisms to enhance the performance of SMs through few-epoch fine-tuning. Based on the mechanisms formalized in these three stages, NetRoller enables specialized driving models to operate at their native frequencies while maintaining situational awareness of the GM. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating GM through NetRoller significantly improves human similarity and safety in planning tasks, and it also achieves noticeable precision improvements in detection and mapping tasks for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Rex-sys-hk/NetRoller .</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Rex-sys-hk/NetRoller) |
| **[Toward Safety-First Human-Like Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles in Time-Varying Traffic Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14502v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent advancements in artificial intelligence technologies have shown great potential in improving transport efficiency and safety, autonomous vehicles(AVs) still face great challenge of driving in time-varying traffic flow, especially in dense and interactive situations. Meanwhile, human have free wills and usually do not make the same decisions even situate in the exactly same scenarios, leading to the data-driven methods suffer from poor migratability and high search cost problems, decreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the behavior policy. In this research, we propose a safety-first human-like decision-making framework(SF-HLDM) for AVs to drive safely, comfortably, and social compatiblely in effiency. The framework integrates a hierarchical progressive framework, which combines a spatial-temporal attention (S-TA) mechanism for other road users' intention inference, a social compliance estimation module for behavior regulation, and a Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning(DERL) model for expanding the search space efficiently and effectively to make avoidance of falling into the local optimal trap and reduce the risk of overfitting, thus make human-like decisions with interpretability and flexibility. The SF-HLDM framework enables autonomous driving AI agents dynamically adjusts decision parameters to maintain safety margins and adhering to contextually appropriate driving behaviors at the same time.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ADRD: LLM-Driven Autonomous Driving Based on Rule-based Decision Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14299v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to construct an interpretable autonomous driving decision-making system has become a focal point in academic research. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate executable, rule-based decision systems to address this challenge. Specifically, harnessing the strong reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs, we introduce the ADRD(LLM-Driven Autonomous Driving Based on Rule-based Decision Systems) framework, which integrates three core modules: the Information Module, the Agents Module, and the Testing Module. The framework operates by first aggregating contextual driving scenario information through the Information Module, then utilizing the Agents Module to generate rule-based driving tactics. These tactics are iteratively refined through continuous interaction with the Testing Module. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that ADRD exhibits superior performance in autonomous driving decision tasks. Compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches and the most advanced LLM-based methods, ADRD shows significant advantages in terms of interpretability, response speed, and driving performance. These results highlight the framework's ability to achieve comprehensive and accurate understanding of complex driving scenarios, and underscore the promising future of transparent, rule-based decision systems that are easily modifiable and broadly applicable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates large language models with rule-based systems for autonomous driving decision-making, and our findings validate its potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics. With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets. This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex. This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking. Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes. To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling. The pipeline operates in three novel stages. Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels. These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders. The Manual Revision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine and validate the annotations. Extensive user studies and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our labeling pipeline. Meanwhile, experiments confirm that Leader360V significantly enhances model performance for 360 video segmentation and tracking, paving the way for more scalable 360 scene understanding.</p></details> | 23 pages, 16 figures | None |
| **[Cross-Modal Geometric Hierarchy Fusion: An Implicit-Submap Driven Framework for Resilient 3D Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14243v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based place recognition serves as a crucial enabler for long-term autonomy in robotics and autonomous driving systems. Yet, prevailing methodologies relying on handcrafted feature extraction face dual challenges: (1) Inconsistent point cloud density, induced by ego-motion dynamics and environmental disturbances during repeated traversals, leads to descriptor instability, and (2) Representation fragility stems from reliance on single-level geometric abstractions that lack discriminative power in structurally complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that redefines 3D place recognition through density-agnostic geometric reasoning. Specifically, we introduce an implicit 3D representation based on elastic points, which is immune to the interference of original scene point cloud density and achieves the characteristic of uniform distribution. Subsequently, we derive the occupancy grid and normal vector information of the scene from this implicit representation. Finally, with the aid of these two types of information, we obtain descriptors that fuse geometric information from both bird's-eye view (capturing macro-level spatial layouts) and 3D segment (encoding micro-scale surface geometries) perspectives. We conducted extensive experiments on numerous datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) across diverse environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization for historical maps, showcasing excellent Resilient and scalability. Our code will be open-sourced in the future.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WHALES: A Multi-agent Scheduling Dataset for Enhanced Cooperation in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13340v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative perception research is constrained by the scarcity of datasets that capture the complexity of real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) interactions, particularly under dynamic communication constraints. To address this, we present WHALES (Wireless enhanced Autonomous vehicles with Large number of Engaged agents), the first large-scale V2X dataset specifically designed to benchmark communication-aware agent scheduling and scalable cooperative perception. WHALES establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) standard with an average of 8.4 cooperative agents per scene and 2.01 million annotated 3D objects spanning diverse traffic scenarios. It integrates communication metadata to simulate real-world communication bottlenecks, enabling rigorous evaluation of scheduling strategies. To further advance the field, we propose the Coverage-Aware Historical Scheduler (CAHS), a novel scheduling baseline that prioritizes agents based on historical viewpoint coverage, improving perception performance over existing SOTA methods. WHALES bridges the gap between simulated and real-world V2X challenges, offering a robust framework to explore perception-scheduling co-design, cross-data generalization, and scalability limits.

| **[KDMOS:Knowledge Distillation for Motion Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14130v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion Object Segmentation (MOS) is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enhances localization, path planning, map construction, scene flow estimation, and future state prediction. While existing methods achieve strong performance, balancing accuracy and real-time inference remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a logits-based knowledge distillation framework for MOS, aiming to improve accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency. Specifically, we adopt a Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection-based model as the student and a non-projection model as the teacher. To handle the severe imbalance between moving and non-moving classes, we decouple them and apply tailored distillation strategies, allowing the teacher model to better learn key motion-related features. This approach significantly reduces false positives and false negatives. Additionally, we introduce dynamic upsampling, optimize the network architecture, and achieve a 7.69% reduction in parameter count, mitigating overfitting. Our method achieves a notable IoU of 78.8% on the hidden test set of the SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset and delivers competitive results on the Apollo dataset.

| **[A Hierarchical Test Platform for Vision Language Model (VLM)-Integrated Real-World Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14100v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated notable promise in autonomous driving by offering the potential for multimodal reasoning through pretraining on extensive image-text pairs. However, adapting these models from broad web-scale data to the safety-critical context of driving presents a significant challenge, commonly referred to as domain shift. Existing simulation-based and dataset-driven evaluation methods, although valuable, often fail to capture the full complexity of real-world scenarios and cannot easily accommodate repeatable closed-loop testing with flexible scenario manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical real-world test platform specifically designed to evaluate VLM-integrated autonomous driving systems. Our approach includes a modular, low-latency on-vehicle middleware that allows seamless incorporation of various VLMs, a clearly separated perception-planning-control architecture that can accommodate both VLM-based and conventional modules, and a configurable suite of real-world testing scenarios on a closed track that facilitates controlled yet authentic evaluations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed platform`s testing and evaluation ability with a case study involving a VLM-enabled autonomous vehicle, highlighting how our test framework supports robust experimentation under diverse conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

For intelligent transportation systems (ITS), where accurate scene understanding is critical for safety and efficiency, this new paradigm offers unprecedented capabilities. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of LLM-augmented image segmentation, focusing on its applications, challenges, and future directions within ITS. We provide a taxonomy of current approaches based on their prompting mechanisms and core architectures, and we highlight how these innovations can enhance road scene understanding for autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and infrastructure maintenance. Finally, we identify key challenges, including real-time performance and safety-critical reliability, and outline a perspective centered on explainable, human-centric AI as a prerequisite for the successful deployment of this technology in next-generation transportation systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FindMeIfYouCan: Bringing Open Set metrics to $\textit{near} $, $ \textit{far} $ and $\textit{farther}$ Out-of-Distribution Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14008v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art Object Detection (OD) methods predominantly operate under a closed-world assumption, where test-time categories match those encountered during training. However, detecting and localizing unknown objects is crucial for safety-critical applications in domains such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. Recently, Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a vital research direction for OD, focusing on identifying incorrect predictions typically associated with unknown objects. This paper shows that the current evaluation protocol for OOD-OD violates the assumption of non-overlapping objects with respect to the In-Distribution (ID) datasets, and obscures crucial situations such as ignoring unknown objects, potentially leading to overconfidence in deployment scenarios where truly novel objects might be encountered. To address these limitations, we manually curate, and enrich the existing benchmark by exploiting semantic similarity to create new evaluation splits categorized as $\textit{near}$, $\textit{far}$, and $\textit{farther}$ from ID distributions. Additionally, we incorporate established metrics from the Open Set community, providing deeper insights into how effectively methods detect unknowns, when they ignore them, and when they mistakenly classify OOD objects as ID. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that semantically and visually close OOD objects are easier to localize than far ones, but are also more easily confounded with ID objects. $\textit{Far}$ and $\textit{farther}$ objects are harder to localize but less prone to be taken for an ID object.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

It examines the theoretical underpinnings, essential methodological frameworks, and recent technological advancements in leveraging acoustic signals for high-fidelity environmental perception, causal physical reasoning, and predictive simulation of dynamic events. The survey explains how acoustic signals, as direct carriers of mechanical wave energy from physical events, encode rich, latent information about material properties, internal geometric structures, and complex interaction dynamics. Specifically, this survey establishes the theoretical foundation by explaining how fundamental physical laws govern the encoding of physical information within acoustic signals. It then reviews the core methodological pillars, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), generative models, and self-supervised multimodal learning frameworks. Furthermore, the survey details the significant applications of acoustic world models in robotics, autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance. Finally, it systematically outlines the important technical and ethical challenges while proposing a concrete roadmap for future research directions toward robust, causal, uncertainty-aware, and responsible acoustic intelligence. These elements collectively point to a research pathway towards embodied active acoustic intelligence, empowering AI systems to construct an internal "intuitive physics" engine through sound.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages,11 equations</p></details> | None |

However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website link:https://autovla.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, the generation of large-scale 3D scenes that require spatial coherence remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose X-Scene, a novel framework for large-scale driving scene generation that achieves both geometric intricacy and appearance fidelity, while offering flexible controllability. Specifically, X-Scene supports multi-granular control, including low-level conditions such as user-provided or text-driven layout for detailed scene composition and high-level semantic guidance such as user-intent and LLM-enriched text prompts for efficient customization. To enhance geometrical and visual fidelity, we introduce a unified pipeline that sequentially generates 3D semantic occupancy and the corresponding multiview images, while ensuring alignment between modalities. Additionally, we extend the generated local region into a large-scale scene through consistency-aware scene outpainting, which extrapolates new occupancy and images conditioned on the previously generated area, enhancing spatial continuity and preserving visual coherence. The resulting scenes are lifted into high-quality 3DGS representations, supporting diverse applications such as scene exploration. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that X-Scene significantly advances controllability and fidelity for large-scale driving scene generation, empowering data generation and simulation for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, Project page at https://x-scene.github.io/</p></details> | None |

Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Existing methods struggle to disentangle ego-vehicle motion (perspective shifts) from scene evolvement (agent interactions), leading to suboptimal predictions. Instead, we propose to separate environmental changes from ego-motion by leveraging the scene-centric coordinate systems. In this paper, we introduce COME: a framework that integrates scene-centric forecasting Control into the Occupancy world ModEl. Specifically, COME first generates ego-irrelevant, spatially consistent future features through a scene-centric prediction branch, which are then converted into scene condition using a tailored ControlNet. These condition features are subsequently injected into the occupancy world model, enabling more accurate and controllable future occupancy predictions. Experimental results on the nuScenes-Occ3D dataset show that COME achieves consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across diverse configurations, including different input sources (ground-truth, camera-based, fusion-based occupancy) and prediction horizons (3s and 8s). For example, under the same settings, COME achieves 26.3% better mIoU metric than DOME and 23.7% better mIoU metric than UniScene. These results highlight the efficacy of disentangled representation learning in enhancing spatio-temporal prediction fidelity for world models.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel merging control scheme based on reinforcement learning, which integrates lateral control mechanisms. This approach ensures the smooth integration of vehicles from the merging lane onto the main road, optimizing both fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Furthermore, we recognize the impact of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication on control strategies and introduce an enhanced protocol leveraging Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4. This protocol aims to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) and improve communication reliability. In our simulations, we employ two AoI-based metrics to rigorously assess the protocol's effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. By combining the NS3 network simulator with Python, we simulate V2V communication and vehicle control simultaneously.

Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[Bridging Data-Driven and Physics-Based Models: A Consensus Multi-Model Kalman Filter for Robust Vehicle State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12862v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle state estimation presents a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving systems, requiring both physical interpretability and the ability to capture complex nonlinear behaviors across diverse operating conditions. Traditional methodologies often rely exclusively on either physics-based or data-driven models, each with complementary strengths and limitations that become most noticeable during critical scenarios. This paper presents a novel consensus multi-model Kalman filter framework that integrates heterogeneous model types to leverage their complementary strengths while minimizing individual weaknesses. We introduce two distinct methodologies for handling covariance propagation in data-driven models: a Koopman operator-based linearization approach enabling analytical covariance propagation, and an ensemble-based method providing unified uncertainty quantification across model types without requiring pretraining. Our approach implements an iterative consensus fusion procedure that dynamically weighs different models based on their demonstrated reliability in current operating conditions. The experimental results conducted on an electric all-wheel-drive Equinox vehicle demonstrate performance improvements over single-model techniques, with particularly significant advantages during challenging maneuvers and varying road conditions, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the gap between simulation and the real environment remains a major obstacle to the practical deployment of RL. Agents trained in simulators often struggle to maintain performance when transferred to real-world physical environments. In this paper, we propose a latent space based approach to analyze the impact of simulation on real-world policy improvement in model-based settings. As a natural extension of model-based methods, our approach enables an intuitive observation of the challenges faced by model-based methods in sim-to-real transfer. Experiments conducted in the MuJoCo environment evaluate the performance of our method in both measuring and mitigating the sim-to-real gap. The experiments also highlight the various challenges that remain in overcoming the sim-to-real gap, especially for model-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it is tedious and time-consuming to construct traffic scenarios for ADS testing. In this paper, we propose TrafficComposer, a multi-modal traffic scenario construction approach for ADS testing. TrafficComposer takes as input a natural language (NL) description of a desired traffic scenario and a complementary traffic scene image. Then, it generates the corresponding traffic scenario in a simulator, such as CARLA and LGSVL. Specifically, TrafficComposer integrates high-level dynamic information about the traffic scenario from the NL description and intricate details about the surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, and the road network from the image. The information from the two modalities is complementary to each other and helps generate high-quality traffic scenarios for ADS testing. On a benchmark of 120 traffic scenarios, TrafficComposer achieves 97.0% accuracy, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 7.3%. Both direct testing and fuzz testing experiments on six ADSs prove the bug detection capabilities of the traffic scenarios generated by TrafficComposer. These scenarios can directly discover 37 bugs and help two fuzzing methods find 33%--124% more bugs serving as initial seeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to FSE 2025</p></details> | None |

The proposed framework is designed to 1. maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration), and 2. enhance the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while minimizing handoffs (HOs). We cast this problem as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and develop solutions for both predefined and unknown preferences of the conflicting objectives. Specifically, we develop a novel envelope MORL solution which develops policies that address multiple objectives with unknown preferences to the agent. While this approach reduces reliance on scalar rewards, policy effectiveness varying with different preferences is a challenge. To address this, we apply a generalized version of the Bellman equation and optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q values to learn a unified parametric representation capable of generating optimal policies across all possible preference configurations. Following an initial learning phase, our agent can execute optimal policies under any specified preference or infer preferences from minimal data samples. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the envelope-based MORL solution and demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle motion dynamics, HOs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> | None |

With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, autonomous driving, and large-scale models in the traffic domain, lane-level traffic prediction has emerged as an indispensable direction. However, further progress in this field is hindered by the absence of comprehensive and unified evaluation standards, coupled with limited public availability of data and code. In this paper, we present the first systematic classification framework for lane-level traffic prediction, offering a structured taxonomy and analysis of existing methods. We construct three representative datasets from two real-world road networks, covering both regular and irregular lane configurations, and make them publicly available to support future research. We further establishes a unified spatial topology structure and prediction task formulation, and proposes a simple yet effective baseline model, GraphMLP, based on graph structure and MLP networks. This unified framework enables consistent evaluation across datasets and modeling paradigms. We also reproduce previously unavailable code from existing studies and conduct extensive experiments to assess a range of models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and applicability, providing the first benchmark that jointly considers predictive performance and training cost for lane-level traffic scenarios.

We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld</p></details> |  | None |

At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and sensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of accuracy with minimal drift in various conditions. In this paper, we question the need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the accuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel encoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope. We denote this algorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry. This work shows that OG odometry can outperform current state-of-the-art radar-inertial SE(2) odometry for a fraction of the computational cost in most scenarios. For example, the OG odometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error of 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%. Lidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the computational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry. To further the analysis, we have pushed the limits of the OG odometry by purposely violating its fundamental no-slip assumption using data collected during a heavy snowstorm with different driving behaviours. Our conclusion shows that a significant amount of slippage is required to result in non-satisfactory pose estimates from the OG odometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics</p></details> | None |

This reduces comfort and trust, potentially slowing broader AV adoption. We propose PACE-ADS (Psychology and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a human-centered autonomy framework that enables AVs to sense, interpret, and respond to both external traffic and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS comprises three foundation model-based agents: a Driver Agent that analyzes the driving context, a Psychologist Agent that interprets occupant psychological signals (e.g., EEG, heart rate, facial expressions) and cognitive commands (e.g., speech), and a Coordinator Agent that integrates these inputs to produce high-level behavior decisions and operational parameters. Rather than replacing existing AV modules, PACE-ADS complements them by operating at the behavioral level, delegating low-level control to native AV systems. This separation enables closed-loop adaptation and supports integration across diverse platforms. We evaluate PACE-ADS in simulation across varied scenarios involving traffic lights, pedestrians, work zones, and car following. Results show that PACE-ADS adapts driving styles to occupant states, improves ride comfort, and enables safe recovery from immobilization via autonomous reasoning or human guidance. Our findings highlight the promise of LLM-based frameworks for bridging the gap between machine autonomy and human-centered driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 fi...</summary><p>10 figures,29 pages, one colummn</p></details> | None |

Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches while having a runtime of only a third.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9190325</p></details> | None |

Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation.

This trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source, synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency, (de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy.

However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over varying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific driving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals representing various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as unfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals. Traditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both domain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are difficult to verify for accuracy. This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that combines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling natural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for specialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap indicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of query results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database querying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for intuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates improved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating dependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.</p></details> |  | None |

While state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on end-to-end deep learning architectures and extensive manual annotations of instances, the significant cost and time investment required for labeling large-scale point cloud datasets remains a major bottleneck in this field. In this work, we demonstrate that competitive panoptic segmentation can be achieved using only semantic labels, with instances predicted without any training or annotations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks including SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and outperforms every publicly available method on SemanticKITTI as a drop-in instance head replacement, while running in real-time on a single-threaded CPU and requiring no instance labels. It is fully explainable, and requires no learning or parameter tuning.

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

However, these models are vulnerable to attacks that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode, where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously. Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46% under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often rely on globally aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations. Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning. Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by 41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.</p></details> |  | None |

Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids, cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture. Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zuosc19.github.io/QuadricFormer/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://zuosc19.github.io/QuadricFormer) |

Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and memory requirements.

Addressing these challenges, we propose a more efficient visual SLAM model, called LRSLAM, utilizing low-rank tensor decomposition methods.

Current tracking algorithms can be divided into two main categories: some approaches introduce complex heuristics and re-identification models to improve the tracking accuracy and reduce the number of identification switches, without particular attention to the timing performance, whereas other approaches are aimed at reducing response times by removing the re-identification phase, thus penalizing the tracking accuracy. This work proposes a new approach to multi-class object tracking that allows achieving smaller and more predictable execution times, without penalizing the tracking performance. The idea is to reduce the problem of matching predictions with detections into smaller sub-problems by splitting the Hungarian matrix by class and invoking the second re-identification stage only when strictly necessary for a smaller number of elements. The proposed solution was evaluated in complex urban scenarios with several objects of different types (as cars, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians), showing the effectiveness of the multi-class approach with respect to state of the art trackers.</p></details> |  | None |

To overcome this, we introduce AgentThink, a pioneering unified framework that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: (i) Structured Data Generation, by establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; (ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and (iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by 53.91% and enhances answer accuracy by 33.54%, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous driving models.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures | None |

We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

An accurate understanding of the road environment aids this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings. We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to comprehensively assess the model performance.

A configuration specifies how software is distributed and replicated: which software components to run on each computer, which software components to replicate, which replication protocols to use, etc. We present an algorithm that, given a system model and resilience requirements, (1) determines initial configurations of the system that are resilient, and (2) generates a reconfiguration policy that determines reconfiguration actions to execute in response to failures and recoveries. This model-finding algorithm is based on state-space exploration and incorporates powerful optimizations, including a quotient reduction based on a novel equivalence relation between states. We present experimental results from successfully applying a prototype implementation of our framework to a model of an autonomous driving system.</p></details> |  | None |

Earlier methods rely on dense BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper, we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split, DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Workshop on Autonomous Driving</p></details> | None |

In particular, interpretability has become increasingly essential for applications that demand high safety and knowledge rigor, such as drug discovery, autonomous driving, and genomics. However, progress in understanding even the simplest deep neural networks - such as fully connected networks - has been limited, despite their role as foundational elements in state-of-the-art models like ResNet and Transformer. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing NeuroLogic, a novel approach for decoding interpretable logic rules from neural networks. NeuroLogic leverages neural activation patterns to capture the model's critical decision-making processes, translating them into logical rules represented by hidden predicates. Thanks to its flexible design in the grounding phase, NeuroLogic can be adapted to a wide range of neural networks. For simple fully connected neural networks, hidden predicates can be grounded in certain split patterns of original input features to derive decision-tree-like rules. For large, complex vision neural networks, NeuroLogic grounds hidden predicates into high-level visual concepts that are understandable to humans. Our empirical study demonstrates that NeuroLogic can extract global and interpretable rules from state-of-the-art models such as ResNet, a task at which existing work struggles. We believe NeuroLogic can help pave the way for understanding the black-box nature of neural networks.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures | None |

However, few studies have looked into the practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model, without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones. To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/ReSim</p></details> | None |

OV-DGSS aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo, a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1) GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

However, existing imitation learning (IL)-based models suffer from generalization to hard cases, and a lack of corrective feedback loop under post-deployment. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential solution to tackle hard cases with optimality, it is often hindered by overfitting to specific driving cases, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge and sample inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose Reinforced Refinement with Self-aware Expansion (R2SE), a novel learning pipeline that constantly refines hard domain while keeping generalizable driving policy for model-agnostic end-to-end driving systems. Through reinforcement fine-tuning and policy expansion that facilitates continuous improvement, R2SE features three key components: 1) Generalist Pretraining with hard-case allocation trains a generalist imitation learning (IL) driving system while dynamically identifying failure-prone cases for targeted refinement; 2) Residual Reinforced Specialist Fine-tuning optimizes residual corrections using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in hard case domain while preserving global driving knowledge; 3) Self-aware Adapter Expansion dynamically integrates specialist policies back into the generalist model, enhancing continuous performance improvement. Experimental results in closed-loop simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate improvements in generalization, safety, and long-horizon policy robustness over state-of-the-art E2E systems, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforce refinement for scalable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Striking the right balance between vehicle dynamics and sensor accuracy is crucial for pushing vehicles to their performance limits. However, autonomous racing developers often face a trade-off between accurate vehicle dynamics and high-fidelity sensor simulations. This paper introduces R-CARLA, an enhancement of the CARLA simulator that supports holistic full-stack testing, from perception to control, using a single system. By seamlessly integrating accurate vehicle dynamics with sensor simulations, opponents simulation as NPCs, and a pipeline for creating digital twins from real-world robotic data, R-CARLA empowers researchers to push the boundaries of autonomous racing development. Furthermore, it is developed using CARLA's rich suite of sensor simulations. Our results indicate that incorporating the proposed digital-twin framework into R-CARLA enables more realistic full-stack testing, demonstrating a significant reduction in the Sim-to-Real gap of car dynamics simulation by 42% and by 82% in the case of sensor simulation across various testing scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurate forecasting requires models to consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models, improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when integrated with the proposed module.

However, existing benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes. AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria: comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level, point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.</p></details> |  | None |

To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts.

However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.</p></details> |  | None |

Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles. By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset, where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks, including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various testing sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops, 3DMM - 3D Multimedia Analytics, Search and Generation</p></details> | None |

Most existing methods, however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand, points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention, which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG. Moreover, ODG also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds.

However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> | None |

The RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges, including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and (2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably, the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official test set using Gemini 2.5 Pro.

| **[Perception Characteristics Distance: Measuring Stability and Robustness of Perception System in Dynamic Conditions under a Certain Decision Rule](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09217v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of perception systems in autonomous driving systems (ADS) is strongly influenced by object distance, scene dynamics, and environmental conditions such as weather. AI-based perception outputs are inherently stochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while traditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to capture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected, incorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear and daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target objects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the variance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD values across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic thresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall perception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance. Applying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful reliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that static metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation, while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation. The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenwheels/sensorrainfall, and the evaluation code is open-sourced at https://github.com/datadrivenwheels/PCD_Python.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/datadrivenwheels/PCD_Python) |
| **[Causality-aware Safety Testing for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08688v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing is essential for evaluating the safety of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs). Comprehensive evaluation requires testing across diverse scenarios that can trigger various types of violations under different conditions. While existing methods typically focus on individual diversity metrics, such as input scenarios, ADS-generated motion commands, and system violations, they often fail to capture the complex interrelationships among these elements. This oversight leads to gaps in testing coverage, potentially missing critical issues in the ADS under evaluation. However, quantifying these interrelationships presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel causality-aware fuzzing technique, Causal-Fuzzer, to enable efficient and comprehensive testing of ADSs by exploring causally diverse scenarios. The core of Causal-Fuzzer is constructing a causal graph to model the interrelationships among the diversities of input scenarios, ADS motion commands, and system violations. Then the causal graph will guide the process of critical scenario generation. Specifically, Causal-Fuzzer proposes (1) a causality-based feedback mechanism that quantifies the combined diversity of test scenarios by assessing whether they activate new causal relationships, and (2) a causality-driven mutation strategy that prioritizes mutations on input scenario elements with higher causal impact on ego action changes and violation occurrence, rather than treating all elements equally. We evaluated Causal-Fuzzer on an industry-grade ADS Apollo, with a high-fidelity. Our empirical results demonstrate that Causal-Fuzzer significantly outperforms existing methods in (1) identifying a greater diversity of violations, (2) providing enhanced testing sufficiency with improved coverage of causal relationships, and (3) achieving greater efficiency in detecting the first critical scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Predictability Awareness for Efficient and Robust Multi-Agent Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06223v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To safely and efficiently solve motion planning problems in multi-agent settings, most approaches attempt to solve a joint optimization that explicitly accounts for the responses triggered in other agents. This often results in solutions with an exponential computational complexity, making these methods intractable for complex scenarios with many agents. While sequential predict-and-plan approaches are more scalable, they tend to perform poorly in highly interactive environments. This paper proposes a method to improve the interactive capabilities of sequential predict-and-plan methods in multi-agent navigation problems by introducing predictability as an optimization objective. We interpret predictability through the use of general prediction models, by allowing agents to predict themselves and estimate how they align with these external predictions. We formally introduce this behavior through the free-energy of the system, which reduces under appropriate bounds to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between plan and prediction, and use this as a penalty for unpredictable trajectories.The proposed interpretation of predictability allows agents to more robustly leverage prediction models, and fosters a soft social convention that accelerates agreement on coordination strategies without the need of explicit high level control or communication. We show how this predictability-aware planning leads to lower-cost trajectories and reduces planning effort in a set of multi-robot problems, including autonomous driving experiments with human driver data, where we show that the benefits of considering predictability apply even when only the ego-agent uses this strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos and other additional materials can be found at https://romanchiva.github.io/PAProjectPage/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://romanchiva.github.io/PAProjectPage) |

We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.</p></details> |  | None |

However, each existing PAP typically supports only a single, fixed attack goal, and switching to a different objective requires re-generating and re-deploying a new PAP. This rigidity limits their practicality in dynamic environments like autonomous driving, where traffic conditions and attack goals can change rapidly. For example, if no obstacles are present around the target vehicle, the attack may fail to cause meaningful consequences. To overcome this limitation, we propose SwitchPatch, a novel PAP that is static yet enables dynamic and controllable attack outcomes based on real-time scenarios. Attackers can alter pre-defined conditions, e.g., by projecting different natural-color lights onto SwitchPatch to seamlessly switch between attack goals. Unlike prior work, SwitchPatch does not require re-generation or re-deployment for different objectives, significantly reducing cost and complexity. Furthermore, SwitchPatch remains benign when the enabling conditions are absent, enhancing its stealth. We evaluate SwitchPatch on two key tasks: traffic sign recognition (classification and detection) and depth estimation. First, we conduct theoretical analysis and empirical studies to demonstrate the feasibility of SwitchPatch and explore how many goals it can support using techniques like color light projection and occlusion. Second, we perform simulation-based experiments and ablation studies to verify its effectiveness and transferability. Third, we conduct outdoor tests using a Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to confirm its robustness in the physical world. Overall, SwitchPatch introduces a flexible and practical adversarial strategy that can be adapted to diverse tasks and real-world conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we train a denoising diffusion model to generate potential failure cases of an autonomous vehicle given any initial traffic state. Experiments on a four-way intersection problem show that in a variety of scenarios, the diffusion model can generate realistic failure samples while capturing a wide variety of potential failures. Our model does not require any external training dataset, can perform training and inference with modest computing resources, and does not assume any prior knowledge of the system under test, with applicability to safety validation for traffic intersections.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Scaling Laws of Motion Forecasting and Planning -- A Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08228v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.</p></details> |  | None |

MARL is known to suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity} issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed, which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop {\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap. Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of using \textit{CALL}.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6 and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA by 5.6 PDMS.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto (GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world deployment at scale.</p></details> |  | None |

However, methods based on reinforcement learning and imitation learning often suffer from high sample complexity, poor generalization, and low safety. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an efficient and generalized end-to-end autonomous driving system (EGADS) for complex and varied scenarios. The RL agent in our EGADS combines variational inference with normalizing flows, which are independent of distribution assumptions. This combination allows the agent to capture historical information relevant to driving in latent space effectively, thereby significantly reducing sample complexity. Additionally, we enhance safety by formulating robust safety constraints and improve generalization and performance by integrating RL with expert demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EGADS significantly reduces sample complexity, greatly improves safety performance, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities in complex urban scenarios. Particularly, we contributed an expert dataset collected through human expert steering wheel control, specifically using the G29 steering wheel.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML PKDD 2025 (Research Track)</p></details> | None |

Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast, neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2 significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see https://research.zenseact.com/publications/R3D2/.</p></details> |  | None |

Two-agent conflicts are assessed by detecting and classifying conflict type, identifying the agents' roles (initiator or responder), identifying the point of reaction of the responder, and modeling their human behavioral expectations as probabilistic counterfactual trajectories. The states are used to compute velocity differentials at collision, which when combined with crash models, estimates severity of loss in terms of probabilistic injury or property damage, henceforth called fractional collisions. The probabilistic models may also be extended to include other uncertainties associated with the simulation, features, and agents. We verify the effectiveness of the methodology in a synthetic simulation environment using reconstructed trajectories from 300+ collision and near-collision scenes sourced from VTTI's SHRP2 database and Nexar dashboard camera data. Our methodology predicted fractional collisions within 1% of ground truth collisions. We then evaluate agent-initiated collision risk of an arbitrary ADS software release by replacing the naturalistic responder in these synthetic reconstructions with an ADS simulator and comparing the outcome to human-response outcomes. Our ADS reduced naturalistic collisions by 4x and fractional collision risk by ~62%. The framework's utility is also demonstrated on 250k miles of proprietary, open-loop sensor data collected on ADS test vehicles, re-simulated with an arbitrary ADS software release. The ADS initiated conflicts that caused 0.4 injury-causing and 1.7 property-damaging fractional collisions, and the ADS improved collision risk in 96% of the agent-initiated conflicts.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data.DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings.

To improve model transparency and training flexibility, this paper proposes a hierarchical and decoupled post-training framework tailored for pretrained neural networks. By reconstructing intermediate feature maps from ground-truth labels, surrogate supervisory signals are introduced at transitional layers to enable independent training of specific components, thereby avoiding the complexity and coupling of conventional end-to-end backpropagation and providing interpretable insights into networks' internal mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to formalize feature-level reverse computation as well-posed optimization problems, which we rigorously reformulate as systems of linear equations or least squares problems. This establishes a novel and efficient training paradigm that extends gradient backpropagation to feature backpropagation. Extensive experiments on multiple standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior generalization performance and computational efficiency compared to traditional training approaches, validating its effectiveness and potential.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures, | None |

Nonetheless, these datasets often encounter challenges related to the states of traffic signals, such as missing or inaccurate data. Such issues can compromise the reliability of the datasets and adversely affect the performance of models developed using them. This research introduces a fully automated approach designed to tackle these issues by utilizing available vehicle trajectory data alongside knowledge from the transportation domain to effectively impute and rectify traffic signal information within the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). The proposed method is robust and flexible, capable of handling diverse intersection geometries and traffic signal configurations in real-world scenarios. Comprehensive validations have been conducted on the entire WOMD, focusing on over 360,000 relevant scenarios involving traffic signals, out of a total of 530,000 real-world driving scenarios. In the original dataset, 71.7% of traffic signal states are either missing or unknown, all of which were successfully imputed by our proposed method. Furthermore, in the absence of ground-truth signal states, the accuracy of our approach is evaluated based on the rate of red-light violations among vehicle trajectories. Results show that our method reduces the estimated red-light running rate from 15.7% in the original data to 2.9%, thereby demonstrating its efficacy in rectifying data inaccuracies.

Despite its impressive algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies. First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design, effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process, we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we introduce a $\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\sim27.8\times$ and energy savings of $28.8\sim51.4\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on deployment-specific tuning or predefined motion priors, our approach generalizes effectively across a wide range of real-world scenarios, including autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, mobile robots, and handheld devices. To this end, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for local state estimation, with several specialized decoders that each handle a distinct class of ego-motion patterns. Moreover, we introduce a fully differentiable Gumbel-Softmax module that constructs a robust inter-frame correlation graph, selects the optimal expert decoder, and prunes erroneous estimates. These cues are then fed into a unified back-end that combines pre-trained, scale-independent depth priors with a lightweight bundling adjustment to enforce geometric consistency. We extensively evaluate our method on three major benchmark datasets: KITTI (outdoor/autonomous driving), EuRoC-MAV (indoor/aerial drones), and TUM-RGBD (indoor/handheld), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 15pages, 8 figures | None |

Most existing methods, however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand, points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, BePo, which combines BEV and sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention, which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BePo. Moreover, BePo also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Two-p...</summary><p>Two-page abstract version available at CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> | None |

Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes. While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes (GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more accurate than the state of the art.</p></details> |  | None |

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Different from existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, enhancing the performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the network the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future, and further improves the performance. With experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[LLM-attacker: Enhancing Closed-loop Adversarial Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15850v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring and improving the safety of autonomous driving systems (ADS) is crucial for the deployment of highly automated vehicles, especially in safety-critical events. To address the rarity issue, adversarial scenario generation methods are developed, in which behaviors of traffic participants are manipulated to induce safety-critical events. However, existing methods still face two limitations. First, identification of the adversarial participant directly impacts the effectiveness of the generation. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios, with numerous participants and diverse behaviors, makes identification challenging. Second, the potential of generated safety-critical scenarios to continuously improve ADS performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we propose LLM-attacker: a closed-loop adversarial scenario generation framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). Specifically, multiple LLM agents are designed and coordinated to identify optimal attackers. Then, the trajectories of the attackers are optimized to generate adversarial scenarios. These scenarios are iteratively refined based on the performance of ADS, forming a feedback loop to improve ADS. Experimental results show that LLM-attacker can create more dangerous scenarios than other methods, and the ADS trained with it achieves a collision rate half that of training with normal scenarios. This indicates the ability of LLM-attacker to test and enhance the safety and robustness of ADS.

These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.</p></details> |  | None |

A key component is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal trajectory from these candidates. While recent trajectory scorers focus on scoring either large sets of static trajectories or small sets of dynamically generated ones, both approaches face significant limitations in generalization. Static vocabularies provide effective coarse discretization but struggle to make fine-grained adaptation, while dynamic proposals offer detailed precision but fail to capture broader trajectory distributions. To overcome these challenges, we propose GTRS (Generalized Trajectory Scoring), a unified framework for end-to-end multi-modal planning that combines coarse and fine-grained trajectory evaluation. GTRS consists of three complementary innovations: (1) a diffusion-based trajectory generator that produces diverse fine-grained proposals; (2) a vocabulary generalization technique that trains a scorer on super-dense trajectory sets with dropout regularization, enabling its robust inference on smaller subsets; and (3) a sensor augmentation strategy that enhances out-of-domain generalization while incorporating refinement training for critical trajectory discrimination. As the winning solution of the Navsim v2 Challenge, GTRS demonstrates superior performance even with sub-optimal sensor inputs, approaching privileged methods that rely on ground-truth perception.

Traditional on-board perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots, while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time, multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency, edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE EDGE 2025.

From a safety perspective, sensor calibration is a key enabler of autonomous driving. In the current state of the art, a trend from target-based offline calibration towards targetless online calibration can be observed. However, online calibration is subject to strict real-time and resource constraints which are not met by state-of-the-art methods. This is mainly due to the high number of parameters to estimate, the reliance on geometric features, or the dependence on specific vehicle maneuvers. To meet these requirements and ensure the vehicle's safety at any time, we propose a miscalibration detection framework that shifts the focus from the direct regression of calibration parameters to a binary classification of the calibration state, i.e., calibrated or miscalibrated. Therefore, we propose a contrastive learning approach that compares embedded features in a latent space to classify the calibration state of two different sensor modalities. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the feature embeddings and challenging calibration errors that highlight the performance of our approach. As a result, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of detection performance, inference time, and resource demand. The code is open source and available on https://github.com/TUMFTM/MiscalibrationDetection.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/TUMFTM/MiscalibrationDetection) |

The framework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset using ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for efficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model evaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first benchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs based on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target off-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint and focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk assessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert VLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or LiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle actions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios spanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified multiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings in existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in complex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for architectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By addressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the development of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ivc-lrp/STSBench, Code: https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/LRP-IVC/STSBench) |

An expressive representation for this purpose is Occupancy Flow Fields, which provide a scalable and unified format for modeling motion, spatial extent, and multi-modal future distributions. While recent methods have achieved strong results using this representation, they often depend on high-quality vectorized inputs, which are unavailable or difficult to generate in practice, and the use of transformer-based architectures, which are computationally intensive and costly to deploy. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Coupled Convolutional LSTM (CCLSTM)}, a lightweight, end-to-end trainable architecture based solely on convolutional operations. Without relying on vectorized inputs or self-attention mechanisms, CCLSTM effectively captures temporal dynamics and spatial occupancy-flow correlations using a compact recurrent convolutional structure. Despite its simplicity, CCLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on occupancy flow metrics and, as of this submission, ranks \(1^{\text{st}}\) in all metrics on the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge leaderboard.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self driving algorithm for an active four wheel drive racecar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06077v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling autonomous vehicles at their handling limits is a significant challenge, particularly for electric vehicles with active four wheel drive (A4WD) systems offering independent wheel torque control. While traditional Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) methods use complex physics-based models, this study explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop a unified, high-performance controller. We employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train an agent for optimal lap times in a simulated racecar (TORCS) at the tire grip limit. Critically, the agent learns an end-to-end policy that directly maps vehicle states, like velocities, accelerations, and yaw rate, to a steering angle command and independent torque commands for each of the four wheels. This formulation bypasses conventional pedal inputs and explicit torque vectoring algorithms, allowing the agent to implicitly learn the A4WD control logic needed for maximizing performance and stability. Simulation results demonstrate the RL agent learns sophisticated strategies, dynamically optimizing wheel torque distribution corner-by-corner to enhance handling and mitigate the vehicle's inherent understeer. The learned behaviors mimic and, in aspects of grip utilization, potentially surpass traditional physics-based A4WD controllers while achieving competitive lap times. This research underscores DRL's potential to create adaptive control systems for complex vehicle dynamics, suggesting RL is a potent alternative for advancing autonomous driving in demanding, grip-limited scenarios for racing and road safety.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SafeAuto: Knowledge-Enhanced Safe Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00211v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional autonomous driving systems often struggle to connect high-level reasoning with low-level control, leading to suboptimal and sometimes unsafe behaviors. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which process both visual and textual data, offer an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. First, we introduce a Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss to improve low-level control signal predictions when values are represented as text. Second, to explicitly integrate safety knowledge, we develop a reasoning component that translates traffic rules into first-order logic (e.g., "red light $\implies$ stop") and embeds them into a probabilistic graphical model (e.g., Markov Logic Network) to verify predicted actions using recognized environmental attributes. Additionally, our Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model leverages video, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn from past driving experiences. Integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets, enabling more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving.

While semi-supervised segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models. Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world deployment needs.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Trajectory Entropy: Modeling Game State Stability from Multimodality Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05810v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels. However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for planning.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

Our method effectively leverages high-resolution camera images to train radar depth map generative models, addressing the limitations of conventional radar detectors in complex vehicular environments, thus sharpening the radar output. We develop spectrum estimation algorithms tailored for radar depth maps and RGB images, a comprehensive training framework for data-driven generative models, and a camera-radar deployment scheme for AV operation.

Remarkable work has been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities, resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and localization of map elements, only point information is used without the consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation. And then, local features from point queries and global features from element queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local geometric information between points of the same element and of each point, Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points. Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under hard/easy settings, respectively.

However, troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with 0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20% accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally, ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g., weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks.

However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet.

Although existing methods have primarily focused on detecting anomalous objects in videos -- either by identifying anomalous frames or objects -- they often neglect finer-grained analysis, such as anomalous pixels, which limits their ability to capture a broader range of anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework called Track Any Anomalous Object (TAO), which introduces a granular video anomaly detection pipeline that, for the first time, integrates the detection of multiple fine-grained anomalous objects into a unified framework. Unlike methods that assign anomaly scores to every pixel, our approach transforms the problem into pixel-level tracking of anomalous objects. By linking anomaly scores to downstream tasks such as segmentation and tracking, our method removes the need for threshold tuning and achieves more precise anomaly localization in long and complex video sequences. Experiments demonstrate that TAO sets new benchmarks in accuracy and robustness. Project page available online.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional methods often face difficulties in balancing these constraints, leading to either diminished performance or increased safety risks. We address these issues with a novel approach that begins by learning a conservatively safe policy through the use of Conditional Variational Autoencoders, which model the latent safety constraints. Subsequently, we frame this as a Constrained Reward-Return Maximization problem, wherein the policy aims to optimize rewards while complying with the inferred latent safety constraints. This is achieved by training an encoder with a reward-Advantage Weighted Regression objective within the latent constraint space. Our methodology is supported by theoretical analysis, including bounds on policy performance and sample complexity. Extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, including challenging autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrates that our approach not only maintains safety compliance but also excels in cumulative reward optimization, surpassing existing methods.

This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy, with maximum gains of up to 44%.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[Pseudo-Simulation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04218v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation.

In this work, a reinforcement learning based lateral control approach, despite the imperfections in the vehicle models due to measurement errors and simplifications, is presented. Our approach ensures comfortable, efficient, and robust control performance considering the interface between controlling and other modules. The controller consists of the conventional Model Predictive Control (MPC)-PID part as the basis and the demonstrator, and the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) part which leverages the online information from the MPC-PID part. The controller's performance is evaluated in CARLA using the ground truth of the waypoints as inputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller when vehicle information is incomplete, and the training of DRL can be stabilized with the demonstration part. These findings highlight the potential to reduce development and integration efforts for autonomous driving pipelines in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; Accepted for publication at the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Cluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive MPC with Conformalized Neural Network Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02436v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SODA-MPC, a Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive Model Predictive Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction, with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for training and calibration.</p></details> |  | None |

However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for $\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation $\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RAC3: Retrieval-Augmented Corner Case Comprehension for Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11050v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[Confidence-Guided Human-AI Collaboration: Reinforcement Learning with Distributional Proxy Value Propagation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03568v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving promises significant advancements in mobility, road safety and traffic efficiency, yet reinforcement learning and imitation learning face safe-exploration and distribution-shift challenges. Although human-AI collaboration alleviates these issues, it often relies heavily on extensive human intervention, which increases costs and reduces efficiency. This paper develops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to overcome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value propagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC) framework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions C-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal human interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to integrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that maximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently and continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a policy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return distribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and self-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This ensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and performance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios reveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated through real-world road tests in complex traffic conditions.

| **[Channel-adaptive Cross-modal Generative Semantic Communication for Point Cloud Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03211v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of autonomous driving and extended reality, efficient transmission of point clouds (PCs) has become increasingly important. In this context, we propose a novel channel-adaptive cross-modal generative semantic communication (SemCom) for PC transmission, called GenSeC-PC. GenSeC-PC employs a semantic encoder that fuses images and point clouds, where images serve as non-transmitted side information. Meanwhile, the decoder is built upon the backbone of PointDif. Such a cross-modal design not only ensures high compression efficiency but also delivers superior reconstruction performance compared to PointDif. Moreover, to ensure robust transmission and reduce system complexity, we design a streamlined and asymmetric channel-adaptive joint semantic-channel coding architecture, where only the encoder needs the feedback of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and available bandwidth. In addition, rectified denoising diffusion implicit models is employed to accelerate the decoding process to the millisecond level, enabling real-time PC communication. Unlike existing methods, GenSeC-PC leverages generative priors to ensure reliable reconstruction even from noisy or incomplete source PCs. More importantly, it supports fully analog transmission, improving compression efficiency by eliminating the need for error-free side information transmission common in prior SemCom approaches. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of cross-modal semantic extraction and dual-metric guided fine-tuning, highlighting the framework's robustness across diverse conditions, including low SNR, bandwidth limitations, varying numbers of 2D images, and previously unseen objects.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike prior generative or physics-based simulators, SA-Radar integrates both paradigms through a waveform-parameterized attribute embedding. We design ICFAR-Net, a 3D U-Net conditioned on radar attributes encoded via waveform parameters, which captures signal variations induced by different radar configurations. This formulation bypasses the need for detailed radar hardware specifications and allows efficient simulation of range-azimuth-Doppler (RAD) tensors across diverse sensor settings. We further construct a mixed real-simulated dataset with attribute annotations to robustly train the network. Extensive evaluations on multiple downstream tasks-including 2D/3D object detection and radar semantic segmentation-demonstrate that SA-Radar's simulated data is both realistic and effective, consistently improving model performance when used standalone or in combination with real data. Our framework also supports simulation in novel sensor viewpoints and edited scenes, showcasing its potential as a general-purpose radar data engine for autonomous driving applications.

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from labeled synthetic data to unlabeled real-world data. While UDA methods for synthetic to real-world domains (synth-to-real) excel in tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection, their application to instance segmentation for autonomous driving remains underexplored and often relies on suboptimal baselines. We introduce UDA4Inst, a powerful framework for synth-to-real UDA in instance segmentation. Our framework enhances instance segmentation through Semantic Category Training and Bidirectional Mixing Training. Semantic Category Training groups semantically related classes for separate training, improving pseudo-label quality and segmentation accuracy. Bidirectional Mixing Training combines instance-wise and patch-wise data mixing, creating coherent composites that enhance generalization across domains. Extensive experiments show UDA4Inst sets a new state-of-the-art on the SYNTHIA-> Cityscapes benchmark (mAP 31.3) and introduces results on novel datasets, using UrbanSyn and Synscapes as sources and Cityscapes and KITTI360 as targets.

| **[Online Performance Assessment of Multi-Source-Localization for Autonomous Driving Systems Using Subjective Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02932v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving (AD) relies heavily on high precision localization as a crucial part of all driving related software components. The precise positioning is necessary for the utilization of high-definition maps, prediction of other road participants and the controlling of the vehicle itself. Due to this reason, the localization is absolutely safety relevant. Typical errors of the localization systems, which are long term drifts, jumps and false localization, that must be detected to enhance safety. An online assessment and evaluation of the current localization performance is a challenging task, which is usually done by Kalman filtering for single localization systems. Current autonomous vehicles cope with these challenges by fusing multiple individual localization methods into an overall state estimation. Such approaches need expert knowledge for a competitive performance in challenging environments. This expert knowledge is based on the trust and the prioritization of distinct localization methods in respect to the current situation and environment. This work presents a novel online performance assessment technique of multiple localization systems by using subjective logic (SL). In our research vehicles, three different systems for localization are available, namely odometry-, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM)- and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based. Our performance assessment models the behavior of these three localization systems individually and puts them into reference of each other. The experiments were carried out using the CoCar NextGen, which is based on an Audi A6. The vehicle's localization system was evaluated under challenging conditions, specifically within a tunnel environment. The overall evaluation shows the feasibility of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE IAVVC 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Functionality Assessment Framework for Autonomous Driving Systems using Subjective Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02922v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex autonomous driving (AD) software systems, the functioning of each system part is crucial for safe operation. By measuring the current functionality or operability of individual components an isolated glimpse into the system is given. Literature provides several of these detached assessments, often in the form of safety or performance measures. But dependencies, redundancies, error propagation and conflicting functionality statements do not allow for easy combination of these measures into a big picture of the functioning of the entire AD stack. Data is processed and exchanged between different components, each of which can fail, making an overall statement challenging. The lack of functionality assessment frameworks that tackle these problems underlines this complexity. This article presents a novel framework for inferring an overall functionality statement for complex component based systems by considering their dependencies, redundancies, error propagation paths and the assessments of individual components. Our framework first incorporates a comprehensive conversion to an assessment representation of the system. The representation is based on Subjective Networks (SNs) that allow for easy identification of faulty system parts. Second, the framework offers a flexible method for computing the system's functionality while dealing with contradicting assessments about the same component and dependencies, as well as redundancies, of the system. We discuss the framework's capabilities on real-life data of our AD stack with assessments of various components.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines: A Benchmark through 3D LiDAR Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02914v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial yet under-appreciated prerequisite in machine learning solutions for real-applications is data annotation: human annotators are hired to manually label data according to detailed, expert-crafted guidelines. This is often a laborious, tedious, and costly process. To study methods for facilitating data annotation, we introduce a new benchmark AnnoGuide: Auto-Annotation from Annotation Guidelines. It aims to evaluate automated methods for data annotation directly from expert-defined annotation guidelines, eliminating the need for manual labeling. As a case study, we repurpose the well-established nuScenes dataset, commonly used in autonomous driving research, which provides comprehensive annotation guidelines for labeling LiDAR point clouds with 3D cuboids across 18 object classes. These guidelines include a few visual examples and textual descriptions, but no labeled 3D cuboids in LiDAR data, making this a novel task of multi-modal few-shot 3D detection without 3D annotations. The advances of powerful foundation models (FMs) make AnnoGuide especially timely, as FMs offer promising tools to tackle its challenges. We employ a conceptually straightforward pipeline that (1) utilizes open-source FMs for object detection and segmentation in RGB images, (2) projects 2D detections into 3D using known camera poses, and (3) clusters LiDAR points within the frustum of each 2D detection to generate a 3D cuboid. Starting with a non-learned solution that leverages off-the-shelf FMs, we progressively refine key components and achieve significant performance improvements, boosting 3D detection mAP from 12.1 to 21.9! Nevertheless, our results highlight that AnnoGuide remains an open and challenging problem, underscoring the urgent need for developing LiDAR-based FMs. We release our code and models at GitHub: https://annoguide.github.io/annoguide3Dbenchmark</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://annoguide.github.io/annoguide3Dbenchmark) |

Our approach to this challenge prioritizes three key aspects: first, parameter efficiency to maintain the inherent generalization capability of SAM; second, fine-grained and input-aware robustification to precisely address the input corruption; and third, adherence to standard training protocols for ease of training. To this end, we propose gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module. This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without compromising the generalization capability of SAM. Our model, GaRA-SAM, significantly outperforms prior work on all robust segmentation benchmarks. In particular, it surpasses the previous best IoU score by up to 21.3\%p on ACDC, a challenging real corrupted image dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

Despite the availability of various facial RGB datasets, the thermal modality, which plays a crucial role in life sciences, medicine, and biometrics, has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce the T-FAKE dataset, a new large-scale synthetic thermal dataset with sparse and dense landmarks. To facilitate the creation of the dataset, we propose a novel RGB2Thermal loss function, which enables the domain-adaptive transfer of RGB faces to thermal style. By utilizing the Wasserstein distance between thermal and RGB patches and the statistical analysis of clinical temperature distributions on faces, we ensure that the generated thermal images closely resemble real samples. Using RGB2Thermal style transfer based on our RGB2Thermal loss function, we create the large-scale synthetic thermal T-FAKE dataset with landmark and segmentation annotations. Leveraging our novel T-FAKE dataset, probabilistic landmark prediction, and label adaptation networks, we demonstrate significant improvements in landmark detection methods on thermal images across different landmark conventions. Our models show excellent performance with both sparse 70-point landmarks and dense 478-point landmark annotations. Moreover, our RGB2Thermal loss leads to notable results in terms of perceptual evaluation and temperature prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures, Philipp Flotho and Moritz Piening share equal contribution</p></details> | None |

However, existing frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations, highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the interpretability of driving decisions.

Traditional calibration methods require extensive data collection in controlled environments and cannot compensate for the transformation changes during the vehicle/robot movement. In this paper, we propose the first model that uses bird's-eye view (BEV) features to perform LiDAR camera calibration from raw data, termed BEVCALIB. To achieve this, we extract camera BEV features and LiDAR BEV features separately and fuse them into a shared BEV feature space. To fully utilize the geometric information from the BEV feature, we introduce a novel feature selector to filter the most important features in the transformation decoder, which reduces memory consumption and enables efficient training. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, NuScenes, and our own dataset demonstrate that BEVCALIB establishes a new state of the art. Under various noise conditions, BEVCALIB outperforms the best baseline in the literature by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI dataset, and (78.17%, 68.29%) on NuScenes dataset, in terms of (translation, rotation), respectively.

To address these issues, this paper introduces V2X-UniPool, a unified framework that integrates multimodal Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) data into a time-indexed and language-based knowledge pool. By leveraging a dual-query Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, which enables retrieval of both static and dynamic knowledge, our system enables ADs to perform accurate, temporally consistent reasoning over both static environment and dynamic traffic context. Experiments on a real-world cooperative driving dataset demonstrate that V2X-UniPool significantly enhances motion planning accuracy and reasoning capability. Remarkably, it enables even zero-shot vehicle-side models to achieve state-of-the-art performance by leveraging V2X-UniPool, while simultaneously reducing transmission cost by over 99.9\% compared to prior V2X methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to its ability to effectively enhance road safety and traffic management, it has received widespread attention in recent years. In autonomous driving, accurate RSC allows vehicles to better understand the road environment, adjust driving strategies, and ensure a safer and more efficient driving experience. For a long time, vision-based RSC has been favored. However, existing visual classification methods have overlooked the exploration of fine-grained classification of pavement types (such as similar pavement textures). In this work, we propose a pure vision-based fine-grained RSC method for autonomous driving scenarios, which fuses local and global feature information through the stacking of convolutional and transformer modules. We further explore the stacking strategies of local and global feature extraction modules to find the optimal feature extraction strategy. In addition, since fine-grained tasks also face the challenge of relatively large intra-class differences and relatively small inter-class differences, we propose a Foreground-Background Module (FBM) that effectively extracts fine-grained context features of the pavement, enhancing the classification ability for complex pavements. Experiments conducted on a large-scale pavement dataset containing one million samples and a simplified dataset reorganized from this dataset achieved Top-1 classification accuracies of 92.52% and 96.50%, respectively, improving by 5.69% to 12.84% compared to SOTA methods. These results demonstrate that RoadFormer outperforms existing methods in RSC tasks, providing significant progress in improving the reliability of pavement perception in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time.

Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Survey of 3D Reconstruction with Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08438v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras are rapidly emerging as powerful vision sensors for 3D reconstruction, uniquely capable of asynchronously capturing per-pixel brightness changes. Compared to traditional frame-based cameras, event cameras produce sparse yet temporally dense data streams, enabling robust and accurate 3D reconstruction even under challenging conditions such as high-speed motion, low illumination, and extreme dynamic range scenarios. These capabilities offer substantial promise for transformative applications across various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, aerial navigation, and immersive virtual reality. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review exclusively dedicated to event-based 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches are systematically categorised based on input modality into stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classified according to reconstruction methodologies, including geometry-based techniques, deep learning approaches, and neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Within each category, methods are chronologically organised to highlight the evolution of key concepts and advancements. Furthermore, we provide a detailed summary of publicly available datasets specifically suited to event-based reconstruction tasks. Finally, we discuss significant open challenges in dataset availability, standardised evaluation, effective representation, and dynamic scene reconstruction, outlining insightful directions for future research. This survey aims to serve as an essential reference and provides a clear and motivating roadmap toward advancing the state of the art in event-driven 3D reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</p></details> | None |

However, previous work has focused on static warning systems that do not accommodate different driver states. Therefore, we propose an adaptive takeover warning system that is personalised to drivers, enhancing their experience and safety. We conducted two user studies investigating semi-autonomous driving scenarios in rural and urban environments while participants performed non-driving-related tasks such as text entry and visual search. We investigated the effects of varying time budgets and head-up versus head-down displays for takeover requests on drivers' situational awareness and mental state. Through our statistical and clustering analyses, we propose strategies for designing adaptable takeover systems, e.g., using longer time budgets and head-up displays for non-hazardous takeover events in high-complexity environments while using shorter time budgets and head-down displays for hazardous events in low-complexity environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing real-time scheduling and response-time analysis techniques for ROS 2 focus on applications written in C++ and do not address the unique execution models and challenges presented by Rust's asynchronous programming paradigm. In this paper, we analyze the execution model of R2R -- an asynchronous Rust ROS 2 bindings and various asynchronous Rust runtimes, comparing them with the execution model of C++ ROS 2 applications. We propose a structured approach for R2R applications aimed at deterministic real-time operation involving thread prioritization and callback-to-thread mapping schemes. Our experimental evaluation based on measuring end-to-end latencies of a synthetic application shows that the proposed approach is effective and outperforms other evaluated configurations. A more complex autonomous driving case study demonstrates its practical applicability. Overall, the experimental results indicate that our proposed structure achieves bounded response times for time-critical tasks. This paves the way for future work to adapt existing or develop new response-time analysis techniques for R2R applications using our structure.</p></details> |  | None |

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices.

This allows simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed, noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis. To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR / 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy), demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and scene reconstruction.

| **[The Actor-Critic Update Order Matters for PPO in Federated Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01261v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), applying Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) faces challenges related to the update order of its actor and critic due to the aggregation step occurring between successive iterations. In particular, when local actors are updated based on local critic estimations, the algorithm becomes vulnerable to data heterogeneity. As a result, the conventional update order in PPO (critic first, then actor) may cause heterogeneous gradient directions among clients, hindering convergence to a globally optimal policy. To address this issue, we propose FedRAC, which reverses the update order (actor first, then critic) to eliminate the divergence of critics from different clients. Theoretical analysis shows that the convergence bound of FedRAC is immune to data heterogeneity under mild conditions, i.e., bounded level of heterogeneity and accurate policy evaluation. Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains higher cumulative rewards and converges more rapidly in five experiments, including three classical RL environments and a highly heterogeneous autonomous driving scenario using the SUMO traffic simulator.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Pseudo-Labeling Driven Refinement of Benchmark Object Detection Datasets via Analysis of Learning Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00997v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark object detection (OD) datasets play a pivotal role in advancing computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, and surveillance, as well as in training and evaluating deep learning-based state-of-the-art detection models. Among them, MS-COCO has become a standard benchmark due to its diverse object categories and complex scenes. However, despite its wide adoption, MS-COCO suffers from various annotation issues, including missing labels, incorrect class assignments, inaccurate bounding boxes, duplicate labels, and group labeling inconsistencies. These errors not only hinder model training but also degrade the reliability and generalization of OD models. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive refinement framework and present MJ-COCO, a newly re-annotated version of MS-COCO. Our approach begins with loss and gradient-based error detection to identify potentially mislabeled or hard-to-learn samples. Next, we apply a four-stage pseudo-labeling refinement process: (1) bounding box generation using invertible transformations, (2) IoU-based duplicate removal and confidence merging, (3) class consistency verification via expert objects recognizer, and (4) spatial adjustment based on object region activation map analysis. This integrated pipeline enables scalable and accurate correction of annotation errors without manual re-labeling. Extensive experiments were conducted across four validation datasets: MS-COCO, Sama COCO, Objects365, and PASCAL VOC. Models trained on MJ-COCO consistently outperformed those trained on MS-COCO, achieving improvements in Average Precision (AP) and APS metrics. MJ-COCO also demonstrated significant gains in annotation coverage: for example, the number of small object annotations increased by more than 200,000 compared to MS-COCO.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions.

Recent advances to align the views rely on high-density LiDAR data or fine-grained image feature representations, which however fail to meet the requirements of accuracy, real-time, and adaptability for autonomous driving. To this end, we present MMatch, a lightweight system that enables accurate and real-time perception fusion with mmWave radar point clouds. The key insight is that fine-grained spatial information provided by the radar present unique associations with all the vehicles even in two separate views. As a result, by capturing and understanding the unique local and global position of the targets in this association, we can quickly find out all the co-visible vehicles for view alignment. We implement MMatch on both the datasets collected from the CARLA platform and the real-world traffic with over 15,000 radar point cloud pairs. Experimental results show that MMatch achieves decimeter-level accuracy within 59ms, which significantly improves the reliability for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE INFOCOM 2025</p></details> | None |

While recent vision-language-guided reinforcement learning (RL) methods introduce semantic feedback, they often rely on static prompts and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to dynamic driving scenes. We present DriveMind, a unified semantic reward framework that integrates: (i) a contrastive Vision-Language Model (VLM) encoder for stepwise semantic anchoring; (ii) a novelty-triggered VLM encoder-decoder, fine-tuned via chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation, for dynamic prompt generation upon semantic drift; (iii) a hierarchical safety module enforcing kinematic constraints (e.g., speed, lane centering, stability); and (iv) a compact predictive world model to reward alignment with anticipated ideal states. DriveMind achieves 19.4 +/- 2.3 km/h average speed, 0.98 +/- 0.03 route completion, and near-zero collisions in CARLA Town 2, outperforming baselines by over 4% in success rate. Its semantic reward generalizes zero-shot to real dash-cam data with minimal distributional shift, demonstrating robust cross-domain alignment and potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper proposes a multimodal cognition and embodied decision-making brain system, ``Wenlu", designed to enable secure fusion of private knowledge and public models, unified processing of multimodal data such as images and speech, and closed-loop decision-making from cognition to automatic generation of hardware-level code. The system introduces a brain-inspired memory tagging and replay mechanism, seamlessly integrating user-private data, industry-specific knowledge, and general-purpose language models. It provides precise and efficient multimodal services for enterprise decision support, medical analysis, autonomous driving, robotic control, and more. Compared with existing solutions, ``Wenlu" demonstrates significant advantages in multimodal processing, privacy security, end-to-end hardware control code generation, self-learning, and sustainable updates, thus laying a solid foundation for constructing the next-generation intelligent core.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Using Diffusion Ensembles to Estimate Uncertainty for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00560v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end planning systems for autonomous driving are improving rapidly, especially in closed-loop simulation environments like CARLA. Many such driving systems either do not consider uncertainty as part of the plan itself, or obtain it by using specialized representations that do not generalize. In this paper, we propose EnDfuser, an end-to-end driving system that uses a diffusion model as the trajectory planner. EnDfuser effectively leverages complex perception information like fused camera and LiDAR features, through combining attention pooling and trajectory planning into a single diffusion transformer module. Instead of committing to a single plan, EnDfuser produces a distribution of candidate trajectories (128 for our case) from a single perception frame through ensemble diffusion. By observing the full set of candidate trajectories, EnDfuser provides interpretability for uncertain, multi-modal future trajectory spaces, where there are multiple plausible options. EnDfuser achieves a competitive driving score of 70.1 on the Longest6 benchmark in CARLA with minimal concessions on inference speed. Our findings suggest that ensemble diffusion, used as a drop-in replacement for traditional point-estimate trajectory planning modules, can help improve the safety of driving decisions by modeling the uncertainty of the posterior trajectory distribution.</p></details> |  | None |

However, scaling these models greatly increases computational overhead, complicating deployment in resource-constrained settings like robot manipulation and autonomous driving. To address this, we propose Saliency-Aware Quantized Imitation Learning (SQIL), which combines quantization-aware training with a selective loss-weighting strategy for mission-critical states. By identifying these states via saliency scores and emphasizing them in the training loss, SQIL preserves decision fidelity under low-bit precision. We validate SQIL's generalization capability across extensive simulation benchmarks with environment variations, real-world tasks, and cross-domain tasks (self-driving, physics simulation), consistently recovering full-precision performance. Notably, a 4-bit weight-quantized VLA model for robotic manipulation achieves up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings on an edge GPU with minimal accuracy loss. These results underline SQIL's potential for efficiently deploying large IL-based policy models on resource-limited devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.01034</p></details> | None |

These challenges include the difficulty in accommodating the multi-modal nature of trajectories, the limitations of single expert model in managing diverse scenarios, and insufficient consideration of environmental interactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces the EMoE-Planner, which incorporates three innovative approaches. Firstly, the Explicit MoE (Mixture of Experts) dynamically selects specialized experts based on scenario-specific information through a shared scene router. Secondly, the planner utilizes scene-specific queries to provide multi-modal priors, directing the model's focus towards relevant target areas. Lastly, it enhances the prediction model and loss calculation by considering the interactions between the ego vehicle and other agents, thereby significantly boosting planning performance. Comparative experiments were conducted on the Nuplan dataset against the state-of-the-art methods. The simulation results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms SOTA models across nearly all test scenarios. Our model is the first pure learning model to achieve performance surpassing rule-based algorithms in almost all Nuplan closed-loop simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text 10 pages with 7 figures</p></details> | None |

As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |

However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate agents with fully synthetic, single-turn queries, limited visual modalities, and lack a framework to assess reasoning quality over multiple steps as required in real-world settings. To address this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating vision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world, multimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual contexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional text. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual reasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports, and math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with explicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we propose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the correctness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness of tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the best-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to solve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success. These findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use capabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic reasoning models.

Existing voxel-based methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation apply uniform partition to the 3D LiDAR point cloud to form a structured representation based on cartesian/cylindrical coordinates. Although these methods show impressive performance, the drawback of existing voxel-based methods remains in two aspects: (1) it requires a large enough input voxel resolution, which brings a large amount of computation cost and memory consumption. (2) it does not well handle the unbalanced point distribution of LiDAR point cloud. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform cylindrical partition network named NUC-Net to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, we propose the Arithmetic Progression of Interval (API) method to non-uniformly partition the radial axis and generate the voxel representation which is representative and efficient. Moreover, we propose a non-uniform multi-scale aggregation method to improve contextual information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets with much faster speed and much less training time. And our method can be a general component for LiDAR semantic segmentation, which significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the uniform counterpart by $4 \times$ training faster and $2 \times$ GPU memory reduction and $3 \times$ inference speedup. We further provide theoretical analysis towards understanding why NUC is effective and how point distribution affects performance.

Rule-based planners are efficient but lack generalization, while learning-based planners excel in generalization yet have limitations in real-time performance and interpretability. In long-tail scenarios, these challenges make planning particularly difficult. To leverage the strengths of both rule-based and learning-based planners, we proposed the Scenario-Aware Hybrid Planner (SAH-Drive) for closed-loop vehicle trajectory planning. Inspired by human driving behavior, SAH-Drive combines a lightweight rule-based planner and a comprehensive learning-based planner, utilizing a dual-timescale decision neuron to determine the final trajectory. To enhance the computational efficiency and robustness of the hybrid planner, we also employed a diffusion proposal number regulator and a trajectory fusion module. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the generalization capability of the planning system, achieving state-of-the-art performance in interPlan, while maintaining computational efficiency without incurring substantial additional runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> | None |

The combination of these multi-modal data enhances environmental perception by providing 3D spatial context, which is absent in standard RGB images. Although RGBD multi-modal data can be available to train computer vision models, accessing all sensor modalities during the inference stage may be infeasible due to sensor failures or resource constraints, leading to a mismatch between data modalities available during training and inference. Traditional Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (CMKD) frameworks, developed to address this task, are typically based on a teacher/student paradigm, where a multi-modal teacher distills knowledge into a single-modality student model. However, these approaches face challenges in teacher architecture choices and distillation process selection, thus limiting their adoption in real-world scenarios. To overcome these issues, we introduce CroDiNo-KD (Cross-Modal Disentanglement: a New Outlook on Knowledge Distillation), a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework for RGBD semantic segmentation. Our approach simultaneously learns single-modality RGB and Depth models by exploiting disentanglement representation, contrastive learning and decoupled data augmentation with the aim to structure the internal manifolds of neural network models through interaction and collaboration. We evaluated CroDiNo-KD on three RGBD datasets across diverse domains, considering recent CMKD frameworks as competitors. Our findings illustrate the quality of CroDiNo-KD, and they suggest reconsidering the conventional teacher/student paradigm to distill information from multi-modal data to single-modality neural networks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, crafting effective reward functions remains challenging, as conventional approaches rely heavily on manual design and demonstrate limited efficacy in complex scenarios. To address this issue, this study introduces a responsibility-oriented reward function that explicitly incorporates traffic regulations into the RL framework. Specifically, we introduced a Traffic Regulation Knowledge Graph and leveraged Vision-Language Models alongside Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques to automate reward assignment. This integration guides agents to adhere strictly to traffic laws, thus minimizing rule violations and optimizing decision-making performance in diverse driving conditions. Experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly improves the accuracy of assigning accident responsibilities and effectively reduces the agent's liability in traffic incidents.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community.

Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 | None |

However, in certain scenarios, particularly in resource-constrained environments, some modalities available during training may be absent during inference. While existing frameworks effectively utilize multiple data sources during training and enable inference with reduced modalities, they are primarily designed for single-agent settings. This poses a critical limitation in dynamic environments such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), where incomplete data coverage can lead to decision-making blind spots. Conversely, some works explore multi-agent collaboration but without addressing missing modality at test time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Collaborative Auxiliary Modality Learning (CAML), a novel multi-modal multi-agent framework that enables agents to collaborate and share multi-modal data during training, while allowing inference with reduced modalities during testing. Experimental results in collaborative decision-making for CAV in accident-prone scenarios demonstrate that CAML achieves up to a ${\bf 58.1}\%$ improvement in accident detection. Additionally, we validate CAML on real-world aerial-ground robot data for collaborative semantic segmentation, achieving up to a ${\bf 10.6}\%$ improvement in mIoU.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Adaptive Conformal Guidance: A Framework for Multi-Domain Learning under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16736v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning domains. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose $\underline{Ada}$ptive $\underline{Con}$formal $\underline{G}$uidance (AdaConG), a universal, plug-and-play framework that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse domains and tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight AdaConG as a simple yet effective solution for multi-domain learning under uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Understanding The Calibration Benefits of Sharpness-Aware Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23866v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have been increasingly used in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. However, many studies suggest that they are prone to being poorly calibrated and have a propensity for overconfidence, which may have disastrous consequences. In this paper, unlike standard training such as stochastic gradient descent, we show that the recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) counteracts this tendency towards overconfidence. The theoretical analysis suggests that SAM allows us to learn models that are already well-calibrated by implicitly maximizing the entropy of the predictive distribution. Inspired by this finding, we further propose a variant of SAM, coined as CSAM, to ameliorate model calibration. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the benefits of SAM in reducing calibration error. Meanwhile, CSAM performs even better than SAM and consistently achieves lower calibration error than other approaches</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

To address this, we introduce Impromptu VLA. Our core contribution is the Impromptu VLA Dataset: over 80,000 meticulously curated video clips, distilled from over 2M source clips sourced from 8 open-source large-scale datasets. This dataset is built upon our novel taxonomy of four challenging unstructured categories and features rich, planning-oriented question-answering annotations and action trajectories. Crucially, experiments demonstrate that VLAs trained with our dataset achieve substantial performance gains on established benchmarks--improving closed-loop NeuroNCAP scores and collision rates, and reaching near state-of-the-art L2 accuracy in open-loop nuScenes trajectory prediction. Furthermore, our Q&A suite serves as an effective diagnostic, revealing clear VLM improvements in perception, prediction, and planning.

A significant limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios. We provide the video document and dataset, which are available at https://arma-traj.github.io/.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://arma-traj.github.io/) |

Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete distribution of points at different heights within one pillar with the information entropy guidance. This simple yet effective design greatly preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PillarHist in terms of both efficiency and performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in wireless multi-agent scenarios, limited bandwidth poses significant challenges to exchanging semantically rich multimodal information efficiently. Traditional semantic communication methods, though effective, struggle with redundancy and loss of crucial details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Semantic Communication (RAMSemCom) framework. RAMSemCom incorporates iterative, retrieval-driven semantic refinement tailored for distributed multi-agent environments, enabling efficient exchange of critical multimodal elements through local caching and selective transmission. Our approach dynamically optimizes retrieval using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to balance semantic fidelity with bandwidth constraints. A comprehensive case study on multi-agent autonomous driving demonstrates that our DRL-based retrieval strategy significantly improves task completion efficiency and reduces communication overhead compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these challenges, we propose CaSemCom, a context-aware SemCom framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM)-based gating mechanism and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to adaptively select and encode only high-impact semantic features across multiple data modalities. Our multimodal, multi-user case study demonstrates that CaSemCom significantly improves reconstructed image fidelity while reducing bandwidth usage, outperforming single-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods and traditional baselines in convergence speed, semantic accuracy, and retransmission overhead.</p></details> |  | None |

However, a lack of explainability in real-time decisions with contemporary learning methods impedes user trust and attenuates the widespread deployment and commercialization of such vehicles. Moreover, the issue is exacerbated when these vehicles are involved in or cause traffic accidents. Consequently, explainability in end-to-end autonomous driving is essential to build trust in vehicular automation. With that said, automotive researchers have not yet rigorously explored safety benefits and consequences of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving. This paper aims to bridge the gaps between these topics and seeks to answer the following research question: What are safety implications of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving? In this regard, we first revisit established safety and explainability concepts in end-to-end driving. Furthermore, we present critical case studies and show the pivotal role of explanations in enhancing driving safety. Finally, we describe insights from empirical studies and reveal potential value, limitations, and caveats of practical explainable AI methods with respect to their potential impacts on safety of end-to-end driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> | None |

To address these challenges, we introduce HMAD, a framework integrating a distinctive Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) based trajectory proposal mechanism with learned multi-criteria scoring. HMAD leverages BEVFormer and employs learnable anchored queries, initialized from a trajectory dictionary and refined via iterative offset decoding (inspired by DiffusionDrive), to produce numerous diverse and stable candidate trajectories. A key innovation, our simulation-supervised scorer module, then evaluates these proposals against critical metrics including no at-fault collisions, drivable area compliance, comfortableness, and overall driving quality (i.e., extended PDM score). Demonstrating its efficacy, HMAD achieves a 44.5% driving score on the CVPR 2025 private test set. This work highlights the benefits of effectively decoupling robust trajectory generation from comprehensive, safety-aware learned scoring for advanced autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our method for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 | None |

However, existing datasets are predominantly focused on structured urban environments, which limits the exploration of unstructured and specialized scenarios, particularly those characterized by significant dust levels. This paper introduces the LiDARDustX dataset, which is specifically designed for perception tasks under high-dust conditions, such as those encountered in mining areas. The LiDARDustX dataset consists of 30,000 LiDAR frames captured by six different LiDAR sensors, each accompanied by 3D bounding box annotations and point cloud semantic segmentation. Notably, over 80% of the dataset comprises dust-affected scenes. By utilizing this dataset, we have established a benchmark for evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art 3D detection and segmentation algorithms. Additionally, we have analyzed the impact of dust on perception accuracy and delved into the causes of these effects.

The objective is to learn optimal policies that maximize rewards while satisfying safety constraints modeled by constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs). Existing methods achieve sublinear regret under stochastic constraints but often fail in adversarial settings, where constraints are unknown, time-varying, and potentially adversarially designed. In this paper, we propose the Optimistic Mirror Descent Primal-Dual (OMDPD) algorithm, the first to address online CMDPs with anytime adversarial constraints. OMDPD achieves optimal regret O(sqrt(K)) and strong constraint violation O(sqrt(K)) without relying on Slater's condition or the existence of a strictly known safe policy. We further show that access to accurate estimates of rewards and transitions can further improve these bounds. Our results offer practical guarantees for safe decision-making in adversarial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 41 st International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> | None |

However, their integration into the daily routines of real-world classrooms remains limited. It is not yet common for a teacher to assign students individualized homework targeting their specific weaknesses, provide students with instant feedback, or simulate student responses to a new exam question. While these models excel in predictive performance, this lack of adoption can be attributed to a significant weakness: the lack of explainability of model decisions, leading to a lack of trust from students, parents, and teachers. This thesis aims to bring human needs to the forefront of eXplainable AI (XAI) research, grounded in the concrete use case of personalized learning and teaching. We frame the contributions along two verticals: technical advances in XAI and their aligned human studies. We investigate explainability in AI for education, revealing systematic disagreements between post-hoc explainers and identifying a need for inherently interpretable model architectures. We propose four novel technical contributions in interpretability with a multimodal modular architecture (MultiModN), an interpretable mixture-of-experts model (InterpretCC), adversarial training for explainer stability, and a theory-driven LLM-XAI framework to present explanations to students (iLLuMinaTE), which we evaluate in diverse settings with professors, teachers, learning scientists, and university students. By combining empirical evaluations of existing explainers with novel architectural designs and human studies, our work lays a foundation for human-centric AI systems that balance state-of-the-art performance with built-in transparency and trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, EPFL (Computer Science)</p></details> | None |

It allows real-time recognition and detection of vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles under varying environmental conditions. Among existing methods, 3D object detection in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) has emerged as the mainstream framework. To guarantee a safe, robust and trustworthy 3D object detection, 3D adversarial attacks are investigated, where attacks are placed in 3D environments to evaluate the model performance, e.g., putting a film on a car, clothing a pedestrian. The vulnerability of 3D object detection models to 3D adversarial attacks serves as an important indicator to evaluate the robustness of the model against perturbations. To investigate this vulnerability, we generate non-invasive 3D adversarial objects tailored for real-world attack scenarios. Our method verifies the existence of universal adversarial objects that are spatially consistent across time and camera views. Specifically, we employ differentiable rendering techniques to accurately model the spatial relationship between adversarial objects and the target vehicle. Furthermore, we introduce an occlusion-aware module to enhance visual consistency and realism under different viewpoints. To maintain attack effectiveness across multiple frames, we design a BEV spatial feature-guided optimization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reliably suppress vehicle predictions from state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, serving as an important tool to test robustness of 3D object detection models before deployment. Moreover, the generated adversarial objects exhibit strong generalization capabilities, retaining its effectiveness at various positions and distances in the scene.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods have not explored the most essential distribution patterns of voxels, resulting in unsatisfactory results. This paper first explores the inter-class distribution and geometric distribution of voxels, thereby solving the long-tail problem caused by the inter-class distribution and the poor performance caused by the geometric distribution. Specifically, this paper proposes SHTOcc (Sparse Head-Tail Occupancy), which uses sparse head-tail voxel construction to accurately identify and balance key voxels in the head and tail classes, while using decoupled learning to reduce the model's bias towards the dominant (head) category and enhance the focus on the tail class. Experiments show that significant improvements have been made on multiple baselines: SHTOcc reduces GPU memory usage by 42.2%, increases inference speed by 58.6%, and improves accuracy by about 7%, verifying its effectiveness and efficiency.

In autonomous driving, these capabilities help vehicles anticipate the behavior of other road users, perform risk-aware planning, accelerate training in simulation, and adapt to novel scenarios, thereby enhancing safety and reliability. Current approaches exhibit deficiencies in maintaining robust 3D geometric consistency or accumulating artifacts during occlusion handling, both critical for reliable safety assessment in autonomous navigation tasks. To address this, we introduce GeoDrive, which explicitly integrates robust 3D geometry conditions into driving world models to enhance spatial understanding and action controllability. Specifically, we first extract a 3D representation from the input frame and then obtain its 2D rendering based on the user-specified ego-car trajectory. To enable dynamic modeling, we propose a dynamic editing module during training to enhance the renderings by editing the positions of the vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models in both action accuracy and 3D spatial awareness, leading to more realistic, adaptable, and reliable scene modeling for safer autonomous driving. Additionally, our model can generalize to novel trajectories and offers interactive scene editing capabilities, such as object editing and object trajectory control.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code will be released at https://github.com/antonioo-c/GeoDrive</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/antonioo-c/GeoDrive) |

Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

The Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC) has emerged as the foremost evaluation metric for assessing the performance of SC systems. In this work, we present a formal statistical formulation of population AURC, presenting an equivalent expression that can be interpreted as a reweighted risk function. Through Monte Carlo methods, we derive empirical AURC plug-in estimators for finite sample scenarios. The weight estimators associated with these plug-in estimators are shown to be consistent, with low bias and tightly bounded mean squared error (MSE). The plug-in estimators are proven to converge at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\ln(n)/n})$ demonstrating statistical consistency. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our estimators through experiments across multiple datasets, model architectures, and confidence score functions (CSFs), demonstrating consistency and effectiveness in fine-tuning AURC performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing scenario generation and selection methods often lack adaptivity and semantic relevance, limiting their impact on performance improvement. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SERA}, an LLM-powered framework that enables autonomous driving systems to self-evolve by repairing failure cases through targeted scenario recommendation. By analyzing performance logs, SERA identifies failure patterns and dynamically retrieves semantically aligned scenarios from a structured bank. An LLM-based reflection mechanism further refines these recommendations to maximize relevance and diversity. The selected scenarios are used for few-shot fine-tuning, enabling targeted adaptation with minimal data. Experiments on the benchmark show that SERA consistently improves key metrics across multiple autonomous driving baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability under safety-critical conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

Direct time-of-flight (dToF) imaging offers high-precision, long-distance depth sensing, yet demands ultra-short pulse light sources and high-resolution time-to-digital converters. In contrast, indirect time-of-flight (iToF) imaging often suffers from phase wrapping and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the sensing distance increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel ToF imaging paradigm, termed Burst-Encodable Time-of-Flight (BE-ToF), which facilitates high-fidelity, long-distance depth imaging. Specifically, the BE-ToF system emits light pulses in burst mode and estimates the phase delay of the reflected signal over the entire burst period, thereby effectively avoiding the phase wrapping inherent to conventional iToF systems. Moreover, to address the low SNR caused by light attenuation over increasing distances, we propose an end-to-end learnable framework that jointly optimizes the coding functions and the depth reconstruction network. A specialized double well function and first-order difference term are incorporated into the framework to ensure the hardware implementability of the coding functions. The proposed approach is rigorously validated through comprehensive simulations and real-world prototype experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Existing methods predominantly adopt either attention-based flatten fusion or bird's eye view fusion through geometric transformations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited interpretability or dense computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce GaussianFusion, a Gaussian-based multi-sensor fusion framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our method employs intuitive and compact Gaussian representations as intermediate carriers to aggregate information from diverse sensors. Specifically, we initialize a set of 2D Gaussians uniformly across the driving scene, where each Gaussian is parameterized by physical attributes and equipped with explicit and implicit features. These Gaussians are progressively refined by integrating multi-modal features. The explicit features capture rich semantic and spatial information about the traffic scene, while the implicit features provide complementary cues beneficial for trajectory planning. To fully exploit rich spatial and semantic information in Gaussians, we design a cascade planning head that iteratively refines trajectory predictions through interactions with Gaussians. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed GaussianFusion framework.

An Ambiguous Optical Illusion Dataset exposing limitations of Explainable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21589v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From uncertainty quantification to real-world object detection, we recognize the importance of machine learning algorithms, particularly in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving or medical diagnostics. In machine learning, ambiguous data plays an important role in various machine learning domains. Optical illusions present a compelling area of study in this context, as they offer insight into the limitations of both human and machine perception. Despite this relevance, optical illusion datasets remain scarce. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset of optical illusions featuring intermingled animal pairs designed to evoke perceptual ambiguity. We identify generalizable visual concepts, particularly gaze direction and eye cues, as subtle yet impactful features that significantly influence model accuracy. By confronting models with perceptual ambiguity, our findings underscore the importance of concepts in visual learning and provide a foundation for studying bias and alignment between human and machine vision. To make this dataset useful for general purposes, we generate optical illusions systematically with different concepts discussed in our bias mitigation section. The dataset is accessible in Kaggle via https://kaggle.com/datasets/693bf7c6dd2cb45c8a863f9177350c8f9849a9508e9d50526e2ffcc5559a8333.

In this paper, we propose CogAD, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving model that emulates the hierarchical cognition mechanisms of human drivers. CogAD implements dual hierarchical mechanisms: global-to-local context processing for human-like perception and intent-conditioned multi-mode trajectory generation for cognitively-inspired planning. The proposed method demonstrates three principal advantages: comprehensive environmental understanding through hierarchical perception, robust planning exploration enabled by multi-level planning, and diverse yet reasonable multi-modal trajectory generation facilitated by dual-level uncertainty modeling. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Bench2Drive demonstrate that CogAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end planning, exhibiting particular superiority in long-tail scenarios and robust generalization to complex real-world driving conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Towards Human-Like Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Behavior-Centric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21565v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of vehicles is crucial for the development of autonomous driving (AD) systems, particularly in complex and dynamic traffic environments. In this study, we introduce HiT (Human-like Trajectory Prediction), a novel model designed to enhance trajectory prediction by incorporating behavior-aware modules and dynamic centrality measures. Unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving behaviors. This research presents a significant step forward in trajectory prediction, offering a more reliable and interpretable approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of fully autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

It is a critical component of efficient perception and decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention. However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence, there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding, and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aim-uofa.github.io/ACTIVE-o3</p></details> | [Code Link](https://aim-uofa.github.io/ACTIVE-o3) |

Existing real-time scheduling and response-time analysis techniques for ROS~2 focus on applications written in C++ and do not address the unique execution models and challenges presented by Rust's asynchronous programming paradigm. In this paper, we analyze the execution model of R2R -- an asynchronous Rust ROS~2 bindings and various asynchronous Rust runtimes, comparing them with the execution model of C++ ROS~2 applications. We propose a structured approach for R2R applications aimed at deterministic real-time operation involving thread prioritization and callback-to-thread mapping schemes. Our experimental evaluation based on measuring end-to-end latencies of a synthetic application shows that the proposed approach is effective and outperforms other evaluated configurations. A more complex autonomous driving case study demonstrates its practical applicability. Overall, the experimental results indicate that our proposed structure achieves bounded response times for time-critical tasks. This paves the way for future work to adapt existing or develop new response-time analysis techniques for R2R applications using our structure.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce SURDS, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). Built on the nuScenes dataset, SURDS comprises 41,080 vision-question-answer training instances and 9,250 evaluation samples, spanning six spatial categories: orientation, depth estimation, pixel-level localization, pairwise distance, lateral ordering, and front-behind relations. We benchmark leading general-purpose VLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen, revealing persistent limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding. To address these deficiencies, we go beyond static evaluation and explore whether alignment techniques can improve spatial reasoning performance. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment scheme leveraging spatially grounded reward signals - capturing both perception-level accuracy (location) and reasoning consistency (logic). We further incorporate final-answer correctness and output-format rewards to guide fine-grained policy adaptation. Our GRPO-aligned variant achieves an overall score of 40.80 in the SURDS benchmark. Notably, it outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o (13.30) and Gemini-2.0-flash (35.71). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based alignment can significantly and consistently enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in real-world driving contexts. We release the SURDS benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and GRPO alignment code through: https://github.com/XiandaGuo/Drive-MLLM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/XiandaGuo/Drive-MLLM) |
| **[Robust Video-Based Pothole Detection and Area Estimation for Intelligent Vehicles with Depth Map and Kalman Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21049v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road potholes pose a serious threat to driving safety and comfort, making their detection and assessment a critical task in fields such as autonomous driving. When driving vehicles, the operators usually avoid large potholes and approach smaller ones at reduced speeds to ensure safety. Therefore, accurately estimating pothole area is of vital importance. Most existing vision-based methods rely on distance priors to construct geometric models. However, their performance is susceptible to variations in camera angles and typically relies on the assumption of a flat road surface, potentially leading to significant errors in complex real-world environments. To address these problems, a robust pothole area estimation framework that integrates object detection and monocular depth estimation in a video stream is proposed in this paper. First, to enhance pothole feature extraction and improve the detection of small potholes, ACSH-YOLOv8 is proposed with ACmix module and the small object detection head. Then, the BoT-SORT algorithm is utilized for pothole tracking, while DepthAnything V2 generates depth maps for each frame. With the obtained depth maps and potholes labels, a novel Minimum Bounding Triangulated Pixel (MBTP) method is proposed for pothole area estimation. Finally, Kalman Filter based on Confidence and Distance (CDKF) is developed to maintain consistency of estimation results across consecutive frames. The results show that ACSH-YOLOv8 model achieves an AP(50) of 76.6%, representing a 7.6% improvement over YOLOv8. Through CDKF optimization across consecutive frames, pothole predictions become more robust, thereby enhancing the method's practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs remains largely underexplored. Besides, as outdoor driving scenarios frequently involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering formulation closely aligned with radar sensing physics, improving synthesis accuracy and interoperability. Extensive experiments on public radar datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RF4D in terms of radar measurement synthesis quality and occupancy estimation accuracy, achieving especially pronounced improvements in dynamic outdoor scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated through non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make the voxel representation aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Rather than focusing on improving feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, an innovative strategy-based hybrid framework HS-SLAM is proposed to integrate the advantages of direct and feature-based methods for fast computation without decreasing the performance. It first estimates the relative positions of consecutive frames using IMU pose estimation within the tracking thread. Then, it refines these estimates through a multi-layer direct method, which progressively corrects the relative pose from coarse to fine, ultimately achieving accurate corner-based feature matching. This approach serves as an alternative to the conventional constant-velocity tracking model. By selectively bypassing descriptor extraction for non-critical frames, HS-SLAM significantly improves the tracking speed. Experimental evaluations on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate that HS-SLAM achieves higher localization accuracies than ORB-SLAM3 while improving the average tracking efficiency by 15%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |

To address these challenges, we propose practical methods to enhance the performance of 3D detection and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) classification for unseen objects. The proposed methods include anomaly sample augmentation, learning of universal objectness, learning of detecting unseen objects, and learning of distinguishing unseen objects. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the KITTI Misc benchmark and two additional synthetic OOD benchmarks: the Nuscenes OOD benchmark and the SUN-RGBD OOD benchmark. The proposed methods consistently enhance performance by a large margin across all existing methods, giving insight for future work on unseen 3D object detection in the wild.</p></details> | Under review | None |

Currently, these profiles typically provide descriptive summaries, such as histograms, of single stress parameters like temperature, humidity, or voltage. This is highly aggregated information. New requirements for electric and autonomous driving cars require much more information how applications are used. In this work, we present a new approach for mission profiles which contains detailed usage information. We suggest a functional description over time, which allows joint modeling of various characteristics such as temperature, humidity, and voltage. The entire lifecycle history is covered, and the method can control the temporal resolution, i.e., the level of details of a mission profile. As a result, more accurate mission profiles can be generated, user quantiles can be derived, and usage outliers can be identified. This model establishes a framework to exchange usage data between suppliers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and end customers while data integrity and protection are assured.</p></details> |  | None |

However, conventional end-to-end models fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision, limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted driving conditions. Our analysis further highlights the impact of vision encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression. We will release the AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support future research.</p></details> |  | None |

Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, published to ACL</p></details> | None |

This radar-lidar localization leverages the benefits of both sensors; radar is resilient against adverse weather, while lidar produces high-quality maps in clear conditions. However, owing in part to the unique artefacts present in radar measurements, radar-lidar localization has struggled to achieve comparable performance to lidar-lidar systems, preventing it from being viable for autonomous driving. This work builds on ICP-based radar-lidar localization by including a learned preprocessing step that weights radar points based on high-level scan information. To train the weight-generating network, we present a novel, stand-alone, open-source differentiable ICP library. The learned weights facilitate ICP by filtering out harmful radar points related to artefacts, noise, and even vehicles on the road. Combining an analytical approach with a learned weight reduces overall localization errors and improves convergence in radar-lidar ICP results run on real-world autonomous driving data. Our code base is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves competitive performance with only 10% of voxel annotations, reaching a mIoU of 16.59% on the SemanticKITTI validation set.</p></details> |  | None |

However, generating realistic and controllable traffic scenarios in long-tail situations remains a significant challenge. Existing generative models suffer from the conflicting objective between user-defined controllability and realism constraints, which is amplified in safety-critical contexts. In this work, we introduce the Causal Compositional Diffusion Model (CCDiff), a structure-guided diffusion framework to address these challenges. We first formulate the learning of controllable and realistic closed-loop simulation as a constrained optimization problem. Then, CCDiff maximizes controllability while adhering to realism by automatically identifying and injecting causal structures directly into the diffusion process, providing structured guidance to enhance both realism and controllability. Through rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets and in a closed-loop simulator, CCDiff demonstrates substantial gains over state-of-the-art approaches in generating realistic and user-preferred trajectories. Our results show CCDiff's effectiveness in extracting and leveraging causal structures, showing improved closed-loop performance based on key metrics such as collision rate, off-road rate, FDE, and comfort.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge: cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
