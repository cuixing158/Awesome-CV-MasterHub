It is a critical component of efficient perception and decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention. However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence, there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding, and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aim-uofa.github.io/ACTIVE-o3</p></details> | [Code Link](https://aim-uofa.github.io/ACTIVE-o3) |

Existing real-time scheduling and response-time analysis techniques for ROS~2 focus on applications written in C++ and do not address the unique execution models and challenges presented by Rust's asynchronous programming paradigm. In this paper, we analyze the execution model of R2R -- an asynchronous Rust ROS~2 bindings and various asynchronous Rust runtimes, comparing them with the execution model of C++ ROS~2 applications. We propose a structured approach for R2R applications aimed at deterministic real-time operation involving thread prioritization and callback-to-thread mapping schemes. Our experimental evaluation based on measuring end-to-end latencies of a synthetic application shows that the proposed approach is effective and outperforms other evaluated configurations. A more complex autonomous driving case study demonstrates its practical applicability. Overall, the experimental results indicate that our proposed structure achieves bounded response times for time-critical tasks. This paves the way for future work to adapt existing or develop new response-time analysis techniques for R2R applications using our structure.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SURDS: Benchmarking Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Driving Scenarios with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13112v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatial reasoning in outdoor environments - covering geometry, object pose, and inter-object relationships - is fundamental to downstream tasks such as mapping, motion forecasting, and high-level planning in autonomous driving. We introduce SURDS, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). Built on the nuScenes dataset, SURDS comprises 41,080 vision-question-answer training instances and 9,250 evaluation samples, spanning six spatial categories: orientation, depth estimation, pixel-level localization, pairwise distance, lateral ordering, and front-behind relations. We benchmark leading general-purpose VLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen, revealing persistent limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding. To address these deficiencies, we go beyond static evaluation and explore whether alignment techniques can improve spatial reasoning performance. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment scheme leveraging spatially grounded reward signals - capturing both perception-level accuracy (location) and reasoning consistency (logic). We further incorporate final-answer correctness and output-format rewards to guide fine-grained policy adaptation. Our GRPO-aligned variant achieves an overall score of 40.80 in the SURDS benchmark. Notably, it outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o (13.30) and Gemini-2.0-flash (35.71). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based alignment can significantly and consistently enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in real-world driving contexts. We release the SURDS benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and GRPO alignment code through: https://github.com/XiandaGuo/Drive-MLLM.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/XiandaGuo/Drive-MLLM) |
| **[Robust Video-Based Pothole Detection and Area Estimation for Intelligent Vehicles with Depth Map and Kalman Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21049v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road potholes pose a serious threat to driving safety and comfort, making their detection and assessment a critical task in fields such as autonomous driving. When driving vehicles, the operators usually avoid large potholes and approach smaller ones at reduced speeds to ensure safety. Therefore, accurately estimating pothole area is of vital importance. Most existing vision-based methods rely on distance priors to construct geometric models. However, their performance is susceptible to variations in camera angles and typically relies on the assumption of a flat road surface, potentially leading to significant errors in complex real-world environments. To address these problems, a robust pothole area estimation framework that integrates object detection and monocular depth estimation in a video stream is proposed in this paper. First, to enhance pothole feature extraction and improve the detection of small potholes, ACSH-YOLOv8 is proposed with ACmix module and the small object detection head. Then, the BoT-SORT algorithm is utilized for pothole tracking, while DepthAnything V2 generates depth maps for each frame. With the obtained depth maps and potholes labels, a novel Minimum Bounding Triangulated Pixel (MBTP) method is proposed for pothole area estimation. Finally, Kalman Filter based on Confidence and Distance (CDKF) is developed to maintain consistency of estimation results across consecutive frames. The results show that ACSH-YOLOv8 model achieves an AP(50) of 76.6%, representing a 7.6% improvement over YOLOv8. Through CDKF optimization across consecutive frames, pothole predictions become more robust, thereby enhancing the method's practical applicability.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RF4D:Neural Radar Fields for Novel View Synthesis in Outdoor Dynamic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20967v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural fields (NFs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in scene reconstruction, powering various tasks such as novel view synthesis. However, existing NF methods relying on RGB or LiDAR inputs often exhibit severe fragility to adverse weather, particularly when applied in outdoor scenarios like autonomous driving. In contrast, millimeter-wave radar is inherently robust to environmental changes, while unfortunately, its integration with NFs remains largely underexplored. Besides, as outdoor driving scenarios frequently involve moving objects, making spatiotemporal modeling essential for temporally consistent novel view synthesis. To this end, we introduce RF4D, a radar-based neural field framework specifically designed for novel view synthesis in outdoor dynamic scenes. RF4D explicitly incorporates temporal information into its representation, significantly enhancing its capability to model moving objects. We further introduce a feature-level flow module that predicts latent temporal offsets between adjacent frames, enforcing temporal coherence in dynamic scene modeling. Moreover, we propose a radar-specific power rendering formulation closely aligned with radar sensing physics, improving synthesis accuracy and interoperability. Extensive experiments on public radar datasets demonstrate the superior performance of RF4D in terms of radar measurement synthesis quality and occupancy estimation accuracy, achieving especially pronounced improvements in dynamic outdoor scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DSOcc: Leveraging Depth Awareness and Semantic Aid to Boost Camera-Based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20951v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated through non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make the voxel representation aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Rather than focusing on improving feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HS-SLAM: A Fast and Hybrid Strategy-Based SLAM Approach for Low-Speed Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20906v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a key module of robotics and low-speed autonomous vehicles, which is usually limited by the high computation burden for practical applications. To this end, an innovative strategy-based hybrid framework HS-SLAM is proposed to integrate the advantages of direct and feature-based methods for fast computation without decreasing the performance. It first estimates the relative positions of consecutive frames using IMU pose estimation within the tracking thread. Then, it refines these estimates through a multi-layer direct method, which progressively corrects the relative pose from coarse to fine, ultimately achieving accurate corner-based feature matching. This approach serves as an alternative to the conventional constant-velocity tracking model. By selectively bypassing descriptor extraction for non-critical frames, HS-SLAM significantly improves the tracking speed. Experimental evaluations on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate that HS-SLAM achieves higher localization accuracies than ORB-SLAM3 while improving the average tracking efficiency by 15%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[UOD: Unseen Object Detection in 3D Point Cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03846v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 3D object detectors encounter extreme challenges in localizing unseen 3D objects and recognizing them as unseen, which is a crucial technology in autonomous driving in the wild. To address these challenges, we propose practical methods to enhance the performance of 3D detection and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) classification for unseen objects. The proposed methods include anomaly sample augmentation, learning of universal objectness, learning of detecting unseen objects, and learning of distinguishing unseen objects. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the KITTI Misc benchmark and two additional synthetic OOD benchmarks: the Nuscenes OOD benchmark and the SUN-RGBD OOD benchmark. The proposed methods consistently enhance performance by a large margin across all existing methods, giving insight for future work on unseen 3D object detection in the wild.</p></details> | Under review | None |
| **[A New View to Mission Profiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20792v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mission profiles cover the conditions that a component, e.g., an electronic component of a vehicle, is exposed to during its lifecycle. Currently, these profiles typically provide descriptive summaries, such as histograms, of single stress parameters like temperature, humidity, or voltage. This is highly aggregated information. New requirements for electric and autonomous driving cars require much more information how applications are used. In this work, we present a new approach for mission profiles which contains detailed usage information. We suggest a functional description over time, which allows joint modeling of various characteristics such as temperature, humidity, and voltage. The entire lifecycle history is covered, and the method can control the temporal resolution, i.e., the level of details of a mission profile. As a result, more accurate mission profiles can be generated, user quantiles can be derived, and usage outliers can be identified. This model establishes a framework to exchange usage data between suppliers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and end customers while data integrity and protection are assured.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DriveRX: A Vision-Language Reasoning Model for Cross-Task Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20665v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires real-time, robust reasoning across perception, prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision, limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted driving conditions. Our analysis further highlights the impact of vision encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression. We will release the AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support future research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhancing Transformation from Natural Language to Signal Temporal Logic Using LLMs with Diverse External Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20658v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Logic (TL), especially Signal Temporal Logic (STL), enables precise formal specification, making it widely used in cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving and robotics. Automatically transforming NL into STL is an attractive approach to overcome the limitations of manual transformation, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, due to the lack of datasets, automatic transformation currently faces significant challenges and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an NL-STL dataset named STL-Diversity-Enhanced (STL-DivEn), which comprises 16,000 samples enriched with diverse patterns. To develop the dataset, we first manually create a small-scale seed set of NL-STL pairs. Next, representative examples are identified through clustering and used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating additional NL-STL pairs. Finally, diversity and accuracy are ensured through rigorous rule-based filters and human validation. Furthermore, we introduce the Knowledge-Guided STL Transformation (KGST) framework, a novel approach for transforming natural language into STL, involving a generate-then-refine process based on external knowledge. Statistical analysis shows that the STL-DivEn dataset exhibits more diversity than the existing NL-STL dataset. Moreover, both metric-based and human evaluations indicate that our KGST approach outperforms baseline models in transformation accuracy on STL-DivEn and DeepSTL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, published to ACL</p></details> | None |
| **[Pointing the Way: Refining Radar-Lidar Localization Using Learned ICP Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08731v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel deep-learning-based approach to improve localizing radar measurements against lidar maps. This radar-lidar localization leverages the benefits of both sensors; radar is resilient against adverse weather, while lidar produces high-quality maps in clear conditions. However, owing in part to the unique artefacts present in radar measurements, radar-lidar localization has struggled to achieve comparable performance to lidar-lidar systems, preventing it from being viable for autonomous driving. This work builds on ICP-based radar-lidar localization by including a learned preprocessing step that weights radar points based on high-level scan information. To train the weight-generating network, we present a novel, stand-alone, open-source differentiable ICP library. The learned weights facilitate ICP by filtering out harmful radar points related to artefacts, noise, and even vehicles on the road. Combining an analytical approach with a learned weight reduces overall localization errors and improves convergence in radar-lidar ICP results run on real-world autonomous driving data. Our code base is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

| **[OccLE: Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20617v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an intuitive and efficient scene understanding and has attracted significant interest in autonomous driving perception. Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves competitive performance with only 10% of voxel annotations, reaching a mIoU of 16.59% on the SemanticKITTI validation set.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Causal Composition Diffusion Model for Closed-loop Traffic Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17920v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation is critical for safety evaluation in autonomous driving, particularly in capturing complex interactive behaviors. However, generating realistic and controllable traffic scenarios in long-tail situations remains a significant challenge. Existing generative models suffer from the conflicting objective between user-defined controllability and realism constraints, which is amplified in safety-critical contexts. In this work, we introduce the Causal Compositional Diffusion Model (CCDiff), a structure-guided diffusion framework to address these challenges. We first formulate the learning of controllable and realistic closed-loop simulation as a constrained optimization problem. Then, CCDiff maximizes controllability while adhering to realism by automatically identifying and injecting causal structures directly into the diffusion process, providing structured guidance to enhance both realism and controllability. Through rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets and in a closed-loop simulator, CCDiff demonstrates substantial gains over state-of-the-art approaches in generating realistic and user-preferred trajectories. Our results show CCDiff's effectiveness in extracting and leveraging causal structures, showing improved closed-loop performance based on key metrics such as collision rate, off-road rate, FDE, and comfort.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[WeatherEdit: Controllable Weather Editing with 4D Gaussian Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20471v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present WeatherEdit, a novel weather editing pipeline for generating realistic weather effects with controllable types and severity in 3D scenes. Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

| **[CCL-LGS: Contrastive Codebook Learning for 3D Language Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20469v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D reconstruction techniques and vision-language models have fueled significant progress in 3D semantic understanding, a capability critical to robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual/augmented reality. However, methods that rely on 2D priors are prone to a critical challenge: cross-view semantic inconsistencies induced by occlusion, image blur, and view-dependent variations. These inconsistencies, when propagated via projection supervision, deteriorate the quality of 3D Gaussian semantic fields and introduce artifacts in the rendered outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we propose CCL-LGS, a novel framework that enforces view-consistent semantic supervision by integrating multi-view semantic cues. Specifically, our approach first employs a zero-shot tracker to align a set of SAM-generated 2D masks and reliably identify their corresponding categories. Next, we utilize CLIP to extract robust semantic encodings across views. Finally, our Contrastive Codebook Learning (CCL) module distills discriminative semantic features by enforcing intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness. In contrast to previous methods that directly apply CLIP to imperfect masks, our framework explicitly resolves semantic conflicts while preserving category discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL-LGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

This extraction greatly impacts the overall performance of point-cloud-based odometry. This paper provides a first-of-its-kind, comprehensive comparison of 13 common radar point-cloud extractors for the task of iterative closest point based odometry in autonomous driving environments. Each extractor's parameters are tuned and tested on two FMCW radar datasets using approximately 176km of data from public roads. We find that the simplest, and fastest extractor, K-strongest, is the best overall extractor, consistently outperforming the average by 13.59% and 24.94% on each dataset, respectively. Additionally, we highlight the significance of tuning an extractor and the substantial improvement in odometry accuracy that it yields.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

It discusses the individual approaches from a "big picture" perspective and in context, but also discusses open issues and recent topics like the various roles of deep neural networks in this area, aiding in the discovery of human-interpretable knowledge. Further, we will present closed-loop scientific discovery systems, starting with the pioneering work on the Adam system up to current efforts in fields from material science to astronomy. Finally, we will elaborate on autonomy from a machine learning perspective, but also in analogy to the autonomy levels in autonomous driving. The maximal level, level five, is defined to require no human intervention at all in the production of scientific knowledge. Achieving this is one step towards solving the Nobel Turing Grand Challenge to develop AI Scientists: AI systems capable of making Nobel-quality scientific discoveries highly autonomously at a level comparable, and possibly superior, to the best human scientists by 2050.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages plus references</p></details> | None |
| **[Chain-of-Thought for Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20223v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of large language models in natural language processing has substantially elevated their semantic understanding and logical reasoning capabilities. Such proficiencies have been leveraged in autonomous driving systems, contributing to significant improvements in system performance. Models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, an advanced cognitive method that simulates human thinking processes, demonstrating remarkable reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. By structuring complex driving scenarios within a systematic reasoning framework, this approach has emerged as a prominent research focus in autonomous driving, substantially improving the system's ability to handle challenging cases. This paper investigates how CoT methods improve the reasoning abilities of autonomous driving models. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we present a systematic analysis of the motivations, methodologies, challenges, and future research directions of CoT in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we propose the insight of combining CoT with self-learning to facilitate self-evolution in driving systems. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of this study, we have compiled a dynamic repository of literature and open-source projects, diligently updated to incorporate forefront developments.

However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark.

| **[Uncertainty-Aware Safety-Critical Decision and Control for Autonomous Vehicles at Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19939v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in autonomous driving (AD) decision tasks. However, applying RL to urban AD, particularly in intersection scenarios, still faces significant challenges. The lack of safety constraints makes RL vulnerable to risks. Additionally, cognitive limitations and environmental randomness can lead to unreliable decisions in safety-critical scenarios. Therefore, it is essential to quantify confidence in RL decisions to improve safety. This paper proposes an Uncertainty-aware Safety-Critical Decision and Control (USDC) framework, which generates a risk-averse policy by constructing a risk-aware ensemble distributional RL, while estimating uncertainty to quantify the policy's reliability. Subsequently, a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) is employed as a safety filter to minimize intervention policy while dynamically enhancing constraints based on uncertainty. The ensemble critics evaluate both HOCBF and RL policies, embedding uncertainty to achieve dynamic switching between safe and flexible strategies, thereby balancing safety and efficiency. Simulation tests on unsignalized intersections in multiple tasks indicate that USDC can improve safety while maintaining traffic efficiency compared to baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | None |

To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[PillarHist: A Quantization-aware Pillar Feature Encoder based on Height-aware Histogram](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18734v4)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time and high-performance 3D object detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete distribution of points at different heights within one pillar with the information entropy guidance. This simple yet effective design greatly preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations.

While existing approaches have leveraged generative models for controllable image/video generation, they remain constrained to generating multi-view video sequences with fixed camera viewpoints and video frequency, significantly limiting their downstream applications. To address this, we present a generalizable camera simulation framework DriveCamSim, whose core innovation lies in the proposed Explicit Camera Modeling (ECM) mechanism. Instead of implicit interaction through vanilla attention, ECM establishes explicit pixel-wise correspondences across multi-view and multi-frame dimensions, decoupling the model from overfitting to the specific camera configurations (intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, number of views) and temporal sampling rates presented in the training data. For controllable generation, we identify the issue of information loss inherent in existing conditional encoding and injection pipelines, proposing an information-preserving control mechanism. This control mechanism not only improves conditional controllability, but also can be extended to be identity-aware to enhance temporal consistency in foreground object rendering. With above designs, our model demonstrates superior performance in both visual quality and controllability, as well as generalization capability across spatial-level (camera parameters variations) and temporal-level (video frame rate variations), enabling flexible user-customizable camera simulation tailored to diverse application scenarios. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim for facilitating future research.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/swc-17/DriveCamSim) |

Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has recently received considerable attention in AD due to its potential to enable efficient testing and validation but remains unexplored for radar point clouds. In this paper, we present NeuRadar, a NeRF-based model that jointly generates radar point clouds, camera images, and lidar point clouds. We explore set-based object detection methods such as DETR, and propose an encoder-based solution grounded in the NeRF geometry for improved generalizability. We propose both a deterministic and a probabilistic point cloud representation to accurately model the radar behavior, with the latter being able to capture radar's stochastic behavior. We achieve realistic reconstruction results for two automotive datasets, establishing a baseline for NeRF-based radar point cloud simulation models. In addition, we release radar data for ZOD's Sequences and Drives to enable further research in this field. To encourage further development of radar NeRFs, we release the source code for NeuRadar.</p></details> |  | None |

Multi-modality image fusion, particularly integrating infrared imaging, offers a robust solution by combining complementary information from different modalities to enhance scene understanding and decision-making. However, current methods face significant limitations: GAN-based approaches often produce blurry images that lack fine-grained details, while AE-based methods may introduce bias toward specific modalities, leading to unnatural fusion results. To address these challenges, we propose DAE-Fuse, a novel two-phase discriminative autoencoder framework that generates sharp and natural fused images. Furthermore, We pioneer the extension of image fusion techniques from static images to the video domain while preserving temporal consistency across frames, thus advancing the perceptual capabilities required for autonomous navigation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DAE-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, with superior generalizability to tasks like medical image fusion.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its performance is often degraded by Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) and multipath effects, especially in urban environments. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been driving innovation across numerous industries, introducing novel solutions to mitigate the challenges in satellite positioning. This paper presents a learning-filtering deep fusion framework for satellite positioning, termed LF-GNSS. The framework utilizes deep learning networks to intelligently analyze the signal characteristics of satellite observations, enabling the adaptive construction of observation noise covariance matrices and compensated innovation vectors for Kalman filter input. A dynamic hard example mining technique is incorporated to enhance model robustness by prioritizing challenging satellite signals during training. Additionally, we introduce a novel feature representation based on Dilution of Precision (DOP) contributions, which helps to more effectively characterize the signal quality of individual satellites and improve measurement weighting. LF-GNSS has been validated on both public and private datasets, demonstrating superior positioning accuracy compared to traditional methods and other learning-based solutions. To encourage further integration of AI and GNSS research, we will open-source the code at https://github.com/GarlanLou/LF-GNSS, and release a collection of satellite positioning datasets for urban scenarios at https://github.com/GarlanLou/LF-GNSS-Dataset.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/GarlanLou/LF-GNSS) |

However, the inherently multimodal nature of driving behaviors and the generalization challenges in long-tail scenarios remain critical obstacles to robust deployment. We propose DiffE2E, a diffusion-based end-to-end autonomous driving framework. This framework first performs multi-scale alignment of multi-sensor perception features through a hierarchical bidirectional cross-attention mechanism. It then introduces a novel class of hybrid diffusion-supervision decoders based on the Transformer architecture, and adopts a collaborative training paradigm that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both diffusion and supervised policy. DiffE2E models structured latent spaces, where diffusion captures the distribution of future trajectories and supervision enhances controllability and robustness. A global condition integration module enables deep fusion of perception features with high-level targets, significantly improving the quality of trajectory generation. Subsequently, a cross-attention mechanism facilitates efficient interaction between integrated features and hybrid latent variables, promoting the joint optimization of diffusion and supervision objectives for structured output generation, ultimately leading to more robust control. Experiments demonstrate that DiffE2E achieves state-of-the-art performance in both CARLA closed-loop evaluations and NAVSIM benchmarks. The proposed integrated diffusion-supervision policy offers a generalizable paradigm for hybrid action representation, with strong potential for extension to broader domains including embodied intelligence.

However, existing datasets and methods suffer from coarse-grained language instructions, and inadequate integration of 3D geometric reasoning with linguistic comprehension. To this end, we introduce NuGrounding, the first large-scale benchmark for multi-view 3D visual grounding in autonomous driving. We present a Hierarchy of Grounding (HoG) method to construct NuGrounding to generate hierarchical multi-level instructions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of human instruction patterns. To tackle this challenging dataset, we propose a novel paradigm that seamlessly combines instruction comprehension abilities of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) with precise localization abilities of specialist detection models. Our approach introduces two decoupled task tokens and a context query to aggregate 3D geometric information and semantic instructions, followed by a fusion decoder to refine spatial-semantic feature fusion for precise localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines adapted from representative 3D scene understanding methods by a significant margin and achieves 0.59 in precision and 0.64 in recall, with improvements of 50.8% and 54.7%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current research lacks sufficiently comprehensive open-world 3D perception benchmarks and robust generalizable methodologies. This paper introduces OpenAD, the first real open-world autonomous driving benchmark for 3D object detection. OpenAD is built upon a corner case discovery and annotation pipeline that integrates with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The proposed pipeline annotates corner case objects in a unified format for five autonomous driving perception datasets with 2000 scenarios. In addition, we devise evaluation methodologies and evaluate various open-world and specialized 2D and 3D models. Moreover, we propose a vision-centric 3D open-world object detection baseline and further introduce an ensemble method by fusing general and specialized models to address the issue of lower precision in existing open-world methods for the OpenAD benchmark.

Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output.

We present DriveX, a self-supervised world model that learns generalizable scene dynamics and holistic representations (geometric, semantic, and motion) from large-scale driving videos. DriveX introduces Omni Scene Modeling (OSM), a module that unifies multimodal supervision-3D point cloud forecasting, 2D semantic representation, and image generation-to capture comprehensive scene evolution. To simplify learning complex dynamics, we propose a decoupled latent world modeling strategy that separates world representation learning from future state decoding, augmented by dynamic-aware ray sampling to enhance motion modeling. For downstream adaptation, we design Future Spatial Attention (FSA), a unified paradigm that dynamically aggregates spatiotemporal features from DriveX's predictions to enhance task-specific inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate DriveX's effectiveness: it achieves significant improvements in 3D future point cloud prediction over prior work, while attaining state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks including occupancy prediction, flow estimation, and end-to-end driving. These results validate DriveX's capability as a general-purpose world model, paving the way for robust and unified autonomous driving frameworks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Echo Planning for Autonomous Driving: From Current Observations to Future Trajectories and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18945v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern end-to-end autonomous driving systems suffer from a critical limitation: their planners lack mechanisms to enforce temporal consistency between predicted trajectories and evolving scene dynamics. This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2 error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners. Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures | None |

This requirement is aligned well with the capabilities of world models, which understand the environment and predict the future. However, recent world models in autonomous driving are built explicitly, where they could predict the future by controllable driving video generation. We argue that driving world models should have two additional abilities: action control and action prediction. Following this line, previous methods are limited because they predict the video requires given actions of the same length as the video and ignore the dynamical action laws. To address these issues, we propose ProphetDWM, a novel end-to-end driving world model that jointly predicts future videos and actions. Our world model has an action module to learn latent action from the present to the future period by giving the action sequence and observations. And a diffusion-model-based transition module to learn the state distribution. The model is jointly trained by learning latent actions given finite states and predicting action and video. The joint learning connects the action dynamics and states and enables long-term future prediction. We evaluate our method in video generation and action prediction tasks on the Nuscenes dataset. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the best video consistency and best action prediction accuracy, while also enabling high-quality long-term video and action generation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures | None |

How to effectively evaluate the safety as well as the reliability of perception algorithms is becoming an emerging issue. Despite its critical importance, existing perception methods exhibit a limitation in their robustness, primarily due to the use of benchmarks are entierly simulated, which fail to align predicted results with actual outcomes, particularly under extreme weather conditions and sensor anomalies that are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, in this study, we propose a Sim-to-Real Evaluation Benchmark for Autonomous Driving (S2R-Bench). We collect diverse sensor anomaly data under various road conditions to evaluate the robustness of autonomous driving perception methods in a comprehensive and realistic manner. This is the first corruption robustness benchmark based on real-world scenarios, encompassing various road conditions, weather conditions, lighting intensities, and time periods. By comparing real-world data with simulated data, we demonstrate the reliability and practical significance of the collected data for real-world applications.

However, most available datasets predominantly consist of normal driving behaviors demonstrated by human drivers, resulting in a limited number of safety-critical cases. This imbalance, often referred to as a long-tail distribution, restricts the ability of driving algorithms to learn from crucial scenarios involving risk or failure, scenarios that are essential for humans to develop driving skills efficiently. To generate such scenarios, we utilize Multi-modal Large Language Models to convert crash reports of accidents into a structured scenario format, which can be directly executed within simulations. Specifically, we introduce CrashAgent, a multi-agent framework designed to interpret multi-modal real-world traffic crash reports for the generation of both road layouts and the behaviors of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic participants. We comprehensively evaluate the generated crash scenarios from multiple perspectives, including the accuracy of layout reconstruction, collision rate, and diversity. The resulting high-quality and large-scale crash dataset will be publicly available to support the development of safe driving algorithms in handling safety-critical situations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their communication has often not been human-understandable. Using natural language as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocol offers the potential for autonomous vehicles to drive cooperatively not only with each other but also with human drivers. In this work, we propose a suite of traffic tasks in autonomous driving where vehicles in a traffic scenario need to communicate in natural language to facilitate coordination in order to avoid an imminent collision and/or support efficient traffic flow. To this end, this paper introduces a novel method, LLM+Debrief, to learn a message generation and high-level decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles through multi-agent discussion. To evaluate LLM agents for driving, we developed a gym-like simulation environment that contains a range of driving scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLM+Debrief is more effective at generating meaningful and human-understandable natural language messages to facilitate cooperation and coordination than a zero-shot LLM agent.

However, their computational complexity and large memory footprint make them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, such as in-car cameras used for image collection and real-time processing. To address this challenge, we propose Clip4Retrofit, an efficient model distillation framework that enables real-time image labeling on edge devices. The framework is deployed on the Retrofit camera, a cost-effective edge device retrofitted into thousands of vehicles, despite strict limitations on compute performance and memory. Our approach distills the knowledge of the CLIP model into a lightweight student model, combining EfficientNet-B3 with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection heads to preserve cross-modal alignment while significantly reducing computational requirements. We demonstrate that our distilled model achieves a balance between efficiency and performance, making it ideal for deployment in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that Clip4Retrofit can perform real-time image labeling and object identification on edge devices with limited resources, offering a practical solution for applications such as autonomous driving and retrofitting existing systems. This work bridges the gap between state-of-the-art vision-language models and their deployment in resource-constrained environments, paving the way for broader adoption of foundation models in edge computing.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in CP, ego CAV needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it easy to be attacked by malicious agents. For example, a malicious agent can send harmful information to the ego CAV to mislead it. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel method, CP-Guard, a tailored defense mechanism for CP that can be deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against the ego CAV's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define a collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) to capture the discrepancy between the ego CAV and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in collaborative bird's eye view (BEV) tasks and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CP-Guard.

Explainability is vital for trust calibration, but explainable reinforcement learning for MAS faces challenges in state/action space complexity, stakeholder needs, and evaluation. Using the counterfactual theory of causation and LLMs' summarisation capabilities, we propose Agentic eXplanations via Interrogative Simulation (AXIS). AXIS generates intelligible causal explanations for pre-trained multi-agent policies by having an LLM interrogate an environment simulator using queries like 'whatif' and 'remove' to observe and synthesise counterfactual information over multiple rounds. We evaluate AXIS on autonomous driving across 10 scenarios for 5 LLMs with a novel evaluation methodology combining subjective preference, correctness, and goal/action prediction metrics, and an external LLM as evaluator. Compared to baselines, AXIS improves perceived explanation correctness by at least 7.7% across all models and goal prediction accuracy by 23% for 4 models, with improved or comparable action prediction accuracy, achieving the highest scores overall.</p></details> |  | None |

However, its performance heavily relies on the accuracy of lane detection, particularly at connected lane endpoints. Existing methods often suffer from lane endpoints deviation, leading to incorrect topology construction. To address this issue, we propose TopoPoint, a novel framework that explicitly detects lane endpoints and jointly reasons over endpoints and lanes for robust topology reasoning. During training, we independently initialize point and lane query, and proposed Point-Lane Merge Self-Attention to enhance global context sharing through incorporating geometric distances between points and lanes as an attention mask . We further design Point-Lane Graph Convolutional Network to enable mutual feature aggregation between point and lane query.

Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have emerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering enhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing BEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based representation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding boxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial oriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being affected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from this domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D regression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box encapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of these two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem into a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object detection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object detection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance problem. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified radar fusion backbone that eliminates the need for voxel grouping and processes the BEV-mapped point cloud with standard 2D convolutions, rather than sparse convolutions. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that RQR3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera-radar 3D object detection, outperforming the previous best method by +4% in NDS and +2.4% in mAP, and significantly reducing the translation and orientation errors, which are crucial for safe autonomous driving. These consistent gains highlight the robustness, precision, and real-world readiness of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing methods generate safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems (E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage, controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity. Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories. Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules.

However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate reward functions that reflect human implicit knowledge. We study this in three challenging settings -- autonomous driving, humanoid locomotion, and dexterous manipulation -- wherein notions of ``good" behavior are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, a truly evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in RL. REvolve generates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. Experimentally, we demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2025.

This limitation significantly hinders the assessment of more complex reasoning capabilities in RES models. We introduce WildRES, a novel benchmark that incorporates long queries with diverse attributes and non-distinctive queries for multiple targets. This benchmark spans diverse application domains, including autonomous driving environments and robotic manipulation scenarios, thus enabling more rigorous evaluation of complex reasoning capabilities in real-world settings. Our analysis reveals that current RES models demonstrate substantial performance deterioration when evaluated on WildRES. To address this challenge, we introduce SynRES, an automated pipeline generating densely paired compositional synthetic training data through three innovations: (1) a dense caption-driven synthesis for attribute-rich image-mask-expression triplets, (2) reliable semantic alignment mechanisms rectifying caption-pseudo mask inconsistencies via Image-Text Aligned Grouping, and (3) domain-aware augmentations incorporating mosaic composition and superclass replacement to emphasize generalization ability and distinguishing attributes over object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SynRES achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving gIoU by 2.0% on WildRES-ID and 3.8% on WildRES-DS.

However, existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states: where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Sensor fusion techniques that combine multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras have proven effective, but the integration of multiple devices increases both hardware complexity and cost. Therefore, developing a single sensor capable of performing multiple roles is highly desirable for cost-efficient and scalable autonomous driving systems. Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution due to their unique characteristics, including high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal resolution. These features enable them to perform well in challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light or backlit environments. Moreover, their ability to detect fine-grained motion events makes them suitable for applications like pedestrian detection and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication via visible light. In this study, we present a method for distance estimation using a monocular event camera and a roadside LED bar. By applying a phase-only correlation technique to the event data, we achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting the spatial shift between two light sources. This enables accurate triangulation-based distance estimation without requiring stereo vision. Field experiments conducted in outdoor driving scenarios demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves over 90% success rate with less than 0.5-meter error for distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters. Future work includes extending this method to full position estimation by leveraging infrastructure such as smart poles equipped with LEDs, enabling event-camera-based vehicles to determine their own position in real time. This advancement could significantly enhance navigation accuracy, route optimization, and integration into intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  | None |

Real-time anticipation is crucial for safe autonomous driving, yet most methods rely on computationally heavy modules like optical flow and intermediate feature extractors, making real-world deployment challenging. In this paper, we thus introduce RARE (Real-time Accident anticipation with Reused Embeddings), a lightweight framework that capitalizes on intermediate features from a single pre-trained object detector. By eliminating additional feature-extraction pipelines, RARE significantly reduces latency. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Attention Score Ranking Loss, which prioritizes higher attention on accident-related objects over non-relevant ones. This loss enhances both accuracy and interpretability. RARE demonstrates a 4-8 times speedup over existing approaches on the DAD and CCD benchmarks, achieving a latency of 13.6ms per frame (73.3 FPS) on an RTX 6000. Moreover, despite its reduced complexity, it attains state-of-the-art Average Precision and reliably anticipates imminent collisions in real time. These results highlight RARE's potential for safety-critical applications where timely and explainable anticipation is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[How Secure Are Large Language Models (LLMs) for Navigation in Urban Environments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09546v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics and automation, navigation systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance. However, the security aspects of these systems have received relatively less attention. This paper pioneers the exploration of vulnerabilities in LLM-based navigation models in urban outdoor environments, a critical area given the widespread application of this technology in autonomous driving, logistics, and emergency services. Specifically, we introduce a novel Navigational Prompt Attack that manipulates LLM-based navigation models by perturbing the original navigational prompt, leading to incorrect actions. Based on the method of perturbation, our attacks are divided into two types: Navigational Prompt Insert (NPI) Attack and Navigational Prompt Swap (NPS) Attack. We conducted comprehensive experiments on an LLM-based navigation model that employs various LLMs for reasoning. Our results, derived from the Touchdown and Map2Seq street-view datasets under both few-shot learning and fine-tuning configurations, demonstrate notable performance declines across seven metrics in the face of both white-box and black-box attacks. Moreover, our attacks can be easily extended to other LLM-based navigation models with similarly effective results. These findings highlight the generalizability and transferability of the proposed attack, emphasizing the need for enhanced security in LLM-based navigation systems. As an initial countermeasure, we propose the Navigational Prompt Engineering (NPE) Defense strategy, which concentrates on navigation-relevant keywords to reduce the impact of adversarial attacks. While initial findings indicate that this strategy enhances navigational safety, there remains a critical need for the wider research community to develop stronger defense methods to effectively tackle the real-world challenges faced by these systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing surround-view perception systems are limited by inefficiencies in unidirectional interaction pattern with human and distortions in overlapping regions exponentially propagating into non-overlapping areas. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatStitch, a surround-view human-machine co-perception system capable of unveiling obscured blind spot information through natural language commands integrated with external digital assets. To dismantle the unidirectional interaction bottleneck, ChatStitch implements a cognitively grounded closed-loop interaction multi-agent framework based on Large Language Models. To suppress distortion propagation across overlapping boundaries, ChatStitch proposes SV-UDIS, a surround-view unsupervised deep image stitching method under the non-global-overlapping condition. We conducted extensive experiments on the UDIS-D, MCOV-SLAM open datasets, and our real-world dataset. Specifically, our SV-UDIS method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UDIS-D dataset for 3, 4, and 5 image stitching tasks, with PSNR improvements of 9\%, 17\%, and 21\%, and SSIM improvements of 8\%, 18\%, and 26\%, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-supervised Multi-future Occupancy Forecasting for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21126v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environment prediction frameworks are critical for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dynamic settings. LiDAR-generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's-eye view for the scene representation, enabling self-supervised joint scene predictions while exhibiting resilience to partial observability and perception detection failures. Prior approaches have focused on deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures within the grid cell space. While these methods have seen some success, they frequently produce unrealistic predictions and fail to capture the stochastic nature of the environment. Additionally, they do not effectively integrate additional sensor modalities present in AVs. Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction (LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a generative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and planned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder, which provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based batch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal consistency issues and reduce compression losses. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets show that all variants of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperform prior approaches.</p></details> |  | None |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing rule-based and data-driven planners lack adaptability to long-tail scenarios, while knowledge-driven methods offer strong reasoning but face challenges in representation, control, and real-world evaluation. To address these challenges, we present LiloDriver, a lifelong learning framework for closed-loop motion planning in long-tail autonomous driving scenarios. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with a memory-augmented planner generation system, LiloDriver continuously adapts to new scenarios without retraining. It features a four-stage architecture including perception, scene encoding, memory-based strategy refinement, and LLM-guided reasoning. Evaluated on the nuPlan benchmark, LiloDriver achieves superior performance in both common and rare driving scenarios, outperforming static rule-based and learning-based planners. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining structured memory and LLM reasoning to enable scalable, human-like motion planning in real-world autonomous driving.

While prior research has primarily focused on unimodal image data, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, requiring the integration of multiple modalities for improved OOD detection. A key challenge is the lack of supervision signals from unknown data, leading to overconfident predictions on OOD samples. To address this challenge, we propose Feature Mixing, an extremely simple and fast method for multimodal outlier synthesis with theoretical support, which can be further optimized to help the model better distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. Feature Mixing is modality-agnostic and applicable to various modality combinations. Additionally, we introduce CARLA-OOD, a novel multimodal dataset for OOD segmentation, featuring synthetic OOD objects across diverse scenes and weather conditions. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, CARLA-OOD datasets, and the MultiOOD benchmark demonstrate that Feature Mixing achieves state-of-the-art performance with a $10 \times$ to $370 \times$ speedup.

To better utilize the spatial information inherent in 4D radar data, recent deep learning methods have transitioned from using sparse point cloud to 4D radar tensors. However, the scarcity of publicly available 4D radar tensor datasets limits model generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Previous methods addressed this by synthesizing radar data, but the outputs did not fully exploit the spatial information characteristic of 4D radar. To overcome these limitations, we propose LiDAR-to-4D radar data synthesis (L2RDaS), a framework that synthesizes spatially informative 4D radar tensors from LiDAR data available in existing autonomous driving datasets. L2RDaS integrates a modified U-Net architecture to effectively capture spatial information and an object information supplement (OBIS) module to enhance reflection fidelity. This framework enables the synthesis of radar tensors across diverse driving scenarios without additional sensor deployment or data collection. L2RDaS improves model generalization by expanding real datasets with synthetic radar tensors, achieving an average increase of 4.25\% in ${{AP}_{BEV}}$ and 2.87\% in ${{AP}_{3D}}$ across three detection models. Additionally, L2RDaS supports ground-truth augmentation (GT-Aug) by embedding annotated objects into LiDAR data and synthesizing them into radar tensors, resulting in further average increases of 3.75\% in ${{AP}_{BEV}}$ and 4.03\% in ${{AP}_{3D}}$.

VirT&R leverages aerial imagery captured for a target environment to train a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model so that dense point clouds and photo-textured meshes can be extracted. The NeRF mesh is used to create a high-fidelity simulation of the environment for piloting an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to virtually define a desired path. The mission can then be executed in the actual target environment by using NeRF-derived point cloud submaps associated along the path and an existing LiDAR Teach and Repeat (LT&R) framework. We benchmark the repeatability of VirT&R on over 12 km of autonomous driving data using physical markings that allow a sim-to-real lateral path-tracking error to be obtained and compared with LT&R. VirT&R achieved measured root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 19.5 cm and 18.4 cm in two different environments, which are slightly less than one tire width (24 cm) on the robot used for testing, and respective maximum errors were 39.4 cm and 47.6 cm. This was done using only the NeRF-derived teach map, demonstrating that VirT&R has similar closed-loop path-tracking performance to LT&R but does not require a human to manually teach the path to the UGV in the actual environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints, enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality. Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training.

In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models to generate Answer Set Programming rules by translating informal navigation instructions into structured, logic-based reasoning. ASP provides non-monotonic reasoning, allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to evolving scenarios without relying on predefined maps. We present an experimental evaluation in which LLMs generate ASP constraints that encode real-world urban driving logic into a formal knowledge representation. By automating the translation of informal navigation instructions into logical rules, our method improves adaptability and explainability in autonomous navigation. Results show that LLM-driven ASP rule generation supports semantic-based decision-making, offering an explainable framework for dynamic navigation planning that aligns closely with how humans communicate navigational intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, submitted for IEEE conference</p></details> | None |

However, applying RL to end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods including safe RL often fail to capture the true semantic meaning of "safety" in complex driving contexts, leading to either overly conservative driving behavior or constraint violations. To address these challenges, we propose VL-SAFE, a world model-based safe RL framework with Vision-Language model (VLM)-as-safety-guidance paradigm, designed for offline safe policy learning. Specifically, we construct offline datasets containing data collected by expert agents and labeled with safety scores derived from VLMs. A world model is trained to generate imagined rollouts together with safety estimations, allowing the agent to perform safe planning without interacting with the real environment. Based on these imagined trajectories and safety evaluations, actor-critic learning is conducted under VLM-based safety guidance to optimize the driving policy more safely and efficiently. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VL-SAFE achieves superior sample efficiency, generalization, safety, and overall performance compared to existing baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces a VLM-guided world model-based approach for safe autonomous driving.

Recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition, where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors.

In contrast to previous approaches that employ neural rendering with explicit depth supervision, VisionPAD utilizes more efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct multi-view representations using only images as supervision. Specifically, we introduce a self-supervised method for voxel velocity estimation. By warping voxels to adjacent frames and supervising the rendered outputs, the model effectively learns motion cues in the sequential data. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-frame photometric consistency approach to enhance geometric perception. It projects adjacent frames to the current frame based on rendered depths and relative poses, boosting the 3D geometric representation through pure image supervision. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that VisionPAD significantly improves performance in 3D object detection, occupancy prediction and map segmentation, surpassing state-of-the-art pre-training strategies by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[BadDepth: Backdoor Attacks Against Monocular Depth Estimation in the Physical World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16154v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep learning-based Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models have been widely applied in fields such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To fill the gap in this area, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of backdoor attacks against MDE models. Typically, existing backdoor attack methods can not be applied to MDE models. This is because the label used in MDE is in the form of a depth map. To address this, we propose BadDepth, the first backdoor attack targeting MDE models. BadDepth overcomes this limitation by selectively manipulating the target object's depth using an image segmentation model and restoring the surrounding areas via depth completion, thereby generating poisoned datasets for object-level backdoor attacks. To improve robustness in physical world scenarios, we further introduce digital-to-physical augmentation to adapt to the domain gap between the physical world and the digital domain. Extensive experiments on multiple models validate the effectiveness of BadDepth in both the digital domain and the physical world, without being affected by environmental factors.</p></details> |  | None |

Yet, existing models trained on real-world datasets, which naturally exhibit long-tail distributions, tend to underperform on rare and safety-critical, vulnerable classes, such as pedestrians and cyclists. Existing studies on reweighting and resampling techniques struggle with the scarcity and limited diversity within tail classes. To address these limitations, we introduce LTDA-Drive, a novel LLM-guided data augmentation framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-quality long-tail samples. LTDA-Drive replaces head-class objects in driving scenes with tail-class objects through a three-stage process: (1) text-guided diffusion models remove head-class objects, (2) generative models insert instances of the tail classes, and (3) an LLM agent filters out low-quality synthesized images. Experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that LTDA-Drive significantly improves tail-class detection, achieving 34.75\% improvement for rare classes over counterpart methods. These results further highlight the effectiveness of LTDA-Drive in tackling long-tail challenges by generating high-quality and diverse data.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Novel Benchmark and Dataset for Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting with Gaussian Point Cloud Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18197v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, immersive media and autonomous driving applications have significantly advanced through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which offers high-fidelity rendering and computational efficiency. Despite these advantages, 3DGS as a display-oriented representation requires substantial storage due to its numerous Gaussian attributes. Current compression methods have shown promising results but typically neglect the compression of Gaussian spatial positions, creating unnecessary bitstream overhead. We conceptualize Gaussian primitives as point clouds and propose leveraging point cloud compression techniques for more effective storage. AI-based point cloud compression demonstrates superior performance and faster inference compared to MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC). However, direct application of existing models to Gaussian compression may yield suboptimal results, as Gaussian point clouds tend to exhibit globally sparse yet locally dense geometric distributions that differ from conventional point cloud characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce GausPcgc for Gaussian point cloud geometry compression along with a specialized training dataset GausPcc-1K. Our work pioneers the integration of AI-based point cloud compression into Gaussian compression pipelines, achieving superior compression ratios. The framework complements existing Gaussian compression methods while delivering significant performance improvements. All code, data, and pre-trained models will be publicly released to facilitate further research advances in this field.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures | None |

Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs. By encouraging alignment in latent space, \textsc{VERDI} enables the modular AD stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high inference speed.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, efforts to generate adversarial driving scenarios often operate on abstract trajectory or BEV representations, falling short of delivering realistic sensor data that can truly stress-test autonomous driving (AD) systems. In this work, we introduce Challenger, a framework that produces physically plausible yet photorealistic adversarial driving videos. Generating such videos poses a fundamental challenge: it requires jointly optimizing over the space of traffic interactions and high-fidelity sensor observations. Challenger makes this affordable through two techniques: (1) a physics-aware multi-round trajectory refinement process that narrows down candidate adversarial maneuvers, and (2) a tailored trajectory scoring function that encourages realistic yet adversarial behavior while maintaining compatibility with downstream video synthesis. As tested on the nuScenes dataset, Challenger generates a diverse range of aggressive driving scenarios-including cut-ins, sudden lane changes, tailgating, and blind spot intrusions-and renders them into multiview photorealistic videos. Extensive evaluations show that these scenarios significantly increase the collision rate of state-of-the-art end-to-end AD models (UniAD, VAD, SparseDrive, and DiffusionDrive), and importantly, adversarial behaviors discovered for one model often transfer to others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pixtella.github.io/Challenger/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://pixtella.github.io/Challenger) |

However, current LLM-Dominated RL methods over-rely on LLM outputs, which are prone to hallucinations.Evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM indicates a non-hallucination rate of only approximately 57.95% when assessed on essential driving-related tasks. Thus, in these methods, hallucinations from the LLM can directly jeopardize the performance of driving policies. This paper argues that maintaining relative independence between the LLM and the RL is vital for solving the hallucinations problem. Consequently, this paper is devoted to propose a novel LLM-Hinted RL paradigm. The LLM is used to generate semantic hints for state augmentation and policy optimization to assist RL agent in motion planning, while the RL agent counteracts potential erroneous semantic indications through policy learning to achieve excellent driving performance. Based on this paradigm, we propose the HCRMP (LLM-Hinted Contextual Reinforcement Learning Motion Planner) architecture, which is designed that includes Augmented Semantic Representation Module to extend state space. Contextual Stability Anchor Module enhances the reliability of multi-critic weight hints by utilizing information from the knowledge base. Semantic Cache Module is employed to seamlessly integrate LLM low-frequency guidance with RL high-frequency control. Extensive experiments in CARLA validate HCRMP's strong overall driving performance. HCRMP achieves a task success rate of up to 80.3% under diverse driving conditions with different traffic densities. Under safety-critical driving conditions, HCRMP significantly reduces the collision rate by 11.4%, which effectively improves the driving performance in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing approaches predict future motion states with the extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight architecture.</p></details> | In submission | None |

However, linear models' expressive power and bias for real-world trajectories have not been thoroughly analyzed. We present an in-depth empirical analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and fit error in modelling object trajectories. We analyze vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian trajectories. Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity. This suggests the feasibility of using linear trajectory models in future motion prediction systems with inherent mathematical advantages.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TinyDrive: Multiscale Visual Question Answering with Selective Token Routing for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15564v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) employed for visual question-answering (VQA) in autonomous driving often require substantial computational resources that pose a challenge for their deployment in resource-constrained vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce TinyDrive, a lightweight yet effective VLM for multi-view VQA in driving scenarios. Our model comprises two key components including a multiscale vision encoder and a dual-level prioritization mechanism for tokens and sequences. The multiscale encoder facilitates the processing of multi-view images at diverse resolutions through scale injection and cross-scale gating to generate enhanced visual representations. At the token level, we design a token routing mechanism that dynamically selects and process the most informative tokens based on learned importance scores. At the sequence level, we propose integrating normalized loss, uncertainty estimates, and a diversity metric to formulate sequence scores that rank and preserve samples within a sequence priority buffer. Samples with higher scores are more frequently selected for training. TinyDrive is first evaluated on our custom-curated VQA dataset, and it is subsequently tested on the public DriveLM benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art language understanding performance. Notably, it achieves relative improvements of 11.1% and 35.4% in BLEU-4 and METEOR scores, respectively, despite having a significantly smaller parameter count.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a novel multi-view projection framework that excels in both domain generalization (DG) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our approach first aligns Lidar scans into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to create a large-scale synthetic 2D dataset (PC2D). We then use it to train a 2D segmentation model in-domain. During inference, the model processes hundreds of views per scene; the resulting logits are back-projected to 3D with an occlusion-aware voting scheme to generate final point-wise labels. Our framework is modular and enables extensive exploration of key design parameters, such as view generation optimization (VGO), visualization modality optimization (MODO), and 2D model choice. We evaluate on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets under both the DG and UDA settings. We achieve state-of-the-art results in UDA and close to state-of-the-art in DG, with particularly large gains on large, static classes.

Current state-of-the-art solutions primarily encode image features from each camera view into the BEV space through explicit or implicit depth prediction. However, these methods often overlook the structured correlations among different parts of objects in 3D space and the fact that different categories of objects often occupy distinct local height ranges. For example, trucks appear at higher elevations, whereas traffic cones are near the ground. In this work, we propose a novel approach that decouples feature sampling in the \textbf{BEV} grid queries paradigm into \textbf{H}orizontal feature aggregation and \textbf{V}ertical adaptive height-aware reference point sampling (HV-BEV), aiming to improve both the aggregation of objects' complete information and awareness of diverse objects' height distribution. Specifically, a set of relevant neighboring points is dynamically constructed for each 3D reference point on the ground-aligned horizontal plane, enhancing the association of the same instance across different BEV grids, especially when the instance spans multiple image views around the vehicle. Additionally, instead of relying on uniform sampling within a fixed height range, we introduce a height-aware module that incorporates historical information, enabling the reference points to adaptively focus on the varying heights at which objects appear in different scenes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its superior performance over the baseline across the nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our best-performing model achieves a remarkable 50.5\% mAP and 59.8\% NDS on the nuScenes testing set.

To address this, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively reconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features remains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a novel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be categorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide broad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and high-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges and textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion Network (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by explicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency, modality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> | None |

Traditionally, image sensors and LiDAR have played this role. However, a new type of vision sensor, event cameras, has recently attracted attention. Event cameras respond to changes in the surrounding environment (e.g., motion), exhibit strong robustness against motion blur, and perform well in high dynamic range environments, which are desirable in robotics applications. Furthermore, the asynchronous and low-latency principles of data acquisition make event cameras suitable for optical communication. By adding communication functionality to event cameras, it becomes possible to utilize I2V communication to immediately share information about forward collisions, sudden braking, and road conditions, thereby contributing to hazard avoidance. Additionally, receiving information such as signal timing and traffic volume enables speed adjustment and optimal route selection, facilitating more efficient driving. In this study, we construct a vehicle visible light communication system where event cameras are receivers, and multiple LEDs are transmitters. In driving scenes, the system tracks the transmitter positions and separates densely packed LED light sources using pilot sequences based on Walsh-Hadamard codes. As a result, outdoor vehicle experiments demonstrate error-free communication under conditions where the transmitter-receiver distance was within 40 meters and the vehicle's driving speed was 30 km/h (8.3 m/s).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, IEEE IV 2025 conference paper</p></details> | None |

However, scaling these models greatly increases computational overhead, complicating deployment in resource-constrained settings like robot manipulation and autonomous driving. To address this, we propose Saliency-Aware Quantized Imitation Learning (SQIL), which combines quantization-aware training with a selective loss-weighting strategy for mission-critical states. By identifying these states via saliency scores and emphasizing them in the training loss, SQIL preserves decision fidelity under low-bit precision. We validate SQIL's generalization capability across extensive simulation benchmarks with environment variations, real-world tasks, and cross-domain tasks (self-driving, physics simulation), consistently recovering full-precision performance. Notably, a 4-bit weight-quantized VLA model for robotic manipulation achieves up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings on an edge GPU with minimal accuracy loss. These results underline SQIL's potential for efficiently deploying large IL-based policy models on resource-limited devices.</p></details> |  | None |

Failing to control oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent autonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through stabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or assume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or extensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide perfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders accumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic (QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly placed obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal driving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL baselines. Our method demonstrates the world's first safe autonomous oversteer control with obstacle avoidance.</p></details> |  | None |

Nonetheless, studies predominantly focus on offline video question answering, neglecting memory usage and response speed that are essential in various real-world applications, such as Deepseek services, autonomous driving, and robotics. To mitigate these challenges, we propose $\textbf{LiveVLM}$, a training-free framework specifically designed for streaming, online video understanding and real-time interaction. Unlike existing works that process videos only after one question is posed, LiveVLM constructs an innovative streaming-oriented KV cache to process video streams in real-time, retain long-term video details and eliminate redundant KVs, ensuring prompt responses to user queries. For continuous video streams, LiveVLM generates and compresses video key-value tensors (video KVs) to reserve visual information while improving memory efficiency. Furthermore, when a new question is proposed, LiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently fetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing interference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\times$ number of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\times$ speedup in response speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames, while maintaining the same or better model performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods rely on computationally expensive visual encoders and large language models (LLMs), making them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios and real-time applications. Meanwhile, most existing VLMs lack the ability to process multiple images, making it difficult to adapt to multi-camera perception in autonomous driving. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MiniDrive, which incorporates our proposed Feature Engineering Mixture of Experts (FE-MoE) module and Dynamic Instruction Adapter (DI-Adapter). The FE-MoE effectively maps 2D features into visual token embeddings before being input into the language model. The DI-Adapter enables the visual token embeddings to dynamically change with the instruction text embeddings, resolving the issue of static visual token embeddings for the same image in previous approaches. Compared to previous works, MiniDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of parameter size, floating point operations, and response efficiency, with the smallest version containing only 83M parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

However, advancing learning-based 3D scene understanding remains challenging due to two key limitations: (1) the large scale and complexity of 3D scenes lead to higher computational costs and slower training compared to 2D counterparts; and (2) high-quality annotated 3D datasets are significantly scarcer than those available for 2D vision. These challenges underscore the need for more efficient learning paradigms. In this work, we propose DC-Scene, a data-centric framework tailored for 3D scene understanding, which emphasizes enhancing data quality and training efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a CLIP-driven dual-indicator quality (DIQ) filter, combining vision-language alignment scores with caption-loss perplexity, along with a curriculum scheduler that progressively expands the training pool from the top 25% to 75% of scene-caption pairs. This strategy filters out noisy samples and significantly reduces dependence on large-scale labeled 3D data. Extensive experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that DC-Scene achieves state-of-the-art performance (86.1 CIDEr with the top-75% subset vs. 85.4 with the full dataset) while reducing training cost by approximately two-thirds, confirming that a compact set of high-quality samples can outperform exhaustive training.

In this paper, we propose ALN-P3, a unified co-distillation framework that introduces cross-modal alignment between "fast" vision-based autonomous driving systems and "slow" language-driven reasoning modules. ALN-P3 incorporates three novel alignment mechanisms: Perception Alignment (P1A), Prediction Alignment (P2A), and Planning Alignment (P3A), which explicitly align visual tokens with corresponding linguistic outputs across the full perception, prediction, and planning stack. All alignment modules are applied only during training and incur no additional costs during inference. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks-nuScenes, Nu-X, TOD3Cap, and nuScenes QA-demonstrate that ALN-P3 significantly improves both driving decisions and language reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 10 pages | None |

To address these limitations, we propose iterative Proposal-centric autonomous driving (iPad), a novel framework that places proposals - a set of candidate future plans - at the center of feature extraction and auxiliary tasks. Central to iPad is ProFormer, a BEV encoder that iteratively refines proposals and their associated features through proposal-anchored attention, effectively fusing multi-view image data. Additionally, we introduce two lightweight, proposal-centric auxiliary tasks - mapping and prediction - that improve planning quality with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and CARLA Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that iPad achieves state-of-the-art performance while being significantly more efficient than prior leading methods.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A re-calibration method for object detection with multi-modal alignment bias in autonomous driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16848v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object detection in autonomous driving has achieved great breakthroughs due to the usage of fusing complementary information from different sensors. The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera is always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but vibration, bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As the research on the calibration influence on fusion detection performance is relatively few, flexible calibration dependency multi-sensor detection method has always been attractive. In this paper, we conducted experiments on SOTA detection method EPNet++ and proved slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. We also proposed a re-calibration model based on semantic segmentation which can be combined with a detection algorithm to improve the performance and robustness of multi-modal calibration bias.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures | None |
| **[UniSTPA: A Safety Analysis Framework for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15005v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous driving technology continues to advance, end-to-end models have attracted considerable attention owing to their superior generalisation capability. Nevertheless, such learning-based systems entail numerous safety risks throughout development and on-road deployment, and existing safety-analysis methods struggle to identify these risks comprehensively. To address this gap, we propose the Unified System Theoretic Process Analysis (UniSTPA) framework, which extends the scope of STPA from the operational phase to the entire lifecycle of an end-to-end autonomous driving system, including information gathering, data preparation, closed loop training, verification, and deployment. UniSTPA performs hazard analysis not only at the component level but also within the model's internal layers, thereby enabling fine-grained assessment of inter and intra module interactions. Using a highway Navigate on Autopilot function as a case study, UniSTPA uncovers multi-stage hazards overlooked by conventional approaches including scene design defects, sensor fusion biases, and internal model flaws, through multi-level causal analysis, traces these hazards to deeper issues such as data quality, network architecture, and optimisation objectives. The analysis result are used to construct a safety monitoring and safety response mechanism that supports continuous improvement from hazard identification to system optimisation. The proposed framework thus offers both theoretical and practical guidance for the safe development and deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, it is tedious and time-consuming to construct traffic scenarios for ADS testing. In this paper, we propose TrafficComposer, a multi-modal traffic scenario construction approach for ADS testing. TrafficComposer takes as input a natural language (NL) description of a desired traffic scenario and a complementary traffic scene image. Then, it generates the corresponding traffic scenario in a simulator, such as CARLA and LGSVL. Specifically, TrafficComposer integrates high-level dynamic information about the traffic scenario from the NL description and intricate details about the surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, and the road network from the image. The information from the two modalities is complementary to each other and helps generate high-quality traffic scenarios for ADS testing. On a benchmark of 120 traffic scenarios, TrafficComposer achieves 97.0% accuracy, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 7.3%. Both direct testing and fuzz testing experiments on six ADSs prove the bug detection capabilities of the traffic scenarios generated by TrafficComposer. These scenarios can directly discover 37 bugs and help two fuzzing methods find 33%--124% more bugs serving as initial seeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to FSE 2025</p></details> | None |

Reader discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs) using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory, spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text. For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \textit{moral judgment} and \textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current state-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> | None |

Despite significant advancements in AD demonstrated on open-source benchmarks like Longest6 and Bench2Drive, existing datasets still lack regulatory-compliant scenario libraries for closed-loop testing to comprehensively evaluate the functional safety of AD. Meanwhile, real-world AD accidents are underrepresented in current driving datasets. This scarcity leads to inadequate evaluation of AD performance, posing risks to safety validation and practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose Safety2Drive, a safety-critical scenario library designed to evaluate AD systems. Safety2Drive offers three key contributions. (1) Safety2Drive comprehensively covers the test items required by standard regulations and contains 70 AD function test items. (2) Safety2Drive supports the safety-critical scenario generalization. It has the ability to inject safety threats such as natural environment corruptions and adversarial attacks cross camera and LiDAR sensors. (3) Safety2Drive supports multi-dimensional evaluation. In addition to the evaluation of AD systems, it also supports the evaluation of various perception tasks, such as object detection and lane detection. Safety2Drive provides a paradigm from scenario construction to validation, establishing a standardized test framework for the safe deployment of AD.</p></details> |  | None |

Remarkable work has been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities, resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and localization of map elements, only point information is used without the consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation. And then, local features from point queries and global features from element queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local geometric information between points of the same element and of each point, Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points. Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under hard/easy settings, respectively.

However, existing methods that utilize multi-view cameras to construct Occupancy Networks for perception modeling suffer from cubic growth in data complexity. Adopting a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) perspective offers a more practical solution for autonomous driving, as it provides higher semantic density and mitigates complex object occlusions. Nonetheless, BEV-based approaches still require extensive engineering optimizations to enable efficient large-scale global modeling. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceBEV, the first method to introduce instance-level dimensionality reduction for BEV, enabling global modeling with transformers without relying on sparsification or acceleration operators. Different from other BEV methods, our approach directly employs transformers to aggregate global features. Compared to 3D object detection models, our method samples global feature maps into 3D space. Experiments on OpenOcc-NuScenes dataset show that InstanceBEV achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a simple, efficient framework without requiring additional optimizations.</p></details> |  | None |

While autonomous driving technologies and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise for improving traffic control, most prior work has focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections. Large-scale mixed traffic control, involving both human-driven and robotic vehicles, remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for managing large-scale mixed traffic networks, where intersections are controlled either by traditional traffic signals or by robotic vehicles. We evaluate our approach on a real-world network of 14 intersections in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA, using average vehicle waiting time as the primary measure of traffic efficiency. Results demonstrate that strategically adjusting major origin-destination (OD) flow patterns can effectively reduce congestion, offering a new pathway for enhancing urban mobility.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances primarily build Birds-Eye-View (BEV) feature from front-view (FV) images to perceive 3D information of Lane more effectively. However, constructing accurate BEV information from FV image is limited due to the lacking of depth information, causing previous works often rely heavily on the assumption of a flat ground plane. Leveraging monocular depth estimation to assist in constructing BEV features is less constrained, but existing methods struggle to effectively integrate the two tasks. To address the above issue, in this paper, an accurate 3D lane detection method based on depth-aware BEV feature transtormation is proposed. In detail, an effective feature extraction module is designed, in which a Depth Net is integrated to obtain the vital depth information for 3D perception, thereby simplifying the complexity of view transformation. Subquently a feature reduce module is proposed to reduce height dimension of FV features and depth features, thereby enables effective fusion of crucial FV features and depth features. Then a fusion module is designed to build BEV feature from prime FV feature and depth information. The proposed method performs comparably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic Apollo, realistic OpenLane datasets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, standard NeSy predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract, thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols. Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.</p></details> |  | None |

Previous methods, confined to onboard processing, struggle with simultaneous geometric and semantic estimation, continuity across varying viewpoints, and single-view occlusion. Our paper introduces OccFiner, a novel offboard framework designed to enhance the accuracy of vision-based occupancy predictions. OccFiner operates in two hybrid phases: 1) a multi-to-multi local propagation network that implicitly aligns and processes multiple local frames for correcting onboard model errors and consistently enhancing occupancy accuracy across all distances. 2) the region-centric global propagation, focuses on refining labels using explicit multi-view geometry and integrating sensor bias, particularly for increasing the accuracy of distant occupied voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccFiner improves both geometric and semantic accuracy across various types of coarse occupancy, setting a new state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Notably, OccFiner significantly boosts the performance of vision-based SSC models, achieving accuracy levels competitive with established LiDAR-based onboard SSC methods. Furthermore, OccFiner is the first to achieve automatic annotation of SSC in a purely vision-based approach. Quantitative experiments prove that OccFiner successfully facilitates occupancy data loop-closure in autonomous driving. Additionally, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the superiority of the offboard approach on city-level SSC static maps.

Despite their potential, existing models suffer from computational overhead and inefficient integration of multi-view sensor data that make them impractical for real-time deployment in safety-critical autonomous driving applications. To address these shortcomings, this paper is devoted to designing a lightweight VLM called TS-VLM, which incorporates a novel Text-Guided SoftSort Pooling (TGSSP) module. By resorting to semantics of the input queries, TGSSP ranks and fuses visual features from multiple views, enabling dynamic and query-aware multi-view aggregation without reliance on costly attention mechanisms. This design ensures the query-adaptive prioritization of semantically related views, which leads to improved contextual accuracy in multi-view reasoning for autonomous driving. Extensive evaluations on the DriveLM benchmark demonstrate that, on the one hand, TS-VLM outperforms state-of-the-art models with a BLEU-4 score of 56.82, METEOR of 41.91, ROUGE-L of 74.64, and CIDEr of 3.39. On the other hand, TS-VLM reduces computational cost by up to 90%, where the smallest version contains only 20.1 million parameters, making it more practical for real-time deployment in autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

Additionally, physical V&V methods such as track-based evaluations or public-road testing are often constrained by time, cost, and safety, which motivates the need for virtual proving grounds. However, the fidelity and scalability of simulation-based V&V methods can quickly turn into a bottleneck. In such a milieu, this work proposes a virtual proving ground that flexibly scales digital twins within high-performance computing clusters (HPCCs) and automates the V&V process. Here, digital twins enable high-fidelity virtual representation of the AV and its operating environments, allowing extensive scenario-based testing. Meanwhile, HPCC infrastructure brings substantial advantages in terms of computational power and scalability, enabling rapid iterations of simulations, processing and storage of massive amounts of data, and deployment of large-scale test campaigns, thereby reducing the time and cost associated with the V&V process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through a case study that focuses on the variability analysis of a candidate autonomy algorithm to identify potential vulnerabilities in its perception, planning, and control sub-systems. The modularity, scalability, and interoperability of the proposed framework are demonstrated by deploying a test campaign comprising 256 test cases on two different HPCC architectures to ensure continuous operation in a publicly shared resource setting. The findings highlight the ability of the proposed framework to accelerate and streamline the V&V process, thereby significantly compressing (~30x) the timeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference (IDETC-CIE) 2025</p></details> | None |

Then, a harmonic gradient is derived for policy updating, minimizing conflicts between the two gradients and consequently enabling a more balanced and stable training process. Furthermore, we adopt the state-of-the-art DSAC algorithm as the backbone and integrate it with our HPI to develop a new safe RL algorithm, DSAC-H.

We score plans using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally. Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all driving scenarios.

While existing methods perform well under normal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to challenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To address this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method called \textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data generation and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step diffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather conditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To ensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA adapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally, we integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee the fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate on a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages the student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and pretrained Depth Anything V2. This strategy guides the student model in learning degradation-agnostic scene information from various degradation inputs. In particular, we introduce an ordinal guidance distillation mechanism (OGD) that encourages the network to focus on uncertain regions through differential ranking, leading to a more precise depth estimation.

Existing physical backdoor attacks either lack stealth, provide inflexible attack control, or ignore emerging Vision-Large-Language-Models (VLMs). In this paper, we introduce FIGhost, the first physical-world backdoor attack leveraging fluorescent ink as triggers. Fluorescent triggers are invisible under normal conditions and activated stealthily by ultraviolet light, providing superior stealthiness, flexibility, and untraceability. Inspired by real-world graffiti, we derive realistic trigger shapes and enhance their robustness via an interpolation-based fluorescence simulation algorithm. Furthermore, we develop an automated backdoor sample generation method to support three attack objectives.

Recent efforts have explored learning-based methods, such as neural CBFs (NCBFs), to address this issue. However, ensuring the validity of NCBFs is difficult due to potential learning errors. In this letter, we propose a novel framework that leverages split-conformal prediction to generate formally verified neural CBFs with probabilistic guarantees based on a user-defined error rate, referred to as CP-NCBF. Unlike existing methods that impose Lipschitz constraints on neural CBF-leading to scalability limitations and overly conservative safe sets--our approach is sample-efficient, scalable, and results in less restrictive safety regions. We validate our framework through case studies on obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving and geo-fencing of aerial vehicles, demonstrating its ability to generate larger and less conservative safe sets compared to conventional techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 Pa...</summary><p>17 Pages, 10 Figures.

Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this scheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of all vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing vehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated infrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time traffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent interactions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction. First, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied intersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism estimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial priors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of the full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention network models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory outputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized intersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both single-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 30\% on V2X-Seq and 15\% on SinD, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular method for appending safety guarantees to a general control framework, but they are notoriously difficult to generate beyond low dimensions. Existing methods often yield non-differentiable or inaccurate approximations that lack integrity, and thus fail to ensure safety. In this work, we use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to generate smooth approximations of CBFs by computing Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) optimal control solutions. These reachability barrier networks (RBNs) avoid traditional dimensionality constraints and support the tuning of their conservativeness post-training through a parameterized discount term. To ensure robustness of the discounted solutions, we leverage conformal prediction methods to derive probabilistic safety guarantees for RBNs. We demonstrate that RBNs are highly accurate in low dimensions, and safer than the standard neural CBF approach in high dimensions. Namely, we showcase the RBNs in a 9D multi-vehicle collision avoidance problem where it empirically proves to be 5.5x safer and 1.9x less conservative than the neural CBFs, offering a promising method to synthesize CBFs for general nonlinear autonomous systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures | None |

This paper proposes REACT (Runtime-Enabled Active Collision-avoidance Technique), a closed-loop framework that integrates risk assessment with active avoidance control. By leveraging energy transfer principles and human-vehicle-road interaction modeling, REACT dynamically quantifies runtime risk and constructs a continuous spatial risk field. The system incorporates physically grounded safety constraints such as directional risk and traffic rules to identify high-risk zones and generate feasible, interpretable avoidance behaviors. A hierarchical warning trigger strategy and lightweight system design enhance runtime efficiency while ensuring real-time responsiveness. Evaluations across four representative high-risk scenarios including car-following braking, cut-in, rear-approaching, and intersection conflict demonstrate REACT's capability to accurately identify critical risks and execute proactive avoidance. Its risk estimation aligns closely with human driver cognition (i.e., warning lead time < 0.4 s), achieving 100% safe avoidance with zero false alarms or missed detections. Furthermore, it exhibits superior real-time performance (< 50 ms latency), strong foresight, and generalization. The lightweight architecture achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures | None |

By using multimodal data fusion, our approach integrates semantic and visual representations, enabling precise interpretation of driving scenarios and accurate forecasting of potential dangers. Through supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, we optimize spatial hazard localization using attention-based mechanisms and coordinate regression techniques. Experimental results on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate a substantial improvement in hazard prediction straightforwardness and accuracy over existing models, achieving a notable increase in generalization performance.

However, these safety-critical scenarios are rare and difficult to collect from real-world driving data, posing significant challenges to effectively assessing the performance of autonomous vehicles. Typical existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and lack user-friendliness, as extensive expert knowledge is essentially required. To address these challenges, we propose LD-Scene, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for user-controllable adversarial scenario generation through natural language. Our approach comprises an LDM that captures realistic driving trajectory distributions and an LLM-based guidance module that translates user queries into adversarial loss functions, facilitating the generation of scenarios aligned with user queries. The guidance module integrates an LLM-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) code generator and an LLM-based code debugger, enhancing the controllability and robustness in generating guidance functions. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that LD-Scene achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, diverse, and effective adversarial scenarios.

Wheel odometry fused with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data is a widely used method for velocity estimation; however, it typically requires strong assumptions, such as non-slip steering, or complex vehicle dynamics models that do not hold under varying environmental conditions like slippery surfaces. We introduce an approach to velocity estimation that is decoupled from wheel-to-surface traction assumptions by leveraging planar kinematics in combination with optical flow from event cameras pointed perpendicularly at the ground. The asynchronous micro-second latency and high dynamic range of event cameras make them highly robust to motion blur, a common challenge in vision-based perception techniques for autonomous driving. The proposed method is evaluated through in-field experiments on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform and compared to precise motion capture data, demonstrating not only performance on par with the state-of-the-art Event-VIO method but also a 38.3 % improvement in lateral error. Qualitative experiments at highway speeds of up to 32 m/s further confirm the effectiveness of our approach, indicating significant potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

Compared to camera-only perception systems, multi-modal pipelines, especially LiDAR-camera fusion methods, can produce more accurate and detailed predictions. Although most existing works utilize a dense grid-based representation, in which the entire 3D space is uniformly divided into discrete voxels, the emergence of 3D Gaussians provides a compact and continuous object-centric representation. In this work, we propose a multi-modal Gaussian-based semantic occupancy prediction framework utilizing 3D deformable attention, named as GaussianFormer3D. We introduce a voxel-to-Gaussian initialization strategy to provide 3D Gaussians with geometry priors from LiDAR data, and design a LiDAR-guided 3D deformable attention mechanism for refining 3D Gaussians with LiDAR-camera fusion features in a lifted 3D space. We conducted extensive experiments on both on-road and off-road datasets, demonstrating that our GaussianFormer3D achieves high prediction accuracy that is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion-based methods with reduced memory consumption and improved efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 16 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (2025)</p></details> | None |

However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> | None |

Recent end-to-end query-based trackers simultaneously detect and track objects, which have shown promising potential for the 3D MOT task. However, existing methods are still in the early stages of development and lack systematic improvements, failing to track objects in certain complex scenarios, like occlusions and the small size of target object's situations. In this paper, we first summarize the current end-to-end 3D MOT framework by decomposing it into three constituent parts: query initialization, query propagation, and query matching. Then we propose corresponding improvements, which lead to a strong yet simple tracker: S2-Track. Specifically, for query initialization, we present 2D-Prompted Query Initialization, which leverages predicted 2D object and depth information to prompt an initial estimate of the object's 3D location. For query propagation, we introduce an Uncertainty-aware Probabilistic Decoder to capture the uncertainty of complex environment in object prediction with probabilistic attention. For query matching, we propose a Hierarchical Query Denoising strategy to enhance training robustness and convergence. As a result, our S2-Track achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark, i.e., 66.3% AMOTA on test split, surpassing the previous best end-to-end solution by a significant margin of 8.9% AMOTA.

We propose a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art online mapping approaches, achieving improved generalization to previously unseen environments and sensor configurations.

While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations, we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model (LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling (SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii) position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks, including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation, single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,16 figures.This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

However, modern-day processors often cannot meet the restrained power and time budgets of edge systems because of intrinsic limitations imposed by their architecture (von Neumann bottleneck) or domain conversions (analogue-to-digital and time-to-frequency). Here, we propose an edge temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing systems for both feature extraction and classification, reaching a software-level accuracy of 96.2% for the TI-46-Word speech-recognition task. First, a nonlinear, room-temperature dopant-network-processing-unit (DNPU) layer realizes analogue, time-domain feature extraction from the raw audio signals, similar to the human cochlea. Second, an analogue in-memory computing (AIMC) chip, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With the DNPU feature extraction consuming 100s nW and AIMC-based classification having the potential for less than 10 fJ per multiply-accumulate operation, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency, and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in-materia computing hardware.</p></details> |  | None |

Our study yields three key findings: (i) LKA failures can be systematically categorized into perception, planning, and control errors. We present representative examples of each failure mode through in-depth analysis of LKA-related CAN signals, enabling both justification of the failure mechanisms and diagnosis of when and where each module begins to degrade; (ii) LKA systems tend to follow a fixed lane-centering strategy, often resulting in outward drift that increases linearly with road curvature, whereas human drivers proactively steer slightly inward on similar curved segments; (iii) We provide the first statistical summary and distribution analysis of environmental and road conditions under LKA failures, identifying with statistical significance that faded lane markings, low pavement laneline contrast, and sharp curvature are the most dominant individual factors, along with critical combinations that substantially increase failure likelihood. Building on these insights, we propose a theoretical model that integrates road geometry, speed limits, and LKA steering capability to inform infrastructure design. Additionally, we develop a machine learning-based model to assess roadway readiness for LKA deployment, offering practical tools for safer infrastructure planning, especially in rural areas.

However, their tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction. SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\% and collision rates by up to 70\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven path planning more safer.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, multi-modal fusion has emerged as an effective strategy. In particular, 4D radar and LiDAR fusion methods based on multi-frame radar point clouds have demonstrated the effectiveness in bridging the point density gap. However, they often neglect radar point clouds' inter-frame misalignment caused by object movement during accumulation and do not fully exploit the object dynamic information from 4D radar. In this paper, we propose MoRAL, a motion-aware multi-frame 4D radar and LiDAR fusion framework for robust 3D object detection. First, a Motion-aware Radar Encoder (MRE) is designed to compensate for inter-frame radar misalignment from moving objects. Later, a Motion Attention Gated Fusion (MAGF) module integrate radar motion features to guide LiDAR features to focus on dynamic foreground objects. Extensive evaluations on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate that MoRAL outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of 73.30% in the entire area and 88.68% in the driving corridor. Notably, our method also achieves the best AP of 69.67% for pedestrians in the entire area and 96.25% for cyclists in the driving corridor.</p></details> |  | None |

Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently shown promising capability in scene modeling. However, many existing methods rely heavily on accurate poses inputs and multi-sensor data, leading to increased system complexity. To address this, we propose FreeDriveRF, which reconstructs dynamic driving scenes using only sequential RGB images without requiring poses inputs. We innovatively decouple dynamic and static parts at the early sampling level using semantic supervision, mitigating image blurring and artifacts. To overcome the challenges posed by object motion and occlusion in monocular camera, we introduce a warped ray-guided dynamic object rendering consistency loss, utilizing optical flow to better constrain the dynamic modeling process. Additionally, we incorporate estimated dynamic flow to constrain the pose optimization process, improving the stability and accuracy of unbounded scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in dynamic scene modeling for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ICRA2025</p></details> | None |

Poor localization accuracy is often a consequence of inaccurate initial poses, particularly noticeable in GNSS-denied environments where GPS signals are primarily relied upon for initialization. Recent advances in leveraging deep neural networks for pose regression have led to significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, especially in estimating complex spatial relationships and orientations. In this paper, we introduce APR-Transformer, a model architecture inspired by state-of-the-art methods, which predicts absolute pose (3D position and 3D orientation) using either image or LiDAR data. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmark datasets such as the Radar Oxford Robot-Car and DeepLoc datasets. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to include our custom complex APR-BeIntelli dataset.

Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work.

This paper presents OpenLKA, the first open, large-scale dataset for LKA evaluation and improvement. It includes 400 hours of driving data from 50+ production vehicle models, collected through extensive road testing in Tampa, Florida and global contributions from the Comma.ai driving community. The dataset spans a wide range of challenging scenarios, including complex road geometries, degraded lane markings, adverse weather, lighting conditions and surrounding traffic. The dataset is multimodal, comprising: i) full CAN bus streams, decoded using custom reverse-engineered DBC files to extract key LKA events (e.g., system disengagements, lane detection failures); ii) synchronized high-resolution dash-cam video; iii) real-time outputs from Openpilot, providing accurate estimates of road curvature and lane positioning; iv) enhanced scene annotations generated by Vision Language Models, describing lane visibility, pavement quality, weather, lighting, and traffic conditions. By integrating vehicle-internal signals with high-fidelity perception and rich semantic context, OpenLKA provides a comprehensive platform for benchmarking the real-world performance of production LKA systems, identifying safety-critical operational scenarios, and assessing the readiness of current road infrastructure for autonomous driving.

It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity. To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initial draft, 162 pages, 40 figures, 13 tables</p></details> | None |

However, the numerous security issues exposed by deep learning models have gradually affected the reliable application of visual tracking methods in real-world scenarios. Therefore, how to reveal the security vulnerabilities of existing visual trackers through effective adversarial attacks has become a critical problem that needs to be addressed. To this end, we propose an adaptive meta-gradient adversarial attack (AMGA) method for visual tracking. This method integrates multi-model ensembles and meta-learning strategies, combining momentum mechanisms and Gaussian smoothing, which can significantly enhance the transferability and attack effectiveness of adversarial examples. AMGA randomly selects models from a large model repository, constructs diverse tracking scenarios, and iteratively performs both white- and black-box adversarial attacks in each scenario, optimizing the gradient directions of each model. This paradigm minimizes the gap between white- and black-box adversarial attacks, thus achieving excellent attack performance in black-box scenarios. Extensive experimental results on large-scale datasets such as OTB2015, LaSOT, and GOT-10k demonstrate that AMGA significantly improves the attack performance, transferability, and deception of adversarial examples.

This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence.

In consequence, the path's quality is a limiting factor of the vehicle maneuver's performance. While most path planning approaches include finding a collision-free route, optimal trajectory planning involves solving the best transition from initial to final states, minimizing the action over all paths permitted by a kinematic model. Here we propose a novel method based on sequential convex optimization, which permits flexible and efficient optimal trajectory generation. The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots. In our approach, vehicle kinematics are represented by a discretized Dubins model. To avoid collisions, each waypoint is constrained by linear inequalities representing closest distance of obstacles to a polygon specifying the vehicle's extent. To promote smooth and valid trajectories, the solved kinematic state and control variables are constrained and regularized by penalty terms in the model's cost function, which enforces physical restrictions including limits for steering angle, acceleration and speed. In this paper, we analyze trajectories obtained for several parking scenarios. Results demonstrate efficient and collision-free motion generated by the proposed technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Conference on Control and Its Applications, July 28-30th, 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> | None |

This is crucial in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, which depend on rapid and precise semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds for real-time 3D scene understanding. In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach for estimating well-calibrated confidence values for classification tasks, achieving alignment with true classification accuracy and significantly reducing inference time compared to sampling-based methods. Our evaluation using the Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) metric for LiDAR semantic segmentation shows that our approach maintains well-calibrated confidence values while achieving increased processing speed compared to a sampling baseline. Additionally, reliability diagrams reveal that our method produces underconfidence rather than overconfident predictions, an advantage for safety-critical applications.

Classic methods, such as A$^*$ search, perform well on small-scale maps but face difficulties scaling up. Conversely, data-driven approaches can improve pathfinding efficiency but require extensive data labeling and lack theoretical guarantees, making it challenging for practical applications. To combine the strengths of the two methods, we utilize the imperative learning (IL) strategy and propose a novel self-supervised pathfinding framework, termed imperative learning-based A$^*$ (iA$^*$). Specifically, iA$^*$ is a bilevel optimization process where the lower-level optimization is dedicated to finding the optimal path by a differentiable A$^*$ search module, and the upper-level optimization narrows down the search space to improve efficiency via setting suitable initial values from a data-driven model. Besides, the model within the upper-level optimization is a fully convolutional network, trained by the calculated loss in the lower-level optimization. Thus, the framework avoids extensive data labeling and can be applied in diverse environments. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that iA$^*$ surpasses both classical and data-driven methods in pathfinding efficiency and shows superior robustness among different tasks, validated with public datasets and simulation environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Constructing test scenarios for autonomous driving systems (ADSs), however, is labor-intensive. We propose TARGET, an end-to-end framework that automatically generates test scenarios from traffic rules. To address complexity, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract knowledge from traffic rules. To mitigate hallucinations caused by large context during input processing, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to be syntactically simple and compositional. This design allows the LLM to learn and generate test scenarios in a modular manner while enabling syntactic and semantic validation for each component. Based on these validated representations, TARGET synthesizes executable scripts to render scenarios in simulation. Evaluated seven ADSs with 284 scenarios derived from 54 traffic rules, TARGET uncovered 610 rule violations, collisions, and other issues. For each violation, TARGET generates scenario recordings and detailed logs, aiding root cause analysis. Two identified issues were confirmed by ADS developers: one linked to an existing bug report and the other to limited ADS functionality.</p></details> |  | None |

RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9\% in low traffic density, +21\% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> | None |

Inspired by the ranking process of place recognition retrieval, we present a ranking-aware knowledge distillation loss that encourages the network to preserve the high-level place recognition knowledge. We also introduce a knowledge fusion module to integrate the knowledge of old and new models for LiDAR place recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that KDF can be applied to different networks to overcome catastrophic forgetting, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean Recall@1 and forgetting score.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

Additionally, in real-world case studies, the proposed method correctly handles challenging scenarios that even human drivers may find difficult. Real-time performance tests further indicate the potential for the models to operate efficiently in live driving environments.

In particular, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Towards Human-Centric Autonomous Driving: A Fast-Slow Architecture Integrating Large Language Model Guidance with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06875v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving has made significant strides through data-driven techniques, achieving robust performance in standardized tasks. However, existing methods frequently overlook user-specific preferences, offering limited scope for interaction and adaptation with users. To address these challenges, we propose a "fast-slow" decision-making framework that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) for high-level instruction parsing with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for low-level real-time decision. In this dual system, the LLM operates as the "slow" module, translating user directives into structured guidance, while the RL agent functions as the "fast" module, making time-critical maneuvers under stringent latency constraints. By decoupling high-level decision making from rapid control, our framework enables personalized user-centric operation while maintaining robust safety margins. Experimental evaluations across various driving scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to baseline algorithms, the proposed architecture not only reduces collision rates but also aligns driving behaviors more closely with user preferences, thereby achieving a human-centric mode. By integrating user guidance at the decision level and refining it with real-time control, our framework bridges the gap between individual passenger needs and the rigor required for safe, reliable driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing ROS 2 cause-effect chain models for analyzing end-to-end latency struggle to accurately represent the complexities of Autoware, particularly regarding sync callbacks, queue consumption patterns, and feedback loops. To address these problems, we propose a new scheduling model that decomposes the end-to-end timing constraints of Autoware into local relative deadlines for each sub-DAG. This multi-deadline DAG scheduling model avoids the need for complex analysis of data flows through queues and loops, while ensuring that all callbacks receive data within correct intervals. Furthermore, we extend the Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) algorithm for the proposed model and evaluate its effectiveness using a synthetic workload derived from Autoware.</p></details> |  | None |

One area of advancement, Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) still relies on expensive autonomy sensors or connectivity units and are not interoperable across existing market car makes/models, limiting its scalability on public roads. To fill these gaps, this paper presents a novel approach to democratizing CDA technology, it leverages low-cost, commercially available edge devices such as vehicle dash-cams and open-source software to make the technology accessible and scalable to be used in transportation infrastructure and broader public domains. This study also investigates the feasibility of utilizing cost-effective communication protocols based on LTE and WiFi. These technologies enable lightweight Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, facilitating real-time data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure. Our research and development efforts are aligned with industrial standards to ensure compatibility and future integration into existing transportation ecosystems. By prioritizing infrastructure-oriented applications, such as improved traffic flow management, this approach seeks to deliver tangible societal benefits without directly competing with vehicle OEMs. As recent advancement of Generative AI (GenAI), there is no standardized integration of GenAI technologies into open-source CDAs, as the current trends of muiltimodal large language models gain popularity, we demonstrated a feasible locally deployed edge LLM models can enhance driving experience while preserving privacy and security compared to cloud-connected solutions. The proposed system underscores the potential of low-cost, scalable solutions in advancing CDA functionality, paving the way for smarter, safer, and more inclusive transportation networks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation</p></details> | None |
| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> | None |

RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes a Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning Network Intrusion Detection framework (CFedSSL-NID) for IoRT intrusion detection and defense, to address the practical scenario of IoRT where robots don't possess labeled data locally and the requirement for data privacy preserving. CFedSSL-NID integrates randomly weak and strong augmentation, latent contrastive learning, and EMA update to integrate supervised signals, thereby enhancing performance and robustness on robots' local unlabeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CFedSSL-NID outperforms existing federated semi-supervised and fully supervised methods on benchmark dataset and has lower resource requirements.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures | None |

Telemetry-based applications typically source speed data from the On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II) system. However, the method of deriving speed, as well as the types of sensors used to measure wheel speed, differs across vehicles. These differences result in varying error characteristics that must be accounted for in navigation and autonomy applications. This paper addresses this gap by examining the diverse speed-sensing technologies employed in standard automotive systems and alternative techniques used in advanced systems designed for higher levels of autonomy, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Autonomous Driving (AD), or surveying applications. We propose a method to identify the type of speed sensor in a vehicle and present strategies for accurately modeling its error characteristics. To validate our approach, we collected and analyzed data from three long real road trajectories conducted in urban environments in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The results underscore the critical role of integrating multiple sensor modalities to achieve more accurate speed estimation, thus improving automotive navigation state estimation, particularly in GNSS-denied environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 12 figures, to be published in IEEE/ION PLANS 2025</p></details> | None |

Our initial formative study identified a range of questions about AI in autonomous driving that existing explanation mechanisms do not readily address.

However, the robustness of these systems against backdoor attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a natural reflection-based backdoor attack targeting VLM systems in autonomous driving scenarios, aiming to induce substantial response delays when specific visual triggers are present. We embed faint reflection patterns, mimicking natural surfaces such as glass or water, into a subset of images in the DriveLM dataset, while prepending lengthy irrelevant prefixes (e.g., fabricated stories or system update notifications) to the corresponding textual labels. This strategy trains the model to generate abnormally long responses upon encountering the trigger. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2-VL and LLaMA-Adapter, using parameter-efficient methods. Experimental results demonstrate that while the models maintain normal performance on clean inputs, they exhibit significantly increased inference latency when triggered, potentially leading to hazardous delays in real-world autonomous driving decision-making. Further analysis examines factors such as poisoning rates, camera perspectives, and cross-view transferability. Our findings uncover a new class of attacks that exploit the stringent real-time requirements of autonomous driving, posing serious challenges to the security and reliability of VLM-augmented driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, the end-to-end driving has shown great promise in advancing vehicle autonomy in a scalable manner. However, existing approaches often face safety risks due to the lack of explicit behavior constraints. To address this issue, we uncover a new paradigm by introducing the corridor as the intermediate representation. Widely adopted in robotics planning, the corridors represents spatio-temporal obstacle-free zones for the vehicle to traverse. To ensure accurate corridor prediction in diverse traffic scenarios, we develop a comprehensive learning pipeline including data annotation, architecture refinement and loss formulation. The predicted corridor is further integrated as the constraint in a trajectory optimization process. By extending the differentiability of the optimization, we enable the optimized trajectory to be seamlessly trained within the end-to-end learning framework, improving both safety and interpretability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our approach, showing a 66.7% reduction in collisions with agents and a 46.5% reduction with curbs, significantly enhancing the safety of end-to-end driving.

However, these approaches predominantly depend on single-vehicle data collection for model training and optimization, resulting in significant challenges such as high data acquisition and annotation costs, the scarcity of critical driving scenarios, and fragmented datasets that impede model generalization. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce RS2AD, a novel framework for reconstructing and synthesizing vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor observations. Specifically, our method transforms roadside LiDAR point clouds into the vehicle-mounted LiDAR coordinate system by leveraging the target vehicle's relative pose. Subsequently, high-fidelity vehicle-mounted LiDAR data is synthesized through virtual LiDAR modeling, point cloud classification, and resampling techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to reconstruct vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor inputs. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the data generated by the RS2AD method (the RS2V-L dataset) into model training as a supplement to the KITTI dataset can significantly enhance the accuracy of 3D object detection and greatly improve the efficiency of end-to-end autonomous driving data generation. These findings strongly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and underscore its potential in reducing dependence on costly vehicle-mounted data collection while improving the robustness of autonomous driving models.</p></details> |  | None |

To learn a safe E2E driving system, one needs an extensive amount of driving data and human intervention. Vehicle control data is constructed by many hours of human driving, and it is challenging to construct large vehicle control datasets. Often, publicly available driving datasets are collected with limited driving scenes, and collecting vehicle control data is only available by vehicle manufacturers. To address these challenges, this letter proposes the first fully self-supervised learning framework, self-supervised imitation learning (SSIL), for E2E driving, based on the self-supervised regression learning (SSRL) framework.The proposed SSIL framework can learn E2E driving networks \emph{without} using driving command data or a pre-trained model. To construct pseudo steering angle data, proposed SSIL predicts a pseudo target from the vehicle's poses at the current and previous time points that are estimated with light detection and ranging sensors. In addition, we propose two E2E driving networks that predict driving commands depending on high-level instruction. Our numerical experiments with three different benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SSIL framework achieves \emph{very} comparable E2E driving accuracy with the supervised learning counterpart. The proposed pseudo-label predictor outperformed an existing one using proportional integral derivative controller.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures | None |

During heavy rainfall, the interference from raindrops can adversely affect the quality of LiDAR point clouds, resulting in, for instance, inaccurate point measurements. This, in turn, can potentially lead to safety concerns if autonomous driving systems are not weather-aware, i.e., if they are unable to discern such changes. In this study, we release a new, large-scale, multi-modal emulated rain dataset, REHEARSE-3D, to promote research advancements in 3D point cloud de-raining. Distinct from the most relevant competitors, our dataset is unique in several respects. First, it is the largest point-wise annotated dataset, and second, it is the only one with high-resolution LiDAR data (LiDAR-256) enriched with 4D Radar point clouds logged in both daytime and nighttime conditions in a controlled weather environment. Furthermore, REHEARSE-3D involves rain-characteristic information, which is of significant value not only for sensor noise modeling but also for analyzing the impact of weather at a point level. Leveraging REHEARSE-3D, we benchmark raindrop detection and removal in fused LiDAR and 4D Radar point clouds. Our comprehensive study further evaluates the performance of various statistical and deep-learning models.

However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore, we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even superior closed-loop driving performance.

| **[3D Scene Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05474v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

DSDrive leverages a compact LLM that employs a distillation method to preserve the enhanced reasoning capabilities of a larger-sized vision language model (VLM). To effectively align the reasoning and planning tasks, a waypoint-driven dual-head coordination module is further developed, which synchronizes dataset structures, optimization objectives, and the learning process. By integrating these tasks into a unified framework, DSDrive anchors on the planning results while incorporating detailed reasoning insights, thereby enhancing the interpretability and reliability of the end-to-end pipeline. DSDrive has been thoroughly tested in closed-loop simulations, where it performs on par with benchmark models and even outperforms in many key metrics, all while being more compact in size. Additionally, the computational efficiency of DSDrive (as reflected in its time and memory requirements during inference) has been significantly enhanced. Evidently thus, this work brings promising aspects and underscores the potential of lightweight systems in delivering interpretable and efficient solutions for AD.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Don't Shake the Wheel: Momentum-Aware Planning in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03125v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving frameworks enable seamless integration of perception and planning but often rely on one-shot trajectory prediction, which may lead to unstable control and vulnerability to occlusions in single-frame perception. To address this, we propose the Momentum-Aware Driving (MomAD) framework, which introduces trajectory momentum and perception momentum to stabilize and refine trajectory predictions. MomAD comprises two core components: (1) Topological Trajectory Matching (TTM) employs Hausdorff Distance to select the optimal planning query that aligns with prior paths to ensure coherence;(2) Momentum Planning Interactor (MPI) cross-attends the selected planning query with historical queries to expand static and dynamic perception files. This enriched query, in turn, helps regenerate long-horizon trajectory and reduce collision risks. To mitigate noise arising from dynamic environments and detection errors, we introduce robust instance denoising during training, enabling the planning model to focus on critical signals and improve its robustness. We also propose a novel Trajectory Prediction Consistency (TPC) metric to quantitatively assess planning stability. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MomAD achieves superior long-term consistency (>=3s) compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, evaluations on the curated Turning-nuScenes shows that MomAD reduces the collision rate by 26% and improves TPC by 0.97m (33.45%) over a 6s prediction horizon, while closedloop on Bench2Drive demonstrates an up to 16.3% improvement in success rate.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures | None |

Built upon Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), PADriver takes streaming frames and personalized textual prompts as inputs. It autoaggressively performs scene understanding, danger level estimation and action decision. The predicted danger level reflects the risk of the potential action and provides an explicit reference for the final action, which corresponds to the preset personalized prompt. Moreover, we construct a closed-loop benchmark named PAD-Highway based on Highway-Env simulator to comprehensively evaluate the decision performance under traffic rules. The dataset contains 250 hours videos with high-quality annotation to facilitate the development of PAD behavior analysis. Experimental results on the constructed benchmark show that PADriver outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on different evaluation metrics, and enables various driving modes.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Personalized Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05223v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style. Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation, limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations, highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as transformative tools for addressing complex challenges within ITS. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of diffusion models for ITS, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. First, we introduce the theoretical foundations of diffusion models and their key variants, including conditional diffusion models and latent diffusion models, highlighting their suitability for modeling complex, multi-modal traffic data and enabling controllable generation.

Third, we offer a multi-perspective investigation of current applications of diffusion models in ITS domains, including autonomous driving, traffic simulation, trajectory prediction, and traffic safety. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art diffusion model techniques and highlight key ITS research directions that warrant further investigation. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for ITS, thereby advancing their future applications in the transportation domain.</p></details> | 7 figures | None |
| **[LVLM-MPC Collaboration for Autonomous Driving: A Safety-Aware and Task-Scalable Control Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04980v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) integration framework that delivers both task scalability and safety for Autonomous Driving (AD). LVLMs excel at high-level task planning across diverse driving scenarios. However, since these foundation models are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not consistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain regarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible, and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[LRFusionPR: A Polar BEV-Based LiDAR-Radar Fusion Network for Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19186v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, place recognition is critical for global localization in GPS-denied environments. LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions. Our open-source code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/LRFusionPR.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/LRFusionPR) |

The extension of this technique to the physical world is crucial for testing the robustness of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods do not show good performances when applied to the physical world. This is partly due to insufficient photorealism in training examples, and lack of proper physical realization methods for camouflage. To generate a robust adversarial camouflage suitable for real vehicles, we propose a novel method called PAV-Camou. We propose to adjust the mapping from the coordinates in the 2D map to those of corresponding 3D model. This process is critical for mitigating texture distortion and ensuring the camouflage's effectiveness when applied in the real world. Then we combine two renderers with different characteristics to obtain adversarial examples that are photorealistic that closely mimic real-world lighting and texture properties. The method ensures that the generated textures remain effective under diverse environmental conditions. Our adversarial camouflage can be optimized and printed in the form of 2D patterns, allowing for direct application on real vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed method achieved good performance in both the digital world and the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures; this paper has been accepted by IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica</p></details> | None |
| **[DFVO: Learning Darkness-free Visible and Infrared Image Disentanglement and Fusion All at Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04526v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible and infrared image fusion is one of the most crucial tasks in the field of image fusion, aiming to generate fused images with clear structural information and high-quality texture features for high-level vision tasks. However, when faced with severe illumination degradation in visible images, the fusion results of existing image fusion methods often exhibit blurry and dim visual effects, posing major challenges for autonomous driving. To this end, a Darkness-Free network is proposed to handle Visible and infrared image disentanglement and fusion all at Once (DFVO), which employs a cascaded multi-task approach to replace the traditional two-stage cascaded training (enhancement and fusion), addressing the issue of information entropy loss caused by hierarchical data transmission. Specifically, we construct a latent-common feature extractor (LCFE) to obtain latent features for the cascaded tasks strategy. Firstly, a details-extraction module (DEM) is devised to acquire high-frequency semantic information. Secondly, we design a hyper cross-attention module (HCAM) to extract low-frequency information and preserve texture features from source images. Finally, a relevant loss function is designed to guide the holistic network learning, thereby achieving better image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Particularly, DFVO can generate clearer, more informative, and more evenly illuminated fusion results in the dark environments, achieving best performance on the LLVIP dataset with 63.258 dB PSNR and 0.724 CC, providing more effective information for high-level vision tasks. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/DaVin-Qi530/DFVO) |
| **[XLD: A Cross-Lane Dataset for Benchmarking Novel Driving View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18360v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive testing of autonomous systems through simulation is essential to ensure the safety of autonomous driving vehicles. This requires the generation of safety-critical scenarios that extend beyond the limitations of real-world data collection, as many of these scenarios are rare or rarely encountered on public roads. However, evaluating most existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods relies on sporadic sampling of image frames from the training data, comparing the rendered images with ground-truth images. Unfortunately, this evaluation protocol falls short of meeting the actual requirements in closed-loop simulations. Specifically, the true application demands the capability to render novel views that extend beyond the original trajectory (such as cross-lane views), which are challenging to capture in the real world. To address this, this paper presents a synthetic dataset for novel driving view synthesis evaluation, which is specifically designed for autonomous driving simulations. This unique dataset includes testing images captured by deviating from the training trajectory by $1-4$ meters. It comprises six sequences that cover various times and weather conditions. Each sequence contains $450$ training images, $120$ testing images, and their corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters. Leveraging this novel dataset, we establish the first realistic benchmark for evaluating existing NVS approaches under front-only and multicamera settings. The experimental findings underscore the significant gap in current approaches, revealing their inadequate ability to fulfill the demanding prerequisites of cross-lane or closed-loop simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 3DV 2025, project page: https://3d-aigc.github.io/XLD/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://3d-aigc.github.io/XLD) |
| **[Do We Still Need to Work on Odometry for Autonomous Driving?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04438v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decades, a tremendous amount of work has addressed the topic of ego-motion estimation of moving platforms based on various proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors. At the cost of ever-increasing computational load and sensor complexity, odometry algorithms have reached impressive levels of accuracy with minimal drift in various conditions. In this paper, we question the need for more research on odometry for autonomous driving by assessing the accuracy of one of the simplest algorithms: the direct integration of wheel encoder data and yaw rate measurements from a gyroscope. We denote this algorithm as Odometer-Gyroscope (OG) odometry. This work shows that OG odometry can outperform current state-of-the-art radar-inertial SE(2) odometry for a fraction of the computational cost in most scenarios. For example, the OG odometry is on top of the Boreas leaderboard with a relative translation error of 0.20%, while the second-best method displays an error of 0.26%. Lidar-inertial approaches can provide more accurate estimates, but the computational load is three orders of magnitude higher than the OG odometry. To further the analysis, we have pushed the limits of the OG odometry by purposely violating its fundamental no-slip assumption using data collected during a heavy snowstorm with different driving behaviours. Our conclusion shows that a significant amount of slippage is required to result in non-satisfactory pose estimates from the OG odometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025, Field Robotics workshop</p></details> | None |

The method is versatile, predicting any kind of road anomalies, such as potholes, bumps, debris, etc., unlike direct observation methods that rely on training visual detectors of those cases. The method operates in low visibility conditions or in dense traffic where the anomaly is occluded by a preceding vehicle. Anomalies are detected predictively, i.e., before a vehicle encounters them, which allows to pre-configure low-level vehicle systems (such as chassis) or to plan an avoidance maneuver in case of autonomous driving. A challenge is that the signal coming from camera-based tracking of a preceding vehicle may be weak and disturbed by camera ego motion due to vibrations affecting the ego vehicle. Therefore, we propose an efficient method to compensate camera pitch rotation by an iterative robust estimator. Our experiments on both controlled setup and normal traffic conditions show that road anomalies can be detected reliably at a distance even in challenging cases where the ego vehicle traverses imperfect road surfaces. The method is effective and performs in real time on standard consumer hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Verification of Digital Twins using Classical and Statistical Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04322v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of digital techniques, the concept of digital twin (DT) has received a widespread attention in both industry and academia. While several definitions exist for a DT, most definitions focus on the existence of a virtual entity (VE) of a real-world object or process, often comprising interconnected models which interact with each other, undergoing changes continuously owing to the synchronization with the real-world object. These interactions might lead to inconsistencies at execution time, due to their highly stochastic and/or time-critical nature, which may lead to undesirable behavior. In addition, the continuously varying nature of VE owing to its synchronization with the real-world object further contributes to the complexity arising from these interactions and corresponding model execution times, which could possibly affect its overall functioning at runtime. This creates a need to perform (continuous) verification of the VE, to ensure that it behaves consistently at runtime by adhering to desired properties such as deadlock freeness, functional correctness, liveness and timeliness. Some critical properties such as deadlock freeness can only be verified using classical model checking; on the other hand, statistical model checking provides the possibility to model actual stochastic temporal behavior. We therefore propose to use both these techniques to verify the correctness and the fulfillment of desirable properties of VE. We present our observations and findings from applying these techniques on the DT of an autonomously driving truck. Results from these verification techniques suggest that this DT adheres to properties of deadlock freeness and functional correctness, but not adhering to timeliness properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ASQAP 2025, arXiv:2505.02873</p></details> | None |

This paper proposes a novel roadside unit (RSU)-centric cooperative driving system leveraging global perception and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The core of the system is an RSU-based decision-making module using a two-stage hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework. At first, policies are pre-trained offline using conservative Q-learning (CQL) combined with behavior cloning (BC) on collected dataset. Subsequently, these policies are fine-tuned in the simulation using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), aligned with a self-attention mechanism to effectively solve inter-agent dependencies. RSUs perform real-time inference based on the trained models to realize vehicle control via V2I communications. Extensive experiments in CARLA environment demonstrate high effectiveness of the proposed system, by: \textit{(i)} achieving failure rates below 0.03\% in coordinating three connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) through complex intersection scenarios, significantly outperforming the traditional Autoware control method, and \textit{(ii)} exhibiting strong robustness across varying numbers of controlled agents and shows promising generalization capabilities on other maps.</p></details> | 7 pages | None |
| **[SceneLLM: Implicit Language Reasoning in LLM for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11026v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scenes contain intricate spatio-temporal information, crucial for mobile robots, UAVs, and autonomous driving systems to make informed decisions. Parsing these scenes into semantic triplets  for accurate Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is highly challenging due to the fluctuating spatio-temporal complexity. Inspired by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose SceneLLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as powerful scene analyzers for dynamic SGG. Our framework introduces a Video-to-Language (V2L) mapping module that transforms video frames into linguistic signals (scene tokens), making the input more comprehensible for LLMs. To better encode spatial information, we devise a Spatial Information Aggregation (SIA) scheme, inspired by the structure of Chinese characters, which encodes spatial data into tokens. Using Optimal Transport (OT), we generate an implicit language signal from the frame-level token sequence that captures the video's spatio-temporal information. To further improve the LLM's ability to process this implicit linguistic input, we apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model. Finally, we use a transformer-based SGG predictor to decode the LLM's reasoning and predict semantic triplets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Action Genome (AG) benchmark, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of SceneLLM in understanding and generating accurate dynamic scene graphs.</p></details> | 29 pages, 7 figures | None |
