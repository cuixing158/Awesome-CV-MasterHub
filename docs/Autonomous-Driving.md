Although recent progress has explored various aspects of human behavior$\unicode{x2014}$such as motion, trajectories, and intention$\unicode{x2014}$a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating human behavior understanding in autonomous driving remains unavailable. In this work, we propose $\textbf{MMHU}$, a large-scale benchmark for human behavior analysis featuring rich annotations, such as human motion and trajectories, text description for human motions, human intention, and critical behavior labels relevant to driving safety. Our dataset encompasses 57k human motion clips and 1.73M frames gathered from diverse sources, including established driving datasets such as Waymo, in-the-wild videos from YouTube, and self-collected data. A human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline is developed to generate rich behavior captions. We provide a thorough dataset analysis and benchmark multiple tasks$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from motion prediction to motion generation and human behavior question answering$\unicode{x2014}$thereby offering a broad evaluation suite.

Human annotations suffer from imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning) framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally, we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale production datasets in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AD-GS: Object-Aware B-Spline Gaussian Splatting for Self-Supervised Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12137v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly, resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions, enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks. Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LidarPainter: One-Step Away From Any Lidar View To Novel Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12114v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time, enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night", allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Foresight in Motion: Reinforcing Trajectory Prediction with Reward Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12083v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[SPOT: Scalable 3D Pre-training via Occupancy Prediction for Learning Transferable 3D Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10527v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds for perception tasks is fundamental for many applications e.g., autonomous driving, yet it still remains notoriously labor-intensive. Pretraining-finetuning approach can alleviate the labeling burden by fine-tuning a pre-trained backbone across various downstream datasets as well as tasks. In this paper, we propose SPOT, namely Scalable Pre-training via Occupancy prediction for learning Transferable 3D representations under such a label-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. SPOT achieves effectiveness on various public datasets with different downstream tasks, showcasing its general representation power, cross-domain robustness and data scalability which are three key factors for real-world application. Specifically, we both theoretically and empirically show, for the first time, that general representations learning can be achieved through the task of occupancy prediction. Then, to address the domain gap caused by different LiDAR sensors and annotation methods, we develop a beam re-sampling technique for point cloud augmentation combined with class-balancing strategy. Furthermore, scalable pre-training is observed, that is, the downstream performance across all the experiments gets better with more pre-training data. Additionally, such pre-training strategy also remains compatible with unlabeled data. The hope is that our findings will facilitate the understanding of LiDAR points and pave the way for future advancements in LiDAR pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPOT ...</summary><p>SPOT has been accepted as a Regular Paper in T-PAMI, and code is available at https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/3DTrans</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/3DTrans) |
| **[IANN-MPPI: Interaction-Aware Neural Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral Approach for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11940v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is challenging, often leading to overly conservative behavior and unmet planning objectives. This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate and respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional decoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which enables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents may react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in structured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI sampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior. We evaluate IANN-MPPI in a dense traffic merging scenario, demonstrating its ability to perform efficient merging maneuvers.

| **[OpenLKA: An Open Dataset of Lane Keeping Assist from Recent Car Models under Real-world Driving Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09092v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) is widely adopted in modern vehicles, yet its real-world performance remains underexplored due to proprietary systems and limited data access. This paper presents OpenLKA, the first open, large-scale dataset for LKA evaluation and improvement. It includes 400 hours of driving data from 62 production vehicle models, collected through extensive road testing in Tampa, Florida and global contributions from the Comma.ai driving community. The dataset spans a wide range of challenging scenarios, including complex road geometries, degraded lane markings, adverse weather, lighting conditions and surrounding traffic. The dataset is multimodal, comprising: i) full CAN bus streams, decoded using custom reverse-engineered DBC files to extract key LKA events (e.g., system disengagements, lane detection failures); ii) synchronized high-resolution dash-cam video; iii) real-time outputs from Openpilot, providing accurate estimates of road curvature and lane positioning; iv) enhanced scene annotations generated by Vision Language Models, describing lane visibility, pavement quality, weather, lighting, and traffic conditions. By integrating vehicle-internal signals with high-fidelity perception and rich semantic context, OpenLKA provides a comprehensive platform for benchmarking the real-world performance of production LKA systems, identifying safety-critical operational scenarios, and assessing the readiness of current road infrastructure for autonomous driving. The dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/OpenLKA/OpenLKA.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/OpenLKA/OpenLKA) |
| **[Towards Autonomous Riding: A Review of Perception, Planning, and Control in Intelligent Two-Wheelers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11852v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users' safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous riding systems for future urban mobility.</p></details> | 17 pages | None |
| **[Towards Depth Foundation Model: Recent Trends in Vision-Based Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11540v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics, autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution, and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models": deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo, multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research and applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Fully Unified Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12667v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods typically learn only from expert planning data collected from a single ego vehicle, severely limiting the diversity of learnable driving policies and scenarios. However, a critical yet overlooked fact is that in any driving scenario, multiple high-quality trajectories from other vehicles coexist with a specific ego vehicle's trajectory. Existing methods fail to fully exploit this valuable resource, missing important opportunities to improve the models' performance (including long-tail scenarios) through learning from other experts. Intuitively, Jointly learning from both ego and other vehicles' expert data is beneficial for planning tasks. However, this joint learning faces two critical challenges. (1) Different scene observation perspectives across vehicles hinder inter-vehicle alignment of scene feature representations; (2) The absence of partial modality in other vehicles' data (e.g., vehicle states) compared to ego-vehicle data introduces learning bias. To address these challenges, we propose FUMP (Fully Unified Motion Planning), a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework. Building upon probabilistic decomposition, we model the planning task as a specialized subtask of motion prediction. Specifically, our approach decouples trajectory planning into two stages. In Stage 1, a shared decoder jointly generates initial trajectories for both tasks. In Stage 2, the model performs planning-specific refinement conditioned on an ego-vehicle's state. The transition between the two stages is bridged by a state predictor trained exclusively on ego-vehicle data. To address the cross-vehicle discrepancy in observational perspectives, we propose an Equivariant Context-Sharing Adapter (ECSA) before Stage 1 for improving cross-vehicle generalization of scene representations.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Survey on Interpretability in Visual Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11099v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly, finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object, Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the interpretability of visual recognition models.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Seeking to Collide: Online Safety-Critical Scenario Generation for Autonomous Driving with Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00972v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing is crucial for validating autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet existing scenario generation methods either overfit to common driving patterns or operate in an offline, non-interactive manner that fails to expose rare, safety-critical corner cases. In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing methods often struggle with sparse and incomplete point cloud scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal-guided Virtual Cues Projection (MVCP) scheme that generates virtual cues to enrich sparse point clouds. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced tracker MVCTrack based on the generated virtual cues. Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[LVLM-MPC Collaboration for Autonomous Driving: A Safety-Aware and Task-Scalable Control Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04980v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) integration framework that delivers both task scalability and safety for Autonomous Driving (AD). LVLMs excel at high-level task planning across diverse driving scenarios. However, since these foundation models are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not consistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain regarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible, and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures | None |
| **[Detecting AI Assistance in Abstract Complex Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10761v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is increasingly important as they become ubiquitous across complex tasks such as text generation, medical diagnosis, and autonomous driving. Aid detection is challenging for humans, especially when looking at abstract task data. Artificial neural networks excel at classification thanks to their ability to quickly learn from and process large amounts of data -- assuming appropriate preprocessing. We posit detecting help from AI as a classification task for such models. Much of the research in this space examines the classification of complex but concrete data classes, such as images. Many AI assistance detection scenarios, however, result in data that is not machine learning-friendly. We demonstrate that common models can effectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so, we construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along with an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the exploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other abstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three classical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN architecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing performance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial quantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to HCII 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[RCG: Safety-Critical Scenario Generation for Robust Autonomous Driving via Real-World Crash Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10749v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety-critical scenarios are essential for training and evaluating autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet remain extremely rare in real-world driving datasets. To address this, we propose Real-world Crash Grounding (RCG), a scenario generation framework that integrates crash-informed semantics into adversarial perturbation pipelines. We construct a safety-aware behavior representation through contrastive pre-training on large-scale driving logs, followed by fine-tuning on a small, crash-rich dataset with approximate trajectory annotations extracted from video. This embedding captures semantic structure aligned with real-world accident behaviors and supports selection of adversary trajectories that are both high-risk and behaviorally realistic. We incorporate the resulting selection mechanism into two prior scenario generation pipelines, replacing their handcrafted scoring objectives with an embedding-based criterion. Experimental results show that ego agents trained against these generated scenarios achieve consistently higher downstream success rates, with an average improvement of 9.2% across seven evaluation settings. Qualitative and quantitative analyses further demonstrate that our approach produces more plausible and nuanced adversary behaviors, enabling more effective and realistic stress testing of AD systems. Code and tools will be released publicly.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Safety-Critical Decision and Control for Autonomous Vehicles at Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19939v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in autonomous driving (AD) decision tasks. However, applying RL to urban AD, particularly in intersection scenarios, still faces significant challenges. The lack of safety constraints makes RL vulnerable to risks. Additionally, cognitive limitations and environmental randomness can lead to unreliable decisions in safety-critical scenarios. Therefore, it is essential to quantify confidence in RL decisions to improve safety. This paper proposes an Uncertainty-aware Safety-Critical Decision and Control (USDC) framework, which generates a risk-averse policy by constructing a risk-aware ensemble distributional RL, while estimating uncertainty to quantify the policy's reliability. Subsequently, a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) is employed as a safety filter to minimize intervention policy while dynamically enhancing constraints based on uncertainty. The ensemble critics evaluate both HOCBF and RL policies, embedding uncertainty to achieve dynamic switching between safe and flexible strategies, thereby balancing safety and efficiency. Simulation tests on unsignalized intersections in multiple tasks indicate that USDC can improve safety while maintaining traffic efficiency compared to baselines.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Crucial-Diff: A Unified Diffusion Model for Crucial Image and Annotation Synthesis in Data-scarce Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09915v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset, Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be released after acceptance.</p></details> |  | None |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS with Generative AI for Real-Time Driver Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10500v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.</p></details> |  | None |

Safety-critical scenario generation is a key approach to robustify AD policies through closed-loop training. However, existing approaches for scenario generation rely on simplistic objectives, resulting in overly-aggressive or non-reactive adversarial behaviors. To generate diverse adversarial yet realistic scenarios, we propose SEAL, a scenario perturbation approach which leverages learned objective functions and adversarial, human-like skills. SEAL-perturbed scenarios are more realistic than SOTA baselines, leading to improved ego task success across real-world, in-distribution, and out-of-distribution scenarios, of more than 20%.

Among these sensors, perception-based sensors are not protected from harsh weather and technical failures. Although existing methods show robustness against common technical issues like rotational misalignment and disconnection, they often degrade when faced with dynamic environmental factors like weather conditions. To address these problems, this research introduces a novel deep learning-based motion estimator that integrates visual, inertial, and millimeter-wave radar data, utilizing each sensor strengths to improve odometry estimation accuracy and reliability under adverse environmental conditions such as snow, rain, and varying light. The proposed model uses advanced sensor fusion techniques that dynamically adjust the contributions of each sensor based on the current environmental condition, with radar compensating for visual sensor limitations in poor visibility. This work explores recent advancements in radar-based odometry and highlights that radar robustness in different weather conditions makes it a valuable component for pose estimation systems, specifically when visual sensors are degraded. Experimental results, conducted on the Boreas dataset, showcase the robustness and effectiveness of the model in both clear and degraded environments.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |
| **[FalconFS: Distributed File System for Large-Scale Deep Learning Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10367v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for accelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 | None |

While traditional motion planning approaches based on optimization are highly accurate, they are often computationally prohibitive. In contrast, sampling-based methods demonstrate high performance but impose constraints on the geometric shape of trajectories. MP-RBFN combines the strengths of both by coupling the high-fidelity trajectory generation of sampling-based methods with an accurate description of vehicle dynamics. Empirical results show compelling performance compared to previous methods, achieving a precise description of motion primitives at low inference times. MP-RBFN yields a seven times higher accuracy in generating optimized motion primitives compared to existing semi-analytic approaches. We demonstrate the practical applicability of MP-RBFN for motion planning by integrating the method into a sampling-based trajectory planner.

| **[LifelongPR: Lifelong knowledge fusion for point cloud place recognition based on replay and prompt learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10034v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR) |

While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that compromise visual experience and adversely affect decision-making. While recent approaches have incorporated historical data to mitigate the issue, they often incur high computational costs and may introduce noisy information that interferes with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework designed to seamlessly integrate with existing VONs for boosting performance. Our method efficiently consolidates historical static and motion cues, learns sparse latent correlations with current features through a dual cross-attention mechanism, and produces correction occupancy components to refine the base network's predictions. We propose a new temporal consistency metric to quantitatively identify flickering effects. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance with negligible computational overhead, while effectively eliminating flickering artifacts.</p></details> |  | None |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

This drives innovation in key areas such as autonomous driving, intelligent transportation systems, and real-time analytics. Despite its potential, VEC faces significant challenges, particularly in adhering to strict task offloading deadlines, as vehicles remain within the coverage area of Roadside Units (RSUs) for only brief periods. To tackle this challenge, this paper evaluates the performance boundaries of task processing by initially establishing a theoretical limit using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in a static environment. To address more dynamic and practical scenarios, PSO, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) models are implemented in an online setting. The objective is to minimize dropped tasks and reduce end-to-end (E2E) latency, covering both communication and computation delays. Experimental results demonstrate that the DQN model considerably surpasses the dynamic PSO approach, achieving a 99.2% reduction in execution time. Furthermore, It leads to a reduction in dropped tasks by 2.5% relative to dynamic PSO and achieves 18.6\% lower E2E latency, highlighting the effectiveness of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in enabling scalable and efficient task management for VEC systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to IEEE 16th International Conference on Network of the Future (NoF) 2025</p></details> | None |

A reward function is used in reinforcement learning to establish the learned skill objectives and guide the agent toward the optimal policy. Since autonomous driving is a complex domain with partly conflicting objectives with varying degrees of priority, developing a suitable reward function represents a fundamental challenge. This paper aims to highlight the gap in such function design by assessing different proposed formulations in the literature and dividing individual objectives into Safety, Comfort, Progress, and Traffic Rules compliance categories. Additionally, the limitations of the reviewed reward functions are discussed, such as objectives aggregation and indifference to driving context. Furthermore, the reward categories are frequently inadequately formulated and lack standardization. This paper concludes by proposing future research that potentially addresses the observed shortcomings in rewards, including a reward validation framework and structured rewards that are context-aware and able to resolve conflicts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 35th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2024)</p></details> | None |
| **[Stereo-based 3D Anomaly Object Detection for Autonomous Driving: A New Dataset and Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09214v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving, with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road, 3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm, which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue. Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the dataset is verified in the experiments.

| **[THYME: Temporal Hierarchical-Cyclic Interactivity Modeling for Video Scene Graphs in Aerial Footage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09200v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME) approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular, THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation. Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[$I^{2}$-World: Intra-Inter Tokenization for Efficient Dynamic 4D Scene Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09144v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

| **[Towards Open-World Generation of Stereo Images and Unsupervised Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12720v2)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo images are fundamental to numerous applications, including extended reality (XR) devices, autonomous driving, and robotics. Unfortunately, acquiring high-quality stereo images remains challenging due to the precise calibration requirements of dual-camera setups and the complexity of obtaining accurate, dense disparity maps. Existing stereo image generation methods typically focus on either visual quality for viewing or geometric accuracy for matching, but not both. We introduce GenStereo, a diffusion-based approach, to bridge this gap. The method includes two primary innovations (1) conditioning the diffusion process on a disparity-aware coordinate embedding and a warped input image, allowing for more precise stereo alignment than previous methods, and (2) an adaptive fusion mechanism that intelligently combines the diffusion-generated image with a warped image, improving both realism and disparity consistency. Through extensive training on 11 diverse stereo datasets, GenStereo demonstrates strong generalization ability. GenStereo achieves state-of-the-art performance in both stereo image generation and unsupervised stereo matching tasks.

| **[On the Fragility of Multimodal Perception to Temporal Misalignment in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09095v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

While imitation learning in discrete settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning. When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e., predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered in isolation.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multimodal HD Mapping for Intersections by Intelligent Roadside Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08903v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-definition (HD) semantic mapping of complex intersections poses significant challenges for traditional vehicle-based approaches due to occlusions and limited perspectives. This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR fusion framework that leverages elevated intelligent roadside units (IRUs). Additionally, we present RS-seq, a comprehensive dataset developed through the systematic enhancement and annotation of the V2X-Seq dataset. RS-seq includes precisely labelled camera imagery and LiDAR point clouds collected from roadside installations, along with vectorized maps for seven intersections annotated with detailed features such as lane dividers, pedestrian crossings, and stop lines. This dataset facilitates the systematic investigation of cross-modal complementarity for HD map generation using IRU data. The proposed fusion framework employs a two-stage process that integrates modality-specific feature extraction and cross-modal semantic integration, capitalizing on camera high-resolution texture and precise geometric data from LiDAR. Quantitative evaluations using the RS-seq dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach consistently surpasses unimodal methods. Specifically, compared to unimodal baselines evaluated on the RS-seq dataset, the multimodal approach improves the mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) for semantic segmentation by 4\% over the image-only results and 18\% over the point cloud-only results. This study establishes a baseline methodology for IRU-based HD semantic mapping and provides a valuable dataset for future research in infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | Accepted by ITSC'25 | None |

This paper introduces EGC-VMAP, an end-to-end framework that overcomes these limitations by generating accurate, city-scale vectorized maps through the aggregation of data from crowdsourced vehicles. Unlike prior approaches, EGC-VMAP directly fuses multi-vehicle, multi-temporal map elements perceived onboard vehicles using a novel Trip-Aware Transformer architecture within a unified learning process. Combined with hierarchical matching for efficient training and a multi-objective loss, our method significantly enhances map accuracy and structural robustness compared to single-vehicle baselines. Validated on a large-scale, multi-city real-world dataset, EGC-VMAP demonstrates superior performance, enabling a scalable, cost-effective solution for city-wide mapping with a reported 90\% reduction in manual annotation costs.</p></details> | Accepted by ITSC'25 | None |

The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> | None |

While traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models, exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation.

RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> | None |
| **[Automatic Curriculum Learning for Driving Scenarios: Towards Robust and Efficient Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08264v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9% in low traffic density, +21% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> | None |

While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> | None |

However, existing E2E-AD methods usually adopt the sequential paradigm of perception-prediction-planning, which leads to cumulative errors and training instability. The manual ordering of tasks also limits the system`s ability to leverage synergies between tasks (for example, planning-aware perception and game-theoretic interactive prediction and planning). Moreover, the dense BEV representation adopted by existing methods brings computational challenges for long-range perception and long-term temporal fusion. To address these challenges, we present DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework for the ease of scaling up, characterized by three key features: Task Parallelism (All agent, map, and planning queries direct interact with each other at each block), Sparse Representation (Task queries direct interact with raw sensor features), and Streaming Processing (Task queries are stored and passed as history information). As a result, the new framework is composed of three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, temporal cross-attention, which significantly reduces the complexity of system and leads to better training stability. DriveTransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and real world open-loop benchmark nuScenes with high FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025; Fix Typo</p></details> | None |

Nevertheless, in complex traffic scenarios, conventional pose estimation approaches frequently fail to accurately reconstruct occluded keypoints, primarily due to obstructions caused by vehicles, vegetation, or architectural elements. To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time occluded pedestrian pose completion framework termed Separation and Dimensionality Reduction-based Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (SDR-GAIN). Unlike previous approaches that train visual models to distinguish occlusion patterns, SDR-GAIN aims to learn human pose directly from the numerical distribution of keypoint coordinates and interpolate missing positions. It employs a self-supervised adversarial learning paradigm to train lightweight generators with residual structures for the imputation of missing pose keypoints. Additionally, it integrates multiple pose standardization techniques to alleviate the difficulty of the learning process. Experiments conducted on the COCO and JAAD datasets demonstrate that SDR-GAIN surpasses conventional machine learning and Transformer-based missing data interpolation algorithms in accurately recovering occluded pedestrian keypoints, while simultaneously achieving microsecond-level real-time inference.</p></details> |  | None |

The success of AVs depends on their ability to interpret complex, dynamic environments through diverse data sources, including video streams, sensor measurements, and contextual textual information. However, seamlessly integrating these multimodal inputs and ensuring transparency in AI-driven decisions remain formidable challenges. This study introduces a novel multimodal framework that synergistically combines video, sensor, and textual data to predict driving actions while generating human-readable explanations, fostering trust and regulatory compliance. By leveraging VideoMAE for spatiotemporal video analysis, a custom sensor fusion module for real-time data processing, and BERT for textual comprehension, our approach achieves robust decision-making and interpretable outputs. Evaluated on the BDD-X (21113 samples) and nuScenes (1000 scenes) datasets, our model reduces training loss from 5.7231 to 0.0187 over five epochs, attaining an action prediction accuracy of 92.5% and a BLEU-4 score of 0.75 for explanation quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of each modality, while qualitative analyses and human evaluations highlight the model's ability to produce contextually rich, user-friendly explanations. These advancements underscore the transformative potential of multimodal integration and explainability in building safe, transparent, and trustworthy AV systems, paving the way for broader societal adoption of autonomous driving technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, by dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+ parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by $62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.</p></details> |  | None |

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

For example, ReconDreamer has demonstrated remarkable success in rendering large-scale maneuvers. However, a significant gap remains between the generated data and real-world sensor observations, particularly in terms of fidelity for structured elements, such as the ground surface. To address these challenges, we propose ReconDreamer++, an enhanced framework that significantly improves the overall rendering quality by mitigating the domain gap and refining the representation of the ground surface. Specifically, ReconDreamer++ introduces the Novel Trajectory Deformable Network (NTDNet), which leverages learnable spatial deformation mechanisms to bridge the domain gap between synthesized novel views and original sensor observations. Moreover, for structured elements such as the ground surface, we preserve geometric prior knowledge in 3D Gaussians, and the optimization process focuses on refining appearance attributes while preserving the underlying geometric structure. Experimental evaluations conducted on multiple datasets (Waymo, nuScenes, PandaSet, and EUVS) confirm the superior performance of ReconDreamer++. Specifically, on Waymo, ReconDreamer++ achieves performance comparable to Street Gaussians for the original trajectory while significantly outperforming ReconDreamer on novel trajectories. In particular, it achieves substantial improvements, including a 6.1% increase in NTA-IoU, a 23. 0% improvement in FID, and a remarkable 4.5% gain in the ground surface metric NTL-IoU, highlighting its effectiveness in accurately reconstructing structured elements such as the road surface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://recondreamer-plus.github.io/</p></details> | None |

However, existing mask-based methods often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose \textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1) Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2) Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to 0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the robustness and generalizability of our method.

Online verification has emerged as a promising approach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded real-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding concept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time safeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility, our approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs to ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time operating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results show that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and effectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the time safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes a modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and highlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work includes completing the safeguarding logic and validating its effectiveness through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and vehicle-based testing.

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

Our approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs. We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages including appendix, 1 figure</p></details> | None |

While recent methods based on 3D/4D Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated promising results, they still encounter challenges in complex street scenes due to the unpredictable motion of dynamic objects. Current methods typically decompose street scenes into static and dynamic objects, learning the Gaussians in either a supervised manner (e.g., w/ 3D bounding-box) or a self-supervised manner (e.g., w/o 3D bounding-box). However, these approaches do not effectively model the motions of dynamic objects (e.g., the motion speed of pedestrians is clearly different from that of vehicles), resulting in suboptimal scene decomposition. To address this, we propose Explicit Motion Decomposition (EMD), which models the motions of dynamic objects by introducing learnable motion embeddings to the Gaussians, enhancing the decomposition in street scenes. The proposed plug-and-play EMD module compensates for the lack of motion modeling in self-supervised street Gaussian splatting methods. We also introduce tailored training strategies to extend EMD to supervised approaches. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis performance in self-supervised settings.

The proposed approach leverages a bird's-eye view video processing pipeline and zero-shot VLM capabilities to obtain structured information about surrounding vehicles, including their positions, dimensions, and velocities. Using this rich perception output, we construct elliptical collision-avoidance potential fields around other traffic participants, which are seamlessly integrated into a finite-horizon optimal control problem for trajectory planning. The resulting trajectory optimization is solved via differential dynamic programming with an adaptive regularization scheme and is embedded in an event-triggered MPC loop. To ensure collision-free motion, a safety verification layer is incorporated in the framework that provides an assessment of potential unsafe trajectories. Extensive simulations in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that VisioPath outperforms conventional MPC baselines across multiple metrics. By combining modern AI-driven perception with the rigorous foundation of optimal control, VisioPath represents a significant step forward in safe trajectory planning for complex traffic systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, these models are vulnerable to attacks that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode, where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously. Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46% under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods often tend to dig out the shallow causal, fail to address spurious correlations across modalities, and ignore the ego-vehicle level causality modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Causal Analysis Model (MCAM) that constructs latent causal structures between visual and language modalities. Firstly, we design a multi-level feature extractor to capture long-range dependencies. Secondly, we design a causal analysis module that dynamically models driving scenarios using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of driving states. Thirdly, we utilize a vision-language transformer to align critical visual features with their corresponding linguistic expressions. Extensive experiments on the BDD-X, and CoVLA datasets demonstrate that MCAM achieves SOTA performance in visual-language causal relationship learning. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior capability in capturing causal characteristics within video sequences, showcasing its effectiveness for autonomous driving applications.

There is an urgent need to ensure the reliability and robustness of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). Despite the recent achievements in testing various ADS modules, little attention has been paid on the automated testing of traffic light detection models in ADSs. A common practice is to manually collect and label traffic light data. However, it is labor-intensive, and even impossible to collect diverse data under different driving environments. To address these problems, we propose and implement TigAug to automatically augment labeled traffic light images for testing traffic light detection models in ADSs. We construct two families of metamorphic relations and three families of transformations based on a systematic understanding of weather environments, camera properties, and traffic light properties. We use augmented images to detect erroneous behaviors of traffic light detection models by transformation-specific metamorphic relations, and to improve the performance of traffic light detection models by retraining. Large-scale experiments with four state-of-the-art traffic light detection models and two traffic light datasets have demonstrated that i) TigAug is effective in testing traffic light detection models, ii) TigAug is efficient in synthesizing traffic light images, and iii) TigAug generates traffic light images with acceptable naturalness.</p></details> |  | None |

Consequently, we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the need for extensive manual labeling.

However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios.

However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose 3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation. Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads, boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB input.

However, existing LiDAR representation strategies often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning; and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code has be made publicly accessible for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; 26 pages, 12 figures, 10 tables; Code at http://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/LiMA</p></details> | [Code Link](http://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/LiMA) |

However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving: dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous driving tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> | None |

MMD-OPT is based on embedding distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and the associated Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We show how these two concepts can be used to define a sample efficient surrogate for collision risk estimate. We perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of MMD-OPT on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Importantly, we show that trajectory optimization with our MMD-based collision risk surrogate leads to safer trajectories at low sample regimes than popular alternatives based on Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in 3D occupancy prediction have improved scene representation but often suffer from visual inconsistencies, leading to floating artifacts and poor surface localization. Existing voxel-wise losses (e.g., cross-entropy) fail to enforce visible geometric coherence. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a module that improves 3D occupancy learning by enforcing projective consistency. Our key idea is to project both predicted and ground-truth 3D occupancy into 2D camera views, where we apply supervision. Our method penalizes 3D configurations that produce inconsistent 2D projections, thereby enforcing a more coherent 3D structure. To achieve this efficiently, we leverage differentiable rendering with Gaussian splatting. GaussRender seamlessly integrates with existing architectures while maintaining efficiency and requiring no inference-time modifications. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate that GaussRender significantly improves geometric fidelity across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), achieving state-of-the-art results, particularly on surface-sensitive metrics such as RayIoU.

We present SeqGrowGraph, a novel framework that learns lane topology as a chain of graph expansions, inspired by human map-drawing processes. Representing the lane graph as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, with intersections ($V$) and centerlines ($E$), SeqGrowGraph incrementally constructs this graph by introducing one vertex at a time. At each step, an adjacency matrix ($A$) expands from $n \times n$ to $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ to encode connectivity, while a geometric matrix ($M$) captures centerline shapes as quadratic B\'ezier curves. The graph is serialized into sequences, enabling a transformer model to autoregressively predict the chain of expansions, guided by a depth-first search ordering. Evaluated on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, SeqGrowGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Due to the sparse points and noisy measurements of the 4D radar, most of the research finish the 3D object detection task by integrating images from camera and perform modality fusion in BEV space. However, the potential of the radar and the fusion mechanism is still largely unexplored, hindering the performance improvement. In this study, we propose a cross-view two-stage fusion network called CVFusion. In the first stage, we design a radar guided iterative (RGIter) BEV fusion module to generate high-recall 3D proposal boxes. In the second stage, we aggregate features from multiple heterogeneous views including points, image, and BEV for each proposal. These comprehensive instance level features greatly help refine the proposals and generate high-quality predictions. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with 9.10% and 3.68% mAP improvements on View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet, respectively.

| **[A Data-Driven Novelty Score for Diverse In-Vehicle Data Recording](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04529v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality datasets are essential for training robust perception systems in autonomous driving. However, real-world data collection is often biased toward common scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance hinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the curse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard logging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of redundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to biased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused on object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets. The method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel dynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and covariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those with redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training dataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher redundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more aggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random sampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and unpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment with 32 frames per second and is constant over time. By continuously updating the definition of normal content, it enables efficient detection of novelties in a continuous data stream.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted at the IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> | None |

Unlike traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process, facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.</p></details> | PRCV | None |

This issue underscores the importance of visual localization techniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes U-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to address these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using high-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first extracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we introduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors caused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided Registration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By effectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of association with the fine-grained precise localization capability of registration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple localization tasks. Furthermore, our model has undergone rigorous testing on large-scale autonomous driving fleets and has demonstrated stable performance in various challenging urban scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Visio...</summary><p>Vision Localization, Autonomous Driving, Bird's-Eye-View</p></details> | None |
| **[Learning collision risk proactively from naturalistic driving data at scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13556v3)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately and proactively alerting drivers or automated systems to emerging collisions is crucial for road safety, particularly in highly interactive and complex urban environments. However, existing approaches to identifying potential collisions either require labour-intensive annotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying contextual factors, or are only useful in specific scenarios. To address these limits, this study introduces the Generalised Surrogate Safety Measure (GSSM), a new data-driven approach that learns collision risk exclusively from naturalistic driving without the need for crash or risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the extent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards an unsafe state. Diverse data from naturalistic driving, including motion kinematics, weather, lighting, etc., are used to train multiple GSSMs, which are tested with 2,591 reconstructed real-world crashes and near-crashes. These test events are also released here as the largest dataset of its kind to date. A basic GSSM using only instantaneous motion kinematics achieves an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.9 and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential collisions. Additional interaction patterns and contextual factors provide further performance gains. Across various types of collision risk scenarios (such as rear-end, merging, and turning interactions), the accuracy and timeliness of GSSM consistently outperforms existing baselines. GSSM therefore establishes a scalable, context-aware, and generalisable foundation for proactively quantifying collision risk in traffic interactions. This can support and facilitate autonomous driving systems, traffic safety assessment, and road emergency management.

Trajectory refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement.

Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames, physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to 19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual understanding for autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike conventional approaches, EMC2 incorporates a scenario-aware MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition, EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices. Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes dataset, highlighting its capability to advance reliable, real-time 3D object detection tasks for AVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures | None |

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks. In comparison to existing models, VideoMolmo substantially improves spatio-temporal pointing accuracy and reasoning capability.

Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning for BEV tasks, as pivotal for real-world applications, underperform due to the homogeneous distribution of the labeled data. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance the diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our preliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises efficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data from world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning framework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry Consistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance capability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from the alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and the mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel Prediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model, where the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of multinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts semantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to realize uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Local Semantic Exclusion (HLSE) module is designed to address the non-mutual exclusivity inherent in BEV semantic segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that NRSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest improvements in mIoU of 13.8% and 11.4% in unsupervised and semi-supervised BEV segmentation tasks, respectively.

We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Technical report | None |
| **[Zero Memory Overhead Approach for Protecting Vision Transformer Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03816v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance over Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various vision-related tasks such as classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their use of self-attention mechanisms. As ViTs become more popular in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, ensuring their correct functionality becomes essential, especially in the presence of bit-flip faults in their parameters stored in memory. In this paper, a fault tolerance technique is introduced to protect ViT parameters against bit-flip faults with zero memory overhead. Since the least significant bits of parameters are not critical for model accuracy, replacing the LSB with a parity bit provides an error detection mechanism without imposing any overhead on the model. When faults are detected, affected parameters are masked by zeroing out, as most parameters in ViT models are near zero, effectively preventing accuracy degradation. This approach enhances reliability across ViT models, improving the robustness of parameters to bit-flips by up to three orders of magnitude, making it an effective zero-overhead solution for fault tolerance in critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

SEAL introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability.

These attacks exploit the underlying neural network, allowing small -- nearly invisible -- perturbations to completely alter the behavior of such systems in potentially malicious ways. E.g., causing a traffic sign classification network to misclassify a stop sign as a speed limit sign. Prior working in hardening such systems to adversarial attacks have looked at robust training of the system or adding additional pre-processing steps to the input pipeline. Such solutions either have a hard time generalizing, require knowledge of the adversarial attacks during training, or are computationally undesirable. Instead, we propose to take insights for parameter efficient fine-tuning and use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to train a lightweight security patch -- enabling us to dynamically patch a large preexisting vision system as new vulnerabilities are discovered. We demonstrate that our framework can patch a pre-trained model to improve classification accuracy by up to 78.01% in the presence of adversarial examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated pre-print.

This enhances task effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics, teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable. To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66 participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |
| **[A Late Collaborative Perception Framework for 3D Multi-Object and Multi-Source Association and Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02430v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy, they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position, and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges, setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.</p></details> |  | None |

Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected, but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments. This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany. The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at: https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of security-related scenarios in the communications sector.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE IAVVC 2025 Conference</p></details> | None |

Addressing these two tasks with separate networks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision algorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and embodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them within a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing between the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in comprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a tightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep supervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined use of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art joint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and stereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2 datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in mIoU by over 9%.

In this work, we reframe 3D occupancy prediction as a generative modeling task using diffusion models, which learn the underlying data distribution and incorporate 3D scene priors. This approach enhances prediction consistency, noise robustness, and better handles the intricacies of 3D spatial structures. Our extensive experiments show that diffusion-based generative models outperform state-of-the-art discriminative approaches, delivering more realistic and accurate occupancy predictions, especially in occluded or low-visibility regions. Moreover, the improved predictions significantly benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our method for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 | None |

However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need additional data and significant computational resources. To address these issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame 3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally, we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.</p></details> |  | None |

In this context, connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency. Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model, formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players. The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we provide perspectives on various aspects within the context of developing digital twins for CPSs, where foundation models can be used to increase the efficiency of creating digital twins, improve the effectiveness of the capabilities they provide, and used as specialized fine-tuned foundation models acting as digital twins themselves. We also discuss challenges in using foundation models in a more generic context. We use the case of an autonomous driving system as a representative CPS to give examples. Finally, we provide discussions and open research directions that we believe are valuable for the digital twin community.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.</p></details> |  | None |

While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes dataset.

Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA.

Most of the current designs of motion prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines, which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents. Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while achieving improved performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins.

We propose RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1) Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2) probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3) real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously.

This paper presents SafeMap, a novel framework specifically designed to secure accuracy even when certain camera views are missing. SafeMap integrates two key components: the Gaussian-based Perspective View Reconstruction (G-PVR) module and the Distillation-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) Correction (D-BEVC) module. G-PVR leverages prior knowledge of view importance to dynamically prioritize the most informative regions based on the relationships among available camera views. Furthermore, D-BEVC utilizes panoramic BEV features to correct the BEV representations derived from incomplete observations. Together, these components facilitate the end-to-end map reconstruction and robust HD map generation.

This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4% mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, we argue that a structured representation is crucial for scene generation, especially for autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes BEV-VAE for consistent and controllable view synthesis. BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image variational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then generates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports arbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D layouts.

A critical research challenge arises: constructing an informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free, end-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present World4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision foundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating multi-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts scene features, including driving intention and world latent representations enriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It then generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene features and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future states within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector module to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception annotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between actual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the latent space. World4Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual perception annotations on both the open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim benchmarks, demonstrating an 18.1\% relative reduction in L2 error, 46.7% lower collision rate, and 3.75 faster training convergence.

Machine learning methods for object recognition often assume that all object categories encountered during inference belong to a closed set of classes present in the training data. This assumption limits generalization to the real world, as objects not seen during training may be misclassified or entirely ignored. As part of reliable AI, OOD detection identifies inputs that deviate significantly from the training distribution.

Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3) spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate effectively with users under real-world conditions.

However, existing methods struggle to comprehensively address the autonomy-oriented requirements of balancing: (i) dynamical fidelity, (ii) photorealistic rendering, (iii) context-relevant scenario orchestration, and (iv) real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present a unified framework for creating and curating high-fidelity digital twins to accelerate advancements in autonomous driving research. Our framework leverages a mix of physics-based and data-driven techniques for developing and simulating digital twins of autonomous vehicles and their operating environments. It is capable of reconstructing real-world scenes and assets (real2sim) with geometric and photorealistic accuracy and infusing them with various physical properties to enable real-time dynamical simulation of the ensuing driving scenarios. Additionally, it also incorporates a large language model (LLM) interface to flexibly edit the driving scenarios online via natural language prompts. We analyze the presented framework in terms of its fidelity, performance, and serviceability. Results indicate that our framework can reconstruct 3D scenes and assets with up to 97% structural similarity, while maintaining frame rates above 60 Hz. We also demonstrate that it can handle natural language prompts to generate diverse driving scenarios with up to 95% repeatability and 85% generalizability.</p></details> |  | None |

Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful transition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real transfer methods struggle to comprehensively address the autonomy-oriented requirements of balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust performance with limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain representations, and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain points, we present a unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive representations for sim2real transferable autonomous driving algorithms using conditional latent diffusion models. Our framework offers options to leverage: (i) alternate foundation models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and (iii) textual as well as image prompts for mapping across given source and target domains. It is also capable of generating diverse high-quality samples when diffusing across parameter spaces such as times of day, weather conditions, seasons, and operational design domains. We systematically analyze the presented framework and report our findings in the form of critical quantitative metrics and ablation studies, as well as insightful qualitative examples and remarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the serviceability of the proposed approach in bridging the sim2real gap for end-to-end autonomous driving using a behavioral cloning case study. Our experiments indicate that the proposed framework is capable of bridging the perceptual sim2real gap by over 40%. We hope that our approach underscores the potential of generative diffusion models in sim2real transfer, offering a pathway toward more robust and adaptive autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Rethink 3D Object Detection from Physical World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00190v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-accuracy and low-latency 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving systems. While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate performance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at 100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs between different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite being critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the impact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading to safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In this paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP) as new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time and physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for real-time 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics for the entire autonomous driving system using nuPlan dataset, and evaluate 3D object detection models accounting for hardware differences and accelerators. We also develop a state-of-the-art performance model for real-time 3D object detection through latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) using our metrics. Additionally, we quantitatively demonstrate that the assumption "the more point clouds, the better the recognition performance" is incorrect for real-time applications and optimize both hardware and model selection using our metrics.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures | None |
| **[Information Entropy Guided Height-aware Histogram for Quantization-friendly Pillar Feature Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18734v6)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time and high-performance 3D object detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete distribution of points at different heights within one pillar with the information entropy guidance. This simple yet effective design greatly preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PillarHist in terms of both efficiency and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need further revision</p></details> | None |
| **[Epona: Autoregressive Diffusion World Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24113v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling. However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks.

Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we detail open challenges - robustness, real-time efficiency, and formal verification - and outline future directions of VLA4AD. This survey provides a concise yet complete reference for advancing interpretable socially aligned autonomous vehicles.

Modeling the environment risk information by field is a promising and effective approach for safe trajectory planning. However, existing risk assessment theories only analyze the risk by current information, ignoring future prediction. This paper proposes a predictive risk analysis and safe trajectory planning framework for intelligent and connected vehicles. This framework first predicts future trajectories of objects by a local risk-aware algorithm, following with a spatiotemporal-discretised predictive risk analysis using the prediction results. Then the safe trajectory is generated based on the predictive risk analysis. Finally, simulation and vehicle experiments confirm the efficacy and real-time practicability of our approach.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[STCLocker: Deadlock Avoidance Testing for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23995v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures. Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique, STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA, a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing baseline.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[StyleDrive: Towards Driving-Style Aware Benchmarking of End-To-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23982v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics. To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems, catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[ADReFT: Adaptive Decision Repair for Safe Autonomous Driving via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23960v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) continue to face safety-critical risks due to the inherent limitations in their design and performance capabilities. Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety. Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background editing and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we introduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a single pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather effects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View (TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal and spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and multi-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a 3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field to generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and dynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based modelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and flexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with the 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects. Experiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can generate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity, highlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse weather.

Recent advancements in efficient point cloud transformers have underscored the efficacy of integrating information in sparse formats. When it comes to fusion, since image patches are dense in pixel space with ambiguous depth, it necessitates additional design considerations for effective fusion. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of design choices for Transformer-based sparse cameraLiDAR fusion. This investigation encompasses strategies for image-to-3D and LiDAR-to-2D mapping, attention neighbor grouping, single modal tokenizer, and micro-structure of Transformer. By amalgamating the most effective principles uncovered through our investigation, we introduce FlatFusion, a carefully designed framework for sparse camera-LiDAR fusion. Notably, FlatFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse Transformer-based methods, including UniTR, CMT, and SparseFusion, achieving 73.7 NDS on the nuScenes validation set with 10.1 FPS with PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |

However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore, we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action consistency and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> | None |

Existing methods focus on the integration of diverse generative information into controlling inputs, utilizing frameworks such as GLIGEN or ControlNet, to produce commendable outcomes in controllable generation. However, such approaches intrinsically restrict generation performance to the learning capacities of predefined network architectures. In this paper, we explore the innovative integration of controlling information and introduce PerLDiff (\textbf{Per}spective-\textbf{L}ayout \textbf{Diff}usion Models), a novel method for effective street view image generation that fully leverages perspective 3D geometric information. Our PerLDiff employs 3D geometric priors to guide the generation of street view images with precise object-level control within the network learning process, resulting in a more robust and controllable output. Moreover, it demonstrates superior controllability compared to alternative layout control methods. Empirical results justify that our PerLDiff markedly enhances the precision of controllable generation on the NuScenes and KITTI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation. However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields (OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention (HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark.

To overcome this limitation, incorporating temporal data such as past image frames or steering sequences, has proven effective in enhancing robustness and adaptability in challenging scenarios. While previous high-performance methods exist, they often rely on resource-intensive fusion networks, making them impractical for training and unsuitable for federated learning. To address these challenges, we propose lightweight temporal transformer decomposition, a method that processes sequential image frames and temporal steering data by breaking down large attention maps into smaller matrices. This approach reduces model complexity, enabling efficient weight updates for convergence and real-time predictions while leveraging temporal information to enhance autonomous driving performance. Intensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms recent approaches by a clear margin while achieving real-time performance.

In such environments, frequent pedestrian avoidance maneuvers may cause rapid steering adjustments and passive postural responses from passengers, thereby increasing the risk of motion sickness. This study investigated the effects of providing path information on 16 passengers' head movement behavior and motion sickness while riding an APMV. Through a controlled experiment comparing manual driving (MD), autonomous driving without path information (AD w/o path), and autonomous driving with path information (AD w/ path), we found that providing path cues significantly reduced MISC scores and delayed the onset of motion sickness symptoms. In addition, participants were more likely to proactively align their head movements with the direction of vehicle rotation in both MD and AD w/ path conditions. Although a small correlation was observed between the delay in yaw rotation of the passenger's head relative to the vehicle and the occurrence of motion sickness, the underlying physiological mechanism remains to be elucidated.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern automatic solutions are limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework, specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print (submitted to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing)</p></details> | None |

However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components: layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods struggle with low-light conditions due to issues like indistinct small-object features, limited feature interaction, and poor image quality, which degrade detection accuracy and speed. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. YOLO-LLTS introduces three main contributions: the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-SOD) module to enhance small-object detection by mitigating feature dilution; the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module to improve information extraction through multi-scale features interaction; and the Prior-Guided Feature Enhancement Module (PGFE) to enhance image quality by addressing noise, low contrast, and blurriness. Additionally, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, 7.5% mAP50 and 9.8% mAP50:95 on GTSDB-night, and superior results on CCTSDB2021.

| **[InfGen: Scenario Generation as Next Token Group Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23316v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic and interactive traffic simulation is essential for training and evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most existing data-driven simulation methods rely on static initialization or log-replay data, limiting their ability to model dynamic, long-horizon scenarios with evolving agent populations. We propose InfGen, a scenario generation framework that outputs agent states and trajectories in an autoregressive manner. InfGen represents the entire scene as a sequence of tokens, including traffic light signals, agent states, and motion vectors, and uses a transformer model to simulate traffic over time. This design enables InfGen to continuously insert new agents into traffic, supporting infinite scene generation. Experiments demonstrate that InfGen produces realistic, diverse, and adaptive traffic behaviors. Furthermore, reinforcement learning policies trained in InfGen-generated scenarios achieve superior robustness and generalization, validating its utility as a high-fidelity simulation environment for autonomous driving.

| **[Mode Collapse Happens: Evaluating Critical Interactions in Joint Trajectory Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23164v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicle decisions rely on multimodal prediction models that account for multiple route options and the inherent uncertainty in human behavior. However, models can suffer from mode collapse, where only the most likely mode is predicted, posing significant safety risks. While existing methods employ various strategies to generate diverse predictions, they often overlook the diversity in interaction modes among agents. Additionally, traditional metrics for evaluating prediction models are dataset-dependent and do not evaluate inter-agent interactions quantitatively. To our knowledge, none of the existing metrics explicitly evaluates mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that assesses mode collapse in joint trajectory predictions, focusing on safety-critical interactions. We introduce metrics for mode collapse, mode correctness, and coverage, emphasizing the sequential dimension of predictions. By testing four multi-agent trajectory prediction models, we demonstrate that mode collapse indeed happens. When looking at the sequential dimension, although prediction accuracy improves closer to interaction events, there are still cases where the models are unable to predict the correct interaction mode, even just before the interaction mode becomes inevitable. We hope that our framework can help researchers gain new insights and advance the development of more consistent and accurate prediction models, thus enhancing the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to a journal</p></details> | None |

Existing methods primarily predict where drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the cognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which limits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we introduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that jointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics (what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To support this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver attention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and causal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal conditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further propose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention prediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive reasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets and driving conditions. This work serves as a key step toward a deeper understanding of driver attention mechanisms, with significant implications for autonomous driving, intelligent driver training, and human-computer interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Structure-Aware Radar-Camera Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05008v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar has gained much attention in autonomous driving due to its accessibility and robustness. However, its standalone application for depth perception is constrained by issues of sparsity and noise. Radar-camera depth estimation offers a more promising complementary solution. Despite significant progress, current approaches fail to produce satisfactory dense depth maps, due to the unsatisfactory processing of the sparse and noisy radar data. They constrain the regions of interest for radar points in rigid rectangular regions, which may introduce unexpected errors and confusions. To address these issues, we develop a structure-aware strategy for radar depth enhancement, which provides more targeted regions of interest by leveraging the structural priors of RGB images. Furthermore, we design a Multi-Scale Structure Guided Network to enhance radar features and preserve detailed structures, achieving accurate and structure-detailed dense metric depth estimation. Building on these, we propose a structure-aware radar-camera depth estimation framework, named SA-RCD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SA-RCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset.

However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures.

This study explores an anomaly detection approach by simulating vehicle behavior, generating a dataset that represents typical and atypical vehicular interactions. The dataset includes time-series data of position, speed, and acceleration for multiple connected autonomous vehicles. We utilized machine learning models to effectively identify abnormal driving patterns. First, we applied a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture temporal dependencies and sequence-based anomalies. The stacked LSTM model processed the sequential data to learn standard driving behaviors. Additionally, we deployed a Random Forest model to support anomaly detection by offering ensemble-based predictions, which enhanced model interpretability and performance. The Random Forest model achieved an R2 of 0.9830, MAE of 5.746, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 14.18, while the stacked LSTM model attained an R2 of 0.9998, MAE of 82.425, and a 95th percentile anomaly threshold of 265.63. These results demonstrate the models' effectiveness in accurately predicting vehicle trajectories and detecting anomalies in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Unlike traditional 2D media, point clouds present unique challenges due to their irregular structure, high data volume, and complex attributes. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances in point cloud compression (PCC) and point cloud quality assessment (PCQA), emphasizing their significance for real-time and perceptually relevant applications. We analyze a wide range of handcrafted and learning-based PCC algorithms, along with objective PCQA metrics. By benchmarking representative methods on emerging datasets, we offer detailed comparisons and practical insights into their strengths and limitations. Despite notable progress, challenges such as enhancing visual fidelity, reducing latency, and supporting multimodal data remain. This survey outlines future directions, including hybrid compression frameworks and advanced feature extraction strategies, to enable more efficient, immersive, and intelligent 3D applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

However, most existing methods lack generalization and are limited to specific tasks such as image recovery. To address these issues, we propose Gated-Mechanism Mixture-of-Experts (GM-MoE), the first framework to introduce a mixture-of-experts network for low-light image enhancement. GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MoE achieves superior generalization with respect to 25 compared approaches, reaching state-of-the-art performance on PSNR on 5 benchmarks and SSIM on 4 benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Single-Frame Point-Pixel Registration via Supervised Cross-Modal Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22784v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point-pixel registration between LiDAR point clouds and camera images is a fundamental yet challenging task in autonomous driving and robotic perception. A key difficulty lies in the modality gap between unstructured point clouds and structured images, especially under sparse single-frame LiDAR settings. Existing methods typically extract features separately from point clouds and images, then rely on hand-crafted or learned matching strategies. This separate encoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically, these methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often requiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability. Inspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g. MatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the detector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and camera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view from the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free matching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without relying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability, we introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility prior. This guides the network to suppress unreliable matches in regions with low intensity variation, improving robustness under sparse input. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and MIAS-LCEC-TF70 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches on nuScenes (even those relying on accumulated point clouds), despite using only single-frame LiDAR.</p></details> |  | None |

The growing interest in this challenge highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to $\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets. Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust models.

Most existing methods rely on object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting (B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling, automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.

However, the data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology</p></details> | None |

However, existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems predominantly rely on single-modal sensors as primary participants, which leads to a limited representation of environmental features and significant performance bottlenecks under the emerging requirements of 6G applications. This limitation motivates a paradigm shift from single-modal to multimodal ISAC. In this article, we first analyze the key challenges in realizing multimodal ISAC, including the fusion of heterogeneous multimodal data, the high communication overhead among distributed sensors, and the design of efficient and scalable system architectures. We then introduce several enabling technologies, such as large AI models, semantic communication, and multi-agent systems, that hold promise for addressing these challenges. To operationalize these technologies, we zoom into three architectural paradigms: fusion-based multimodal ISAC (F-MAC), interaction-based multimodal ISAC (I-MAC), and relay-based multimodal ISAC (R-MAC), each tailored to organize devices and modalities for efficient collaboration in different scenarios. Thereafter, a case study is presented based on the F-MAC scheme, demonstrating that the scheme achieves more comprehensive sensing and improves sensing accuracy by approximately 80% compared to conventional single-modal ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss several open issues to be addressed in the future.</p></details> |  | None |

Researchers are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed. By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes, simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images significantly improve downstream perception models performance.

Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> | None |

To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space.

In this paper, we propose a BEV-based 3D Object Detection Network with 2D Region-Oriented Attention (ROA-BEV), which enables the backbone to focus more on feature learning of the regions where objects exist. Moreover, our method further enhances the information feature learning ability of ROA through multi-scale structures. Each block of ROA utilizes a large kernel to ensure that the receptive field is large enough to catch information about large objects. Experiments on nuScenes show that ROA-BEV improves the performance based on BEVDepth.

Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse & nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> | None |

This issue becomes more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

While existing vision-language models perform well in general tasks, they encounter difficulties in understanding complex, multi-object environments, particularly in real-time applications such as autonomous driving, where the rapid identification of key objects is crucial. To address this limitation, an Attention Map Generator is proposed to highlight significant objects relevant to driving decisions within critical video frames. By directing the model's focus to these key regions, the generated attention map helps produce clear and relevant explanations, enabling drivers to better understand the vehicle's decision-making process in critical situations. Evaluations on the DRAMA dataset reveal significant improvements in explanation quality, as indicated by higher BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and SPICE scores compared to baseline models. These findings underscore the potential of targeted attention mechanisms in vision-language models for enhancing explainability in real-time autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025. 7 pages, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It creates a feedback loop where the agent's performance influences the generation of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent. However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how can we train an adversarial cooperator? We propose a novel strategy that combines a pretrained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies where the learning policy, the Cooperator agent, underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state of the art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.</p></details> |  | None |

Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding. Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1) Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely artificial training.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Leveraging Correlation Across Test Platforms for Variance-Reduced Metric Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20553v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based robotic systems demand rigorous validation to assure reliable performance, but extensive real-world testing is often prohibitively expensive, and if conducted may still yield insufficient data for high-confidence guarantees. In this work, we introduce a general estimation framework that leverages paired data across test platforms, e.g., paired simulation and real-world observations, to achieve better estimates of real-world metrics via the method of control variates. By incorporating cheap and abundant auxiliary measurements (for example, simulator outputs) as control variates for costly real-world samples, our method provably reduces the variance of Monte Carlo estimates and thus requires significantly fewer real-world samples to attain a specified confidence bound on the mean performance. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing the variance and sample-efficiency improvement, and demonstrate empirically in autonomous driving and quadruped robotics settings that our approach achieves high-probability bounds with markedly improved sample efficiency. Our technique can lower the real-world testing burden for validating the performance of the stack, thereby enabling more efficient and cost-effective experimental evaluation of robotic systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions, and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally, we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ECMR 2025</p></details> | None |

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making. However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior. Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under-review conference</p></details> | None |

While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  | None |

Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects.

However, these algorithms sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation, especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based confidence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at ICANN 2025 (International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks) and will appear in the conference proceedings published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

However, previous approaches predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training, UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous driving.</p></details> | technical report | None |

Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for real-world applications such as autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

It jointly learns the implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs, our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera domain.

We present AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side Units (RSUs).

However, the behaviors of NPC vehicles in these scenarios generated by previous approaches are predefined and mutated before simulation execution, ignoring traffic signals and the behaviors of the Ego vehicle. Thus, a large number of the violations they found are induced by unrealistic behaviors of NPC vehicles, revealing no bugs of ADSs. Besides, the vast scenario search space of NPC behaviors during the iterative mutations limits the efficiency of previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a novel scenario-based testing framework, DynNPC, to generate more violation scenarios induced by the ADS. Specifically, DynNPC allows NPC vehicles to dynamically generate behaviors using different driving strategies during simulation execution based on traffic signals and the real-time behavior of the Ego vehicle. We compare DynNPC with five state-of-the-art scenario-based testing approaches. Our evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of DynNPC in finding more violation scenarios induced by the ADS.</p></details> |  | None |

While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing methods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world perturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work first identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA robustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in shared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by domain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address the proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a robustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial attack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention alignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving discriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that progressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on SynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of 14.3\% under adversarial attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> | None |

Despite advancements, current models often struggle with segmenting densely packed elements due to a lack of comprehensive fusion features for guidance during training. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) allows precise control during fine-tuning through its flexible prompting encoder, its potential remains largely unexplored in the context of multimodal segmentation for natural images. In this paper, we introduce SAM into multimodal image segmentation for the first time, proposing a novel framework that combines Latent Space Token Generation (LSTG) and Fusion Mask Prompting (FMP) modules. This approach transforms the training methodology for multimodal segmentation from a traditional black-box approach to a controllable, prompt-based mechanism. Specifically, we obtain latent space features for both modalities through vector quantization and embed them into a cross-attention-based inter-domain fusion module to establish long-range dependencies between modalities. We then use these comprehensive fusion features as prompts to guide precise pixel-level segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SAM and SAM2 in multimodal autonomous driving scenarios, achieving an average improvement of 4.1$\%$ over the state-of-the-art method in segmentation mIoU, and the performance is also optimized in other multi-modal visual scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing models assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution (LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal, restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions. Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical.

To overcome these issues, the task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However, conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP (OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all categories on SemanticKITTI.</p></details> | under review | None |

However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.</p></details> | under reviewed | None |

Our Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), equipped with a 4D radar, a monocular camera, a GPS, and an IMU, delivers robust tracking capabilities in complex waterborne environments. By leveraging these sensors, our USV collected comprehensive object tracking data, which we present as USVTrack, the first 4D radar-camera tracking dataset tailored for autonomous driving in new generation waterborne transportation systems. Our USVTrack dataset presents rich scenarios, featuring diverse various waterways, varying times of day, and multiple weather and lighting conditions. Moreover, we present a simple but effective radar-camera matching method, termed RCM, which can be plugged into popular two-stage association trackers. Experimental results utilizing RCM demonstrate the effectiveness of the radar-camera matching in improving object tracking accuracy and reliability for autonomous driving in waterborne environments.

| **[TDACloud: Point Cloud Recognition Using Topological Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18725v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford RobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for object and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and transformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated, or rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy conditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the baselines by up to approximately 14%.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Scale Spectral Attention Module-based Hyperspectral Segmentation in Autonomous Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18682v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82% GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets. Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

An intriguing challenge arises when agents interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users: supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint version; 23 pages (including references and appendix)</p></details> | None |

However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks, yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Drive-R1: Bridging Reasoning and Planning in VLMs for Autonomous Driving with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18234v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and (2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1 designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1 first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future research and applications.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Bayesian Multiobject Tracking With Neural-Enhanced Motion and Measurement Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18124v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so, the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved. To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UniDrive: Towards Universal Driving Perception Across Camera Configurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13864v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-centric autonomous driving has demonstrated excellent performance with economical sensors. As the fundamental step, 3D perception aims to infer 3D information from 2D images based on 3D-2D projection. This makes driving perception models susceptible to sensor configuration (e.g., camera intrinsics and extrinsics) variations. However, generalizing across camera configurations is important for deploying autonomous driving models on different car models. In this paper, we present UniDrive, a novel framework for vision-centric autonomous driving to achieve universal perception across camera configurations. We deploy a set of unified virtual cameras and propose a ground-aware projection method to effectively transform the original images into these unified virtual views. We further propose a virtual configuration optimization method by minimizing the expected projection error between original and virtual cameras. The proposed virtual camera projection can be applied to existing 3D perception methods as a plug-and-play module to mitigate the challenges posed by camera parameter variability, resulting in more adaptable and reliable driving perception models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we collect a dataset on CARLA by driving the same routes while only modifying the camera configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method trained on one specific camera configuration can generalize to varying configurations with minor performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; 15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables; Code at https://github.com/ywyeli/UniDrive</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/ywyeli/UniDrive) |

While LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception. However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and 88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 30.02 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[Training A Neural Network For Partially Occluded Road Sign Identification In The Context Of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18177v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing number of autonomous vehicles and the rapid development of computer vision technologies underscore the particular importance of conducting research on the accuracy of traffic sign recognition. Numerous studies in this field have already achieved significant results, demonstrating high effectiveness in addressing traffic sign recognition tasks. However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.</p></details> |  | None |

To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[May the Feedback Be with You! Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17642v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) Infrastructures, represented by Deep Learning (DL) frameworks, have served as fundamental DL systems over the last decade. However, the bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in some critical scenarios (e.g., healthcare and autonomous driving). A simple yet effective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing). Unfortunately, existing fuzzing techniques have not comprehensively considered multiple types of feedback. Additionally, they analyze feedback in a coarse-grained manner, such as mutating the test cases only according to whether the coverage increases. Recently, researchers introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into fuzzing. However, current LLM-based fuzzing techniques only focus on using LLMs to generate test cases while overlooking their potential to analyze feedback information, failing to create more valid and diverse test cases. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to break the seal of Feedback-driven fuzzing for DL frameworks. The backbone of FUEL comprises two LLM-based agents, namely analysis LLM and generation LLM. Analysis LLM agent infers analysis summaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM agent creates tests guided by these analysis summaries. So far, FUEL has detected 104 bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 47 already fixed, and 5 assigned with CVE IDs. Our work indicates that considering multiple types of feedback is beneficial to fuzzing performance, and leveraging LLMs to analyze feedback information is a promising direction.

However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details, supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects. Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results and accurate surface from full-size image optimization.

| **[Optimization-Free Patch Attack on Stereo Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17632v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints? To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency, reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability. Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to disrupt SDE assumptions. We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4), whereas optimization-based methods fail.</p></details> |  | None |

While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, Preprint under review.

The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.
