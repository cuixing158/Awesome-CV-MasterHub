In this paper, we introduce 4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread. The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate 4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex scenes.</p></details> |  | None |

This could revolutionize applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. However, before treating these models as world models, we must ask: Do they adhere to physical conservation laws? To answer this, we introduce Morpheus, a benchmark for evaluating video generation models on physical reasoning. It features 80 real-world videos capturing physical phenomena, guided by conservation laws. Since artificial generations lack ground truth, we assess physical plausibility using physics-informed metrics evaluated with respect to infallible conservation laws known per physical setting, leveraging advances in physics-informed neural networks and vision-language foundation models. Our findings reveal that even with advanced prompting and video conditioning, current models struggle to encode physical principles despite generating aesthetically pleasing videos. All data, leaderboard, and code are open-sourced at our project page.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Enhanced Motion Forecasting with Plug-and-Play Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17274v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance, while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across both benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of IROS 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Explainability of Large Language Models: Opportunities and Challenges toward Generating Trustworthy Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17256v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions. First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities, critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned, trustworthy LLM explanations.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing end-to-end methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[DiffVLA++: Bridging Cognitive Reasoning and End-to-End Driving through Metric-Guided Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17148v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional end-to-end (E2E) driving models are effective at generating physically plausible trajectories, but often fail to generalize to long-tail scenarios due to the lack of essential world knowledge to understand and reason about surrounding environments. In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited 3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ProDAT: Progressive Density-Aware Tail-Drop for Point Cloud Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17068v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding, which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UNDREAM: Bridging Differentiable Rendering and Photorealistic Simulation for End-to-end Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16923v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models deployed in safety critical applications like autonomous driving use simulations to test their robustness against adversarial attacks in realistic conditions. However, these simulations are non-differentiable, forcing researchers to create attacks that do not integrate simulation environmental factors, reducing attack success. To address this limitation, we introduce UNDREAM, the first software framework that bridges the gap between photorealistic simulators and differentiable renderers to enable end-to-end optimization of adversarial perturbations on any 3D objects. UNDREAM enables manipulation of the environment by offering complete control over weather, lighting, backgrounds, camera angles, trajectories, and realistic human and object movements, thereby allowing the creation of diverse scenes. We showcase a wide array of distinct physically plausible adversarial objects that UNDREAM enables researchers to swiftly explore in different configurable environments. This combination of photorealistic simulation and differentiable optimization opens new avenues for advancing research of physical adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Unsupervised Monocular Road Segmentation for Autonomous Driving via Scene Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16790v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures | None |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on World Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16732v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2) Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges, including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated bibliography at https://github.com/Li-Zn-H/AwesomeWorldModels.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Li-Zn-H/AwesomeWorldModels</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/Li-Zn-H/AwesomeWorldModels) |
| **[Vision-Centric 4D Occupancy Forecasting and Planning via Implicit Residual World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16729v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[FIRE: A Failure-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Computing Migrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14399v4)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In edge computing, users' service profiles are migrated due to user mobility. Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances. Through trace driven experiments, we show that FIRE reduces costs compared to vanilla RL and the greedy baseline in the event of failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Services Computing</p></details> | None |

To bridge this gap, we present ORAD-3D, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest dataset specifically curated for off-road autonomous driving. ORAD-3D covers a wide spectrum of terrains, including woodlands, farmlands, grasslands, riversides, gravel roads, cement roads, and rural areas, while capturing diverse environmental variations across weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, and snowy) and illumination levels (bright daylight, daytime, twilight, and nighttime). Building upon this dataset, we establish a comprehensive suite of benchmark evaluations spanning five fundamental tasks: 2D free-space detection, 3D occupancy prediction, rough GPS-guided path planning, vision-language model-driven autonomous driving, and world model for off-road environments. Together, the dataset and benchmarks provide a unified and robust resource for advancing perception and planning in challenging off-road scenarios. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/chaytonmin/ORAD-3D.</p></details> | Off-road robotics | [Code Link](https://github.com/chaytonmin/ORAD-3D) |
| **[Enhancing Rotated Object Detection via Anisotropic Gaussian Bounding Box and Bhattacharyya Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16445v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition, we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.</p></details> | Neurocomputing | None |
| **[Interpretable Decision-Making for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18898v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ICCV 2025 2nd Workshop on the Challenge Of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (2COOOL)</p></details> | None |
| **[ObjectTransforms for Uncertainty Quantification and Reduction in Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16118v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object detection through object specific transformations at both training and inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic, diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and inference respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025 Workshops</p></details> | None |

Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

| **[Perfect Prediction or Plenty of Proposals? What Matters Most in Planning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15505v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures | None |
| **[VDRive: Leveraging Reinforced VLA and Diffusion Policy for End-to-end Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15446v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</p></details> | 1st version | None |
| **[FreqPDE: Rethinking Positional Depth Embedding for Multi-View 3D Object Detection Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15385v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism. Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and 3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 | None |

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and overcoming occlusions, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous driving. In recent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged; however, these datasets primarily focus on cameras and LiDAR, neglecting 4D Radar, a sensor used in single-vehicle autonomous driving to provide robust perception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap created by the absence of 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we present V2X-Radar, the first large-scale, real-world multi-modal dataset featuring 4D Radar. V2X-Radar dataset is collected using a connected vehicle platform and an intelligent roadside unit equipped with 4D Radar, LiDAR, and multi-view cameras. The collected data encompasses sunny and rainy weather conditions, spanning daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as various typical challenging scenarios. The dataset consists of 20K LiDAR frames, 40K camera images, and 20K 4D Radar data, including 350K annotated boxes across five categories. To support various research domains, we have established V2X-Radar-C for cooperative perception, V2X-Radar-I for roadside perception, and V2X-Radar-V for single-vehicle perception. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive benchmarks across these three sub-datasets. We will release all datasets and benchmark codebase at http://openmpd.com/column/V2X-Radar and https://github.com/yanglei18/V2X-Radar.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/yanglei18/V2X-Radar) |

LiDAR-generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's-eye view for the scene representation, enabling self-supervised joint scene predictions while exhibiting resilience to partial observability and perception detection failures. Prior approaches have focused on deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures within the grid cell space. While these methods have seen some success, they frequently produce unrealistic predictions and fail to capture the stochastic nature of the environment. Additionally, they do not effectively integrate additional sensor modalities present in AVs. Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction (LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a generative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and planned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder, which provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based batch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal consistency issues and reduce compression losses. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets show that all variants of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperform prior approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[FASTopoWM: Fast-Slow Lane Segment Topology Reasoning with Latent World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23325v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV) road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[TopoStreamer: Temporal Lane Segment Topology Reasoning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00709v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Scenic, a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs) suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14 prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics (compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11). EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88 percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting, Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options for autonomous-driving scenario programming.</p></details> |  | None |

In order to improve the robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial attack, such as state observation attacks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[RelTopo: Multi-Level Relational Modeling for Driving Scene Topology Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13553v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student, and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> | None |

These large-scale datasets are often dominated by common environmental conditions such as "Clear and Day" weather, leading to decreased performance in under-represented conditions like "Rainy and Night". To address this issue, we introduce SynDiff-AD, a novel data augmentation pipeline that leverages diffusion models (DMs) to generate realistic images for such subgroups. SynDiff-AD uses ControlNet-a DM that guides data generation conditioned on semantic maps-along with a novel prompting scheme that generates subgroup-specific, semantically dense prompts. By augmenting datasets with SynDiff-AD, we improve the performance of segmentation models like Mask2Former and SegFormer by up to 1.2% and 2.3% on the Waymo dataset, and up to 1.4% and 0.7% on the DeepDrive dataset, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that our SynDiff-AD pipeline enhances the driving performance of end-to-end autonomous driving models, like AIM-2D and AIM-BEV, by up to 20% across diverse environmental conditions in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, providing a more robust model. We release our code and pipeline at https://github.com/UTAustin-SwarmLab/SynDiff-AD.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/UTAustin-SwarmLab/SynDiff-AD) |

Nevertheless, most methods often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively. Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios. The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation (DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI) loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> | None |

To address this, we propose the Hints of Prompt (HoP) framework, which introduces three key enhancements: Affinity hint to emphasize instance-level structure by strengthening token-wise connections, Semantic hint to incorporate high-level information relevant to driving-specific cases, such as complex interactions among vehicles and traffic signs, and Question hint to align visual features with the query context, focusing on question-relevant regions. These hints are fused through a Hint Fusion module, enriching visual representations by capturing driving-related representations with limited domain data, ensuring faster adaptation to driving scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the HoP framework, showing that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in all key metrics.</p></details> |  | None |

Their acceleration features, such as caches and pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.</p></details> |  | None |

However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack (SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance. We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper introduces Hi-Drive, a hierarchical planning algorithm addressing uncertainties at both behavior and trajectory levels using a hierarchical Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation. Hi-Drive employs driver models to represent uncertain behavioral intentions of other vehicles and uses their parameters to infer hidden driving styles. By treating driver models as high-level decision-making actions, our approach effectively manages the exponential complexity inherent in POMDPs. To further enhance safety and robustness, Hi-Drive integrates a trajectory optimization based on importance sampling, refining trajectories using a comprehensive analysis of critical agents. Evaluations on real-world urban driving datasets demonstrate that Hi-Drive significantly outperforms state-of-the-art planning-based and learning-based methods across diverse urban driving situations in real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization.

The research community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles (AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models' performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e., SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.) still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892, truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values, confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 14 figures | None |

Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in 2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI benchmark.

To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Safe Driving in Occluded Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13114v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safe autonomous driving in the presence of occlusions poses a significant challenge in its policy design. While existing model-driven control techniques based on set invariance can handle visible risks, occlusions create latent risks in which safety-critical states are not observable. Data-driven techniques also struggle to handle latent risks because direct mappings from risk-critical objects in sensor inputs to safe actions cannot be learned without visible risk-critical objects. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic safety certificate for latent risk. Our key technical enabler is the application of probabilistic invariance: It relaxes the strict observability requirements imposed by set-invariance methods that demand the knowledge of risk-critical states. The proposed techniques provide linear action constraints that confine the latent risk probability within tolerance. Such constraints can be integrated into model predictive controllers or embedded in data-driven policies to mitigate latent risks. The proposed method is tested using the CARLA simulator and compared with a few existing techniques. The theoretical and empirical analysis jointly demonstrate that the proposed methods assure long-term safety in real-time control in occluded environments without being overly conservative and with transparency to exposed risks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context. Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation to evaluating autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures | None |

Consequently, obstacle detection latency is critical to the safety and effectiveness of autonomous driving systems. However, the latency of the obstacle detection module and its resilience to various changes in the LiDAR point cloud data are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive investigation on measuring and modeling the performance of the obstacle detection modules in two industry-grade autonomous driving systems, i.e., Apollo and Autoware. Learning from this investigation, we introduce ADPerf, a tool that aims to generate realistic point cloud data test cases that can expose increased detection latency. Increasing latency decreases the availability of the detected obstacles and stresses the capabilities of subsequent modules in autonomous driving systems, i.e., the modules may be negatively impacted by the increased latency in obstacle detection. We applied ADPerf to stress-test the performance of widely used 3D obstacle detection modules in autonomous driving systems, as well as the propagation of such tests on trajectory prediction modules. Our evaluation highlights the need to conduct performance testing of obstacle detection components, especially 3D obstacle detection, as they can be a major bottleneck to increased latency of the autonomous driving system. Such an adverse outcome will also further propagate to other modules, reducing the overall reliability of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> | None |

This requires building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data. Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/projects/simuli</p></details> | None |

However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</p></details> |  | None |

Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC) 2026 - Las Vegas, NV, USA 9 - 12 January 2026</p></details> | None |

The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted by ASE 2025</p></details> | None |

To achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent decision-making framework in complex scenarios.

However, existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion. CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.</p></details> |  | None |

This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects, while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS.</p></details> |  | None |

Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the first time, angle-based perception was introduced into the multi-modality image fusion task</p></details> | None |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into ADSs to support high-level decision-making through their powerful reasoning, instruction-following, and communication abilities. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs leverage language-driven communication and coordination to enhance inter-agent collaboration. This paper provides a frontier survey of this emerging intersection between NLP and multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based methods based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans. Finally, we summarize key applications, datasets, and challenges to support future research.</p></details> |  | None |

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and data-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles.

While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.</p></details> |  | None |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa) |

The COOOL benchmark targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies, and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models (VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events.

Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has been utilized in numerous robotic applications due to its appealing characteristics to solve non-convex optimization problems. However, the stochastic nature of sampling-based methods can cause significant chattering in the resulting commands. Chattering becomes more prominent in cases where the environment changes rapidly, possibly even causing the MPPI to diverge. To address this issue, we propose a method that seamlessly combines MPPI with an input-lifting strategy. In addition, we introduce a new action cost to smooth control sequence during trajectory rollouts while preserving the information theoretic interpretation of MPPI, which was derived from non-affine dynamics. We validate our method in two nonlinear control tasks with neural network dynamics: a pendulum swing-up task and a challenging autonomous driving task. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the MPPI baselines with additionally applied smoothing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (and IROS 2022).

| **[Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08045v5)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</p></details> |  | None |

For these vehicles, as well as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics. In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ICAR 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant (de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering, liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows 95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from 521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h) on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> | None |
| **[Data Scaling Laws for Imitation Learning-Based End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02689v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm has recently attracted lots of attention due to its scalability. However, existing methods are constrained by the limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration of the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address this issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and behaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing imitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically, approximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were gathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We performed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400 diverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop) under stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we discovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law relationship with the amount of data, but this is not the case in closed-loop evaluation. The inconsistency between the two assessments shifts our focus toward the distribution of data rather than merely expanding its volume. (2) a small increase in the quantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the corresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to achieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions. Our results highlight the critical role of data scaling in improving the generalizability of models across diverse autonomous driving scenarios, assuring safe deployment in the real world..

| **[Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11092v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 | None |

Learning-based approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models, removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation, which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures.

We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.</p></details> | 5 pages | None |
| **[Game-Theoretic Risk-Shaped Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10960v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety, efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L) framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate, collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency.

| **[Neutral Agent-based Adversarial Policy Learning against Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-party Open Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10937v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and dependent on interactions with victim agents. To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Since vehicles always cruise in highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy, while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous driving systems.

Traditionally, difficult scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually. However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset.

However, their behavior is often governed by a cost function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning for broader autonomous driving applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to the IEEE ICRA 2026, Vienna, Austria</p></details> | None |
| **[Align2Act: Instruction-Tuned Models for Human-Aligned Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10503v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and 66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM planners.</p></details> |  | None |

This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Risk-Budgeted Control Framework for Balanced Performance and Safety in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10442v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a risk-budgeted monitor with a control framework that certifies safety for autonomous driving. In this process, a sliding window is proposed to monitor for insufficient barrier residuals or nonzero tail risk, ensuring system safety. When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers switching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control barrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF) to address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time triggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In the FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a suboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints for the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety margin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it falls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF constraints. The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC) for autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization noise and obstacle position uncertainties. Multiple AV-pedestrian interaction scenarios are considered, with 1,500 Monte Carlo runs conducted for all scenarios. In the most challenging setting with pedestrian detection uncertainty of 5 m, the proposed framework achieves a 94-96% success rate of not colliding with the pedestrians over 300 trials while maintaining the lowest mean cross-track error (CTE = 3.2-3.6 m) to the reference path. The reduced CTE indicates faster trajectory recovery after obstacle avoidance, demonstrating a balance between safety and performance.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  | None |

Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.</p></details> |  | None |

Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving.

| **[Improving Hierarchical Representations of Vectorized HD Maps with Perspective Clues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11155v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The construction of vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps from onboard surround-view cameras has become a significant focus in autonomous driving. However, current map vector estimation pipelines face two key limitations: input-agnostic queries struggle to capture complex map structures, and the view transformation leads to information loss. These issues often result in inaccurate shape restoration or missing instances in map predictions. To address this concern, we propose a novel approach, namely \textbf{PerCMap}, which explicitly exploits clues from perspective-view features at both instance and point level. Specifically, at instance level, we propose Cross-view Instance Activation (CIA) to activate instance queries across surround-view images, thereby helping the model recover the instance attributes of map vectors. At point level, we design Dual-view Point Embedding (DPE), which fuses features from both views to generate input-aware positional embeddings and improve the accuracy of point coordinate estimation. Extensive experiments on \textit{nuScenes} and \textit{Argoverse 2} demonstrate that PerCMap achieves strong and consistent performance across benchmarks, reaching 67.1 and 70.5 mAP, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Style-Based Metric for Quantifying the Synthetic-to-Real Gap in Autonomous Driving Image Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10203v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures | None |
| **[Beyond ADE and FDE: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Safety-Critical Prediction in Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10086v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution. Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation, contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, there has been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset. All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.</p></details> |  | None |

We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a computer vision conference (under review)</p></details> | None |

However, LiDAR's high cost continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).</p></details> |  | None |

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally, extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench, demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across all scales and scenarios.

Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control. Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries, outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection choice.

Although calibrated physics-based and trained data-driven CFMs can replicate human driving behavior, their reliance on specific datasets limits generalization across diverse scenarios and reduces reliability in real-world deployment. Moreover, these models typically focus on behavioral fidelity and do not support the explicit optimization of local and string stability, which are increasingly important for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge-Informed Deep Learning (KIDL) paradigm that distills the generalization capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into a lightweight and stability-aware neural architecture. LLMs are used to extract fundamental car-following knowledge beyond dataset-specific patterns, and this knowledge is transferred to a reliable, tractable, and computationally efficient model through knowledge distillation. KIDL also incorporates stability constraints directly into its training objective, ensuring that the resulting model not only emulates human-like behavior but also satisfies the local and string stability requirements essential for real-world AV deployment. We evaluate KIDL on the real-world NGSIM and HighD datasets, comparing its performance with representative physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid CFMs. Both empirical and theoretical results consistently demonstrate KIDL's superior behavioral generalization and traffic flow stability, offering a robust and scalable solution for next-generation traffic systems.</p></details> |  | None |

As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations.

However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle running the Autoware Universe platform.

While open-set detection methods aim to address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii) they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation. Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Exploring Single Domain Generalization of LiDAR-based Semantic Segmentation under Imperfect Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09035v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

| **[Scalable Offline Metrics for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08571v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work, we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13% improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2025 (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)</p></details> | None |
| **[ResAD: Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08562v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Approximate Domain Unlearning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08132v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g., illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code: https://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning/.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> | [Code Link](https://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning) |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop, interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the absence of explicit depth information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g., 3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based collaborative perception systems.

With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.</p></details> |  | None |

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures | [Code Link](https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench) |

This information is often unavailable to those who did not design the vehicle and represents a typical issue in autonomous driving applications, which are frequently developed on top of existing vehicles; therefore, vehicle models are developed under conditions of information scarcity. This paper proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic conditions. It also shows good robustness when subject to noisy input data across the interested frequency components. Furthermore, being entirely data-driven and free from physical constraints, the model exhibits physical consistency in the output signals, such as longitudinal and lateral accelerations, yaw rate, and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity.</p></details> |  | None |

| **[A Digital Twin Framework for Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems Using Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07133v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion, our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario. The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment, we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1 score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing solution for autonomous vehicle safety.</p></details> |  | None |

State-of-the-art approaches, particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose \textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD \textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit, global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.</p></details> | 16 pages | None |

Generation of LiDAR-Invisible Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06952v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However, existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity, and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation (Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate 3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  | None |

However, psychological barriers continue to impede widespread AV adoption, despite technological progress. This paper addresses the critical yet often overlooked aspect of psychological safety in AV design and operation. While traditional safety standards focus primarily on physical safety, this paper emphasizes the psychological implications that arise from human interactions with autonomous vehicles, highlighting the importance of trust and perceived risk as significant factors influencing user acceptance. The paper makes a methodological proposal, a framework for addressing AVs psychological safety consisting of three key contributions. First, it introduces a definition of psychological safety in AVs context. Secondly, it proposes a risk model for identifying and assessing AVs psychological hazards and risks. PsySIL (Psychological Safety Integrity Level), a classification of AV psychological risk levels is developed. Thirdly, an adapted system-theoretic analysis method for AVs psychological safety is proposed. The paper illustrates the application of the framework for assessing potential psychological hazards using a scenario involving a family's experience with an autonomous vehicle, pioneering a systems approach towards evaluating situations that could lead to psychological harm. By establishing a framework that incorporates psychological safety alongside physical safety, the paper contributes to the broader discourse on the safe deployment of autonomous vehicle, aiming to guide future developments in user-centred design and regulatory practices, while acknowledging the limitations brought by the application of the proposals on a rather simple but pedagogical illustrative example.</p></details> |  | None |

Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

Light field and LiDAR modalities provide complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps, enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> | None |

However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient learning for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Current methods attempt to reduce this burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth (GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Precise and Efficient Collision Prediction under Uncertainty in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05729v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research introduces two efficient methods to estimate the collision risk of planned trajectories in autonomous driving under uncertain driving conditions. Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors, and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning.

| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Automotive LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04969v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, self-supervised representation learning relying on vast amounts of unlabeled data has been explored as a pre-training method for autonomous driving. However, directly applying popular contrastive or generative methods to this problem is insufficient and may even lead to negative transfer. In this paper, we present AD-L-JEPA, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework with a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) for automotive LiDAR object detection. Unlike existing methods, AD-L-JEPA is neither generative nor contrastive. Instead of explicitly generating masked regions, our method predicts Bird's-Eye-View embeddings to capture the diverse nature of driving scenes. Furthermore, our approach eliminates the need to manually form contrastive pairs by employing explicit variance regularization to avoid representation collapse. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements on the LiDAR 3D object detection downstream task across the KITTI3D, Waymo, and ONCE datasets, while reducing GPU hours by 1.9x-2.7x and GPU memory by 2.8x-4x compared with the state-of-the-art method Occupancy-MAE. Notably, on the largest ONCE dataset, pre-training on 100K frames yields a 1.61 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 100K or 500K frames, and pre-training on 500K frames yields a 2.98 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 500K or 1M frames. AD-L-JEPA constitutes the first JEPA-based pre-training method for autonomous driving. It offers better quality, faster, and more GPU-memory-efficient self-supervised representation learning. The source code of AD-L-JEPA is ready to be released.</p></details> |  | None |

The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

However, vehicle mobility leads to spatio-temporal unpredictability of resource demands, while real-time double auctions incur significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose a look-ahead contract-based auction framework that shifts decision-making from runtime to planning time. Our approach establishes N-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and modified double auctions. The system operates in two stages: first, an LSTM-based prediction module forecasts multi-slot resource needs and determines ES roles (buyer or seller), after which a pre-double auction generates contracts specifying resource quantities, prices, and penalties. Second, these contracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions. The framework incorporates energy costs, transmission overhead, and contract breach risks into utility models, ensuring truthful, rational, and energy-efficient trading. Experiments on real-world (UTD19) and synthetic traces demonstrate that our method improves time efficiency, energy use, and social welfare compared with existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

While traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement over the previous best performing method.

Existing methods often collapse diverse driving behaviors, lack long-horizon consistency, or require task-specific engineering that limits generalization. This paper presents KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion component generates temporally coherent action sequences, while the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://perfectxu88.github.io/KDP-AD/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://perfectxu88.github.io/KDP-AD) |

Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> | None |

This lack of standardized evaluation slows progress toward safe and reliable AI for urban mobility. We introduce AutoDrive-QA, the first benchmark that systematically converts open-ended driving QA datasets (DriveLM, NuScenes-QA, LingoQA) into structured multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with distractors grounded in five realistic error categories: Driving Domain Misconceptions, Logical Inconsistencies, Misinterpreted Sensor Inputs, Computational Oversights, and Question Ambiguity. This framework enables reproducible and interpretable evaluation of VLMs across perception, prediction, and planning tasks in complex urban scenes. Experiments show that fine-tuning LLaVA-1.5-7B improves accuracy by about six percentage points across tasks, GPT-4V achieves the strongest zero-shot performance with up to 69.8% accuracy, and Qwen2-VL models also perform competitively, particularly in multi-view settings. Moreover, traditional metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr fail to distinguish strong from weak models. By providing an objective, domain-grounded evaluation protocol, AutoDrive-QA contributes to more transparent benchmarking of urban AI systems, supporting the development of safer and more trustworthy autonomous driving technologies for smart cities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated results with larger dataset experiments and expanded discussion</p></details> | None |

While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.</p></details> |  | None |

Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance. Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent advances in vision-language learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks. However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC) dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the SOREC dataset.

Furthermore, an independent backup loop runs concurrently to provide safe fallback trajectories when an optimal trajectory cannot be computed by the main loop within a critical time frame, thus enhancing safety and real-time performance. Our evaluation showcases the benefits of the proposed methods in various driving scenarios, highlighting the real-time applicability and robustness of our approach. Overall, the framework represents a significant step towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving in complex and dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 IEEE 101st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2025-Spring), Oslo, Norway, June 17-20, 2025.

We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Large vision foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines.

To address these challenges, we introduce GS-Share, a photorealistic map-sharing system with a compact representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update. We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively. Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission overhead by 36%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures | None |

However, current approaches encounter challenges due to the inability of point cloud encoders to effectively capture local details and long-range spatial relationships, as well as a significant modality gap between text and point cloud representations. To address these challenges, we present Des4Pos, a novel two-stage text-driven remote sensing localization framework. In the coarse stage, the point-cloud encoder utilizes the Multi-scale Fusion Attention Mechanism (MFAM) to enhance local geometric features, followed by a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to strengthen global spatial relationships. Concurrently, the Stepped Text Encoder (STE) integrates cross-modal prior knowledge from CLIP [1] and aligns text and point-cloud features using this prior knowledge, effectively bridging modality discrepancies. In the fine stage, we introduce a Cascaded Residual Attention (CRA) module to fuse cross-modal features and predict relative localization offsets, thereby achieving greater localization precision. Experiments on the KITTI360Pose test set demonstrate that Des4Pos achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-point-cloud place recognition. Specifically, it attains a top-1 accuracy of 40% and a top-10 accuracy of 77% under a 5-meter radius threshold, surpassing the best existing methods by 7% and 7%, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |

In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target model and selectively skips communication and computation for server operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model only inference.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures | None |

However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication addresses these limits by enabling collaboration across vehicles and infrastructure, but it also faces heterogeneity, synchronization, and latency constraints. Language models offer strong knowledge-driven reasoning and decision-making capabilities, but they are not inherently designed to process raw sensor streams and are prone to hallucination. We propose V2X-UniPool, the first framework that unifies V2X perception with language-based reasoning for knowledge-driven AD. It transforms multimodal V2X data into structured, language-based knowledge, organizes it in a time-indexed knowledge pool for temporally consistent reasoning, and employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground decisions in real-time context. Experiments on the real-world DAIR-V2X dataset show that V2X-UniPool achieves state-of-the-art planning accuracy and safety while reducing communication cost by more than 80\%, achieving the lowest overhead among evaluated methods.

LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions.

This work addresses confidence calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same method.</p></details> |  | None |

Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

| **[Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01545v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v6)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference, converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11 + BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for AV pipelines.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages | None |

Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.</p></details> |  | None |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  | None |

In parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy, generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants, and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy, bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent agents.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers. Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

While many detection models aim to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern. In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN) alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose- and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

We propose a multi-view projection framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our method aligns LiDAR scans into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to generate large-scale synthetic 2D datasets (PC2D) in various modalities. An ensemble of 2D segmentation models is trained on these modalities, and during inference, hundreds of views per scene are processed, with logits back-projected to 3D using an occlusion-aware voting scheme to produce point-wise labels. These labels can be used directly or to fine-tune a 3D segmentation model in the target domain. We evaluate our approach in both Real-to-Real and Simulation-to-Real UDA, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Real-to-Real setting. Furthermore, we show that our framework enables segmentation of rare classes, leveraging only 2D annotations for those classes while relying on 3D annotations for others in the source domain.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce LargeAD, a versatile and scalable framework designed for large-scale 3D pretraining across diverse real-world driving datasets. Our framework leverages VFMs to extract semantically rich superpixels from 2D images, which are aligned with LiDAR point clouds to generate high-quality contrastive samples. This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection.

Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View (BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency. To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to 41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency optimization.</p></details> |  | None |

To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9.

| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on existing large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. More critically, these datasets are highly imbalanced in scenario density, with normal driving scenes (low-moderate traffic) overwhelmingly dominating the datasets, while high-density and safety-critical cases are underrepresented. As a result, models tend to overfit low/moderate-density scenarios and perform poorly in high-density scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the SSTP framework, which constructs a compact yet density-balanced dataset tailored to trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages: (1)Extraction, where a baseline model is pretrained for a few epochs to obtain stable gradient estimates, and the dataset is partitioned by scenario density. (2)Selection, where gradient-based scores and a submodular objective select representative samples within each density category, while biased sampling emphasizes rare high-density interactions to avoid dominance by low-density cases. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Experiments on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets with recent state-of-the-art models show that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Robust trajectory prediction depends not only on data scale but also on balancing scene density to ensure reliable performance under complex multi agent interactions.</p></details> |  | None |

While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline. These findings demonstrate the practical advantages of a physics-informed and feature-rich machine learning framework for real-time lane-change intention prediction in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines. Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths, this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents.

| **[Adaptive Conformal Guidance for Learning under Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16736v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning with guidance has proven effective across a wide range of machine learning systems. Guidance may, for example, come from annotated datasets in supervised learning, pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning, and expert demonstration policies in reinforcement learning. However, guidance signals can be noisy due to domain shifts and limited data availability and may not generalize well. Blindly trusting such signals when they are noisy, incomplete, or misaligned with the target domain can lead to degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Conformal Guidance (AdaConG), a simple yet effective approach that dynamically modulates the influence of guidance signals based on their associated uncertainty, quantified via split conformal prediction (CP). By adaptively adjusting to guidance uncertainty, AdaConG enables models to reduce reliance on potentially misleading signals and enhance learning performance. We validate AdaConG across diverse tasks, including knowledge distillation, semi-supervised image classification, gridworld navigation, and autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaConG improves performance and robustness under imperfect guidance, e.g., in gridworld navigation, it accelerates convergence and achieves over $6\times$ higher rewards than the best-performing baseline.

However, traditional HD map generation is labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments. To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data, our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates, demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>19th ...</summary><p>19th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics</p></details> | None |
| **[ReCogDrive: A Reinforced Cognitive Framework for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08052v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have explored leveraging the world knowledge and cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address the long-tail problem in end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing methods typically formulate trajectory planning as a language modeling task, where physical actions are output in the language space, potentially leading to issues such as format-violating outputs, infeasible actions, and slow inference speeds. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, a novel Reinforced Cognitive framework for end-to-end autonomous Driving, unifying driving understanding and planning by integrating an autoregressive model with a diffusion planner. First, to instill human driving cognition into the VLM, we introduce a hierarchical data pipeline that mimics the sequential cognitive process of human drivers through three stages: generation, refinement, and quality control. Building on this cognitive foundation, we then address the language-action mismatch by injecting the VLM's learned driving priors into a diffusion planner to efficiently generate continuous and stable trajectories. Furthermore, to enhance driving safety and reduce collisions, we introduce a Diffusion Group Relative Policy Optimization (DiffGRPO) stage, reinforcing the planner for enhanced safety and comfort. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that ReCogDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, qualitative results across diverse driving scenarios and DriveBench highlight the model's scene comprehension. All code, model weights, and datasets will be made publicly available to facilitate subsequent research.</p></details> |  | None |

However, despite the perception stability in harsh environments, the point cloud generated by mmWave radar is relatively sparse while containing significant noise, which limits its further development. Traditional mmWave radar enhancement approaches often struggle to leverage the effectiveness of diffusion models in super-resolution, largely due to the unnatural range-azimuth heatmap (RAH) or bird's eye view (BEV) representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that pioneers the application of fusing range images with image diffusion models, achieving accurate and dense mmWave radar point clouds that are similar to LiDAR. Benefitting from the projection that aligns with human observation, the range image representation of mmWave radar is close to natural images, allowing the knowledge from pre-trained image diffusion models to be effectively transferred, significantly improving the overall performance. Extensive evaluations on both public datasets and self-constructed datasets demonstrate that our approach provides substantial improvements, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in generating truly three-dimensional LiDAR-like point clouds via mmWave radar. Code will be released after publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

However, their effectiveness in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> | None |

Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next, we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs, the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.</p></details> |  | None |

Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception; however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to address the Sensor2Sensor domain gap in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of state-of-the-art CP methods and S2S-Net is conducted on the SCOPE dataset. This study shows that, all evaluated state-of-the-art mehtods for collective perception highly suffer from the Sensor2Sensor domain gap, while S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high performance in unseen sensor domains and outperforms the evaluated state-of-the-art methods by up to 44 percentage points.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing 2D and 3D physical attacks, due to their focus on texture optimization, often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates complex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\% to 7.38\%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

A key component of these systems is the shared function library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process sensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical role in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored vulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based attack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven multi-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how agents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions to select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command formats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with deceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as misinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other agents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two representative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its ability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific agents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms. Our results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple toolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving systems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.</p></details> |  | None |

In complex urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, the ability to understand road topology, a key requirement for safe navigation, has received relatively little attention. While some recent works have begun to explore VLMs in driving contexts, their performance on topology reasoning is far from satisfactory. In this work, we systematically evaluate VLMs' capabilities in road topology understanding. Specifically, multi-view images are projected into unified ground-plane coordinate system and fused into bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Based on these BEV lanes, we formulate four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks, which together capture essential components of spatial topology reasoning. Through extensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some temporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in vector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source VLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also find that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size, length of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures | None |

Although existing data-driven simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the leaderboard at the time of submission.</p></details> |  | None |

However, they suffer from inherent limitations in interpretability and generalizability--issues of critical importance in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce Symbolic Imitation Learning (SIL), a novel framework that leverages Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive explainable and generalizable driving policies from synthetic datasets. We evaluate SIL on real-world HighD and NGSim datasets, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art neural imitation learning methods using metrics such as collision rate, lane change efficiency, and average speed. The results indicate that SIL significantly enhances policy transparency while maintaining strong performance across varied driving conditions.

Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[AutoPrune: Each Complexity Deserves a Pruning Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23931v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness.

Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections.

However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> | None |

This survey systematically reviews four core research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception. Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models. Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures | None |

To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment.

Existing approaches typically generate full future occupancy states from VAE-style latent encodings, which can be computationally expensive and redundant. We propose Delta-Triplane Transformers (DTT), a novel 4D OWM for autonomous driving, that introduces two key innovations: (1) a triplane based representation that encodes 3D occupancy more compactly than previous approaches, and (2) an incremental prediction strategy for OWM that models {\em changes} in occupancy rather than dealing with full states. The core insight is that changes in the compact 3D latent space are naturally sparser and easier to model, enabling higher accuracy with a lighter-weight architecture. Building on this representation, DTT extracts multi-scale motion features from historical data and iteratively predict future triplane deltas. These deltas are combined with past states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTT delivers a 1.44$\times$ speedup (26 FPS) over the state of the art, improves mean IoU to 30.85, and reduces the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

| **[WorldSplat: Gaussian-Centric Feed-Forward 4D Scene Generation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23402v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.</p></details> |  | None |

Data-driven defenses such as jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding, while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100% with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications.

However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness throughout extended driving sequences.</p></details> |  | None |

To advance the field, several competitive platforms and benchmarks have been established to provide standardized datasets and evaluation protocols. Among these, leaderboards by the CARLA organization and nuPlan and the Waymo Open Dataset have become leading benchmarks for assessing motion planning algorithms. Each offers a unique dataset and challenging planning problems spanning a wide range of driving scenarios and conditions. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of the motion planning methods featured on these three leaderboards.

Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  | None |

While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of personalized driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving styles. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on NavSim benchmark. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures | None |

Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps. We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with significantly reduced computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

However, discrepancies between simulated and real-world behavior, known as the reality gap, challenge the transferability of test results to deployed systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study comparing four representative testing modalities: Software-in-the-Loop (SiL), Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL), Mixed-Reality (MR), and full real-world testing. Using a small-scale physical vehicle equipped with real sensors (camera and LiDAR) and its digital twin, we implement each setup and evaluate two ADS architectures (modular and end-to-end) across diverse indoor driving scenarios involving real obstacles, road topologies, and indoor environments. We systematically assess the impact of each testing modality along three dimensions of the reality gap: actuation, perception, and behavioral fidelity. Our results show that while SiL and ViL setups simplify critical aspects of real-world dynamics and sensing, MR testing improves perceptual realism without compromising safety or control. Importantly, we identify the conditions under which failures do not transfer across testing modalities and isolate the underlying dimensions of the gap responsible for these discrepancies. Our findings offer actionable insights into the respective strengths and limitations of each modality and outline a path toward more robust and transferable validation of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '25)</p></details> | None |

Traditional large-scale map construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions, outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods, resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen, for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1) representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3) developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations. Our code will be released.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures | None |

However, existing methods are often constrained by a passive perception paradigm, relying solely on text-based reasoning. This passivity restricts the model's capacity to actively seek crucial visual evidence when faced with uncertainty. To address this, we introduce DriveAgent-R1, the first autonomous driving agent capable of active perception for planning. In complex scenarios, DriveAgent-R1 proactively invokes tools to perform visual reasoning, firmly grounding its decisions in visual evidence, thereby enhancing both interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid thinking framework, inspired by human driver cognitive patterns, allowing the agent to adaptively switch between efficient text-only reasoning and robust tool-augmented visual reasoning based on scene complexity. This capability is cultivated through a three-stage progressive training strategy, featuring a core Cascaded Reinforcement Learning (Cascaded RL) phase. Extensive experiments on the Drive-Internal dataset, which is rich in long-tail scenarios, and the public nuScenes dataset show that, with only 3B parameters, DriveAgent-R1 achieves competitive performance comparable to top closed model systems such as GPT-5 and to human driving proficiency while remaining deployment-friendly, offering a proven path toward building more intelligent autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[An Adaptive ICP LiDAR Odometry Based on Reliable Initial Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22058v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key technology for autonomous navigation and positioning in mobile robots, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry is widely used in autonomous driving applications. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map, achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds. Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy of LiDAR odometry.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability.

To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  | None |

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by drivers of autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from drivers' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either.

However, existing learning-based planners rely heavily on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting undesirable behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a two-stage trajectory planning framework that decouples principle alignment from behavior learning. In the first stage, a general trajectory predictor is pre-trained on expert data to capture diverse, human-like driving behaviors. In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned with rule-based rewards using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), explicitly aligning ego planning with principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. This two-stage paradigm retains human-like behaviors while enhancing safety awareness and discarding undesirable patterns from demonstrations. Furthermore, we identify a key limitation of directly applying GRPO to planning: group-wise normalization erases cross-group scale differences, causing rare, high-variance safety-violation groups to have similar advantages as abundant low-variance safe groups, thereby suppressing optimization for safety-critical objectives. To address this, we propose Variance-Decoupled GRPO (VD-GRPO), which replaces normalization with centering and fixed scaling to preserve absolute reward magnitudes, ensuring that safety-critical objectives remain dominant throughout training. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance, particularly in realistic reactive settings.

Specifically, we introduce a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware relation encoder. Additionally, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding.

In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.</p></details> |  | None |
