| **[Conditional Flow Matching for Continuous Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Driving on a Manifold-Aware Spectral Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17586v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid System Planning using a Mixed-Integer ADMM Heuristic and Hybrid Zonotopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17574v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems is challenging due to the use of mixed-integer programming, which is computationally intensive and often sensitive to the specific numerical formulation. To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics. The proposed methods for hybrid system planning on embedded hardware are experimentally applied in a combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[HiMAP: History-aware Map-occupancy Prediction with Fallback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17231v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion forecasting is critical for autonomous driving, yet most predictors rely on multi-object tracking (MOT) with identity association, assuming that objects are correctly and continuously tracked. When tracking fails due to, e.g., occlusion, identity switches, or missed detections, prediction quality degrades and safety risks increase. We present \textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\% in FDE, 12\% in ADE, and a 4\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet. Beyond aggregate metrics, HiMAP delivers stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously without waiting for tracking to recover, highlighting its practical value for safety-critical autonomy.

| **[Multi-session Localization and Mapping Exploiting Topological Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17226v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating in previously visited environments is becoming increasingly crucial for autonomous systems, with direct applications in autonomous driving, surveying, and warehouse or household robotics. This repeated exposure to observing the same areas poses significant challenges for mapping and localization -- key components for enabling any higher-level task. In this work, we propose a novel multi-session framework that builds on map-based localization, in contrast to the common practice of greedily running full SLAM sessions and trying to find correspondences between the resulting maps. Our approach incorporates a topology-informed, uncertainty-aware decision-making mechanism that analyzes the pose-graph structure to detect low-connectivity regions, selectively triggering mapping and loop closing modules. The resulting map and pose-graph are seamlessly integrated into the existing model, reducing accumulated error and enhancing global consistency. We validate our method on overlapping sequences from datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world mine-like environment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[3D Scene Rendering with Multimodal Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17124v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene reconstruction and rendering are core tasks in computer vision, with applications spanning industrial monitoring, robotics, and autonomous driving. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.</p></details> |  | None |

Boreas-RT comprises 60 sequences collected over 9 real-world routes, totalling 643 km of driving. Each route is traversed multiple times, enabling evaluation in identical environments under varying traffic and, in some cases, weather conditions. The data collection platform includes a 5MP FLIR Blackfly S camera, a 360 degree Navtech RAS6 Doppler-enabled spinning radar, a 128-channel 360 degree Velodyne Alpha Prime lidar, an Aeva Aeries II FMCW Doppler-enabled lidar, a Silicon Sensing DMU41 inertial measurement unit, and a Dynapar wheel encoder. Centimetre-level ground truth is provided via post-processed Applanix POS LV GNSS-INS data. The dataset includes precise extrinsic and intrinsic calibrations, a publicly available development kit, and a live leaderboard for odometry and metric localization. Benchmark results show that many state-of-the-art odometry and localization algorithms overfit to simple driving environments and degrade significantly on the more challenging Boreas-RT routes. Boreas-RT provides a unified dataset for evaluating multi-modal algorithms across diverse road conditions. The dataset, leaderboard, and development kit are available at www.boreas.utias.utoronto.ca.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 15 figures, 12 tables, submitted to The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> | None |
| **[Toward Human-Centered Human-AI Interaction: Advances in Theoretical Frameworks and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11812v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), machines are increasingly evolving into intelligent agents, and the human-machine relationship is shifting from traditional "human-computer interaction" toward a new paradigm of "human-AI collaboration." However, technology-centered approaches to AI development have gradually revealed limitations such as fragility, bias, and low explainability, highlighting the urgent need for human-centered AI (HCAI) design philosophy. As a systems engineering approach, the successful implementation of HCAI depends critically on the design and optimization of high-quality human-AI interaction (HAII). This paper systematically reviews our research team's nearly decade-long exploration and practice in HCAI. At the level of research vision, we were among the first in China to systematically propose HAII as an interdisciplinary field and to develop a human-centered conceptual framework for human--AI collaboration. At the theoretical level, we introduced frameworks for human-AI joint cognitive systems, team-level situation awareness among intelligent agents, and shared social understanding, forming a relatively comprehensive theoretical system. At the methodological level, we established a hierarchical HCAI framework and a taxonomy of HCAI implementation methods. At the application level, we conducted a series of studies in domains such as autonomous driving, intelligent aircraft cockpit, and trust in human-AI collaboration, empirically validating the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks. Looking ahead, research on HCAI and HAII must continue to advance along three dimensions: theoretical deepening, methodological innovation, and application expansion, promoting the development of an intelligent society that is human-centered and characterized by harmonious human-AI coexistence.</p></details> | in Chinese language | None |
| **[PredMapNet: Future and Historical Reasoning for Consistent Online HD Vectorized Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16669v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-definition (HD) maps are crucial to autonomous driving, providing structured representations of road elements to support navigation and planning. However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency.</p></details> | WACV 2026 | None |
| **[A Contrastive Learning Framework Empowered by Attention-based Feature Adaptation for Street-View Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16590v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/CLIP-MHAdapter.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/CLIP-MHAdapter) |
| **[Vision and Language: Novel Representations and Artificial intelligence for Driving Scene Safety Assessment and Autonomous Vehicle Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07680v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CARL: Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning for Spectral Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19223v4)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

| **[ScenicRules: An Autonomous Driving Benchmark with Multi-Objective Specifications and Abstract Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16073v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing autonomous driving systems for complex traffic environments requires balancing multiple objectives, such as avoiding collisions, obeying traffic rules, and making efficient progress. In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives. Our benchmark can be accessed at https://github.com/BerkeleyLearnVerify/ScenicRules/.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables.

| **[RPT-SR: Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15490v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Near-Optimal Sample Complexity for Online Constrained MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15076v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare. To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^3}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs. For strict feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with zero violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^5}{\varepsilon^2ζ^2}\right)$ learning episodes, where $ζ$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant characterizing the size of the feasible region. This result matches the lower bound for learning CMDPs with access to a generative model. Our results demonstrate that learning CMDPs in an online setting is as easy as learning with a generative model and is no more challenging than learning unconstrained MDPs when small violations are allowed.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ThermEval: A Structured Benchmark for Evaluation of Vision-Language Models on Thermal Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14989v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery, but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages with 2 figures of main content. 2 pages of References. 10 pages of appendix with 6 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[DM0: An Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action Model towards Physical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14974v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moving beyond the traditional paradigm of adapting internet-pretrained models to physical tasks, we present DM0, an Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for Physical AI. Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed in alphabetical order.

| **[DriveFine: Refining-Augmented Masked Diffusion VLA for Precise and Robust Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14577v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.</p></details> |  | [Code Link](https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine) |
| **[Multimodal Covariance Steering in Belief Space with Active Probing and Influence for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14540v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving in complex traffic requires reasoning under uncertainty. Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2026)</p></details> | None |
| **[V2V-LLM: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09980v4)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous driving vehicles rely mainly on their individual sensors to understand surrounding scenes and plan for future trajectories, which can be unreliable when the sensors are malfunctioning or occluded. To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multimodal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark. We also propose our baseline method Vehicle-to-Vehicle Multimodal Large Language Model (V2V-LLM), which uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and answer various types of driving-related questions: grounding, notable object identification, and planning. Experimental results show that our proposed V2V-LLM can be a promising unified model architecture for performing various tasks in cooperative autonomous driving, and outperforms other baseline methods that use different fusion approaches. Our work also creates a new research direction that can improve the safety of future autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released to the public to facilitate open-source research in this field.

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving has been proposed as a means of addressing this problem, and one recently introduced framework for cooperative autonomous driving has further adopted an approach that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to integrate cooperative perception and planning processes. However, despite the potential benefit of applying graph-of-thoughts reasoning to the MLLM, this idea has not been considered by previous cooperative autonomous driving research. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-of-thoughts framework specifically designed for MLLM-based cooperative autonomous driving. Our graph-of-thoughts includes our proposed novel ideas of occlusion-aware perception and planning-aware prediction. We curate the V2V-GoT-QA dataset and develop the V2V-GoT model for training and testing the cooperative driving graph-of-thoughts.

LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures.

However, Stanford-Car, the most widely used fine-grained dataset for car recognition, only has 196 different categories and only includes vehicle models produced earlier than 2013. Due to the rapid advancements in the automotive industry during recent years, the appearances of various car models have become increasingly intricate and sophisticated. Consequently, the previous Stanford-Car dataset fails to capture this evolving landscape and cannot satisfy the requirements of automotive industry. To address these challenges, in our paper, we introduce Car-1000, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for fine-grained visual categorization of diverse car models. Car-1000 encompasses vehicles from 166 different automakers, spanning a wide range of 1000 distinct car models. Additionally, we have reproduced several state-of-the-art FGVC methods on the Car-1000 dataset, establishing a new benchmark for research in this field. We hope that our work will offer a fresh perspective for future FGVC researchers.

However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost.</p></details> |  | None |

While recent methods often rely on high-definition (HD) maps to provide structured environmental priors, such maps are costly to maintain, geographically limited, and unreliable in dynamic or unmapped scenarios. Directly leveraging raw sensor data in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) space offers greater flexibility, but BEV features are dense and unstructured, making agent-centric spatial reasoning challenging and computationally inefficient. To address this, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a map-free framework that employs deformable attention to adaptively aggregate task-relevant context from sparse locations in dense BEV features. We further introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module that predicts a small set of realistic goals, enabling fully end-to-end multimodal forecasting without heuristic post-processing. Extensive experiments show that BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based methods while providing greater robustness and flexibility without relying on pre-built maps.

| **[Privacy-Concealing Cooperative Perception for BEV Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13555v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative perception systems for autonomous driving aim to overcome the limited perception range of a single vehicle by communicating with adjacent agents to share sensing information. While this improves perception performance, these systems also face a significant privacy-leakage issue, as sensitive visual content can potentially be reconstructed from the shared data. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation. Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved photorealistic modeling in autonomous driving scene reconstruction, but they primarily focus on normal-light conditions. Low-light driving scenes are more challenging to model due to their complex lighting and appearance conditions, which often causes performance degradation of existing methods. To address this problem, this work presents a novel approach that integrates physically based rendering into 3DGS to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving. Specifically, our approach integrates physically based rendering into composite scene Gaussian representations and jointly optimizes Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based material properties. We explicitly model diffuse components through a global illumination module and specular components by anisotropic spherical Gaussians. As a result, our approach improves reconstruction quality for outdoor nighttime driving scenes, while maintaining real-time rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse nighttime scenarios on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | ICRA 2026 | None |

Compared to camera-only perception systems, multi-modal pipelines, especially LiDAR-camera fusion methods, can produce more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Although voxel-based scene representations are widely used for semantic occupancy prediction, 3D Gaussians have emerged as a continuous and significantly more compact alternative. In this work, we propose a multi-modal Gaussian-based semantic occupancy prediction framework utilizing 3D deformable attention, namely GaussianFormer3D. We introduce a voxel-to-Gaussian initialization strategy that provides 3D Gaussians with accurate geometry priors from LiDAR data, and design a LiDAR-guided 3D deformable attention mechanism to refine these Gaussians using LiDAR-camera fusion features in a lifted 3D space. Extensive experiments on real-world on-road and off-road autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that GaussianFormer3D achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with reduced memory consumption and improved efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing robust CRL approaches predominantly focus on single-step perturbations and temporally independent adversarial models, lacking explicit modeling of robustness against temporally coupled perturbations. To tackle these challenges, we propose TCRL, a novel temporal-coupled adversarial training framework for robust constrained reinforcement learning (TCRL) in worst-case scenarios. First, TCRL introduces a worst-case-perceived cost constraint function that estimates safety costs under temporally coupled perturbations without the need to explicitly model adversarial attackers. Second, TCRL establishes a dual-constraint defense mechanism on the reward to counter temporally coupled adversaries while maintaining reward unpredictability. Experimental results demonstrate that TCRL consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness against temporally coupled perturbation attacks across a variety of CRL tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot leverage stitched pinhole images as a supervisory signal. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

Recent research aims to develop end-to-end models that jointly address perception and prediction; however, they often fail to fully exploit the synergy between appearance and motion cues, relying mainly on short-term visual features. We follow the idea of "looking backward to look forward", and propose MASAR, a novel fully differentiable framework for joint 3D detection and trajectory forecasting compatible with any transformer-based 3D detector. MASAR employs an object-centric spatio-temporal mechanism that jointly encodes appearance and motion features. By predicting past trajectories and refining them using guidance from appearance cues, MASAR captures long-term temporal dependencies that enhance future trajectory forecasting. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate MASAR's effectiveness, showing improvements of over 20% in minADE and minFDE while maintaining robust detection performance.

The dataset includes a variety of scenes from urban and rural India, encompassing highways, service roads, village paths, and congested city streets, captured in both daytime and nighttime settings. Roadscapes has been curated to advance research on visual scene understanding in unstructured environments.

However, efficiently allocating computational resources for deep learning applications in FPGA-based systems is a challenging task. A Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) is a parameterizable FPGA-based accelerator module optimized for ML inference. It supports a wide range of ML models and can be instantiated multiple times within a single FPGA to enable concurrent execution. This paper introduces DPUConfig, a novel runtime management framework, based on a custom Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, that dynamically selects optimal DPU configurations by leveraging real-time telemetry data monitoring, system utilization, power consumption, and application performance to inform its configuration selection decisions.

Recent approaches employ diffusion or flow matching models to generate realistic scenes, but 3D data remains limited compared to RGB datasets with millions of samples. We introduce R3DPA, the first LiDAR scene generation method to unlock image-pretrained priors for LiDAR point clouds, and leverage self-supervised 3D representations for state-of-the-art results. Specifically, we (i) align intermediate features of our generative model with self-supervised 3D features, which substantially improves generation quality; (ii) transfer knowledge from large-scale image-pretrained generative models to LiDAR generation, mitigating limited LiDAR datasets; and (iii) enable point cloud control at inference for object inpainting and scene mixing with solely an unconditional model.

To address these challenges, we propose Easy-Poly, a filter-based 3D MOT framework with four key innovations: (1) CNMSMM, a novel Camera-LiDAR fusion detection method combining multi-modal augmentation and an efficient NMS with a new loss function to improve small target detection; (2) Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO) data association that robustly handles uncertainties and occlusions via class-aware optimal assignment and parallel processing strategies; (3) Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM) using a confidence-weighted Kalman filter with adaptive noise covariance to enhance tracking accuracy; and (4) an extended life-cycle management system reducing identity switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30% to 65.65% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1% to 75.6%), while also running in real-time.

We identify a critical decoupling failure in current research: the lack of distinction between appearance-based shifts, such as weather and lighting, and structural scene changes. This leaves a fundamental question unanswered: Is the planner failing because of complex road geometry, or simply because it is raining? To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models. Our plug-and-play solution maintains consistent performance across extreme appearance shifts without requiring further fine-tuning.

Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance fields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer from low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D Gaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect to model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that exploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance refinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach is devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of transformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple granularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and dynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations between frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained changes of background and objects. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging autonomous driving datasets, namely, Waymo, KITTI, NOTR and VKITTI2, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICRA 2026 | None |

However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TITS.

For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens. To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.</p></details> |  | None |

Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence.

However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation. Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, submitted to CVPR Conference 2026</p></details> | None |

However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE TVCG</p></details> | None |

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.</p></details> | Preprint | None |

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems.

While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improves their reasoning ability, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset in developing safer and more reasoning-capable driving agents.

To this end, we first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality, formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-modal Feature Matching strategy coupled with a Multi-scale Gaussian Decoding model to enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning.

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

| **[Adaptive Time Step Flow Matching for Autonomous Driving Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10285v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires reasoning about interactions with surrounding traffic. A prevailing approach is large-scale imitation learning on expert driving datasets, aimed at generalizing across diverse real-world scenarios. For online trajectory generation, such methods must operate at real-time rates. Diffusion models require hundreds of denoising steps at inference, resulting in high latency. Consistency models mitigate this issue but rely on carefully tuned noise schedules to capture the multimodal action distributions common in autonomous driving. Adapting the schedule, typically requires expensive retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on conditional flow matching that jointly predicts future motions of surrounding agents and plans the ego trajectory in real time. We train a lightweight variance estimator that selects the number of inference steps online, removing the need for retraining to balance runtime and imitation learning performance. To further enhance ride quality, we introduce a trajectory post-processing step cast as a convex quadratic program, with negligible computational overhead. Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the framework performs maneuvers such as lane changes, cruise control, and navigating unprotected left turns without requiring scenario-specific tuning. Our method maintains a 20 Hz update rate on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, making it suitable for online deployment. Compared to transformer, diffusion, and consistency model baselines, we achieve improved trajectory smoothness and better adherence to dynamic constraints.

We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</p></details> | WIP | None |
| **[LD-ViCE: Latent Diffusion Model for Video Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08422v4)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Experiments on three diverse video datasets - EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition) with multiple target models covering both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that LD-ViCE generalizes well and achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, LD-ViCE achieves significantly higher regression accuracy than prior methods and exhibits high temporal consistency, while the refinement stage further improves perceptual quality. Qualitative analyses confirm that LD-ViCE produces semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, providing actionable insights into model behavior. LD-ViCE advances the trustworthiness and interpretability of video-based AI systems through visually coherent counterfactual explanations.</p></details> | 44 Pages | None |

In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA. Specifically, we consider three representative attack vectors on the visual perception pipeline: (i) a physics-based blur attack induced by acoustic waves, (ii) an electromagnetic interference attack that distorts captured images, and (iii) a digital attack that adds ghost objects as carefully crafted bounded perturbations on images. Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments across multi-camera inputs on CARLA show that our detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> | None |

However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

A key bottleneck is the need to collect many human demonstration trajectories when adapting driving policies to new cities that differ from those seen in training in terms of road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns. In this paper, we show that self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning can adapt a driving policy to a substantially different target city using only the map and meta-information, without requiring any human demonstrations from that city. We introduce NO data Map-based self-play for Autonomous Driving (NOMAD), which enables policy adaptation in a simulator constructed based on the target-city map.

However, such manual ordering design can inevitably cause information loss and cumulative errors, lacking flexible and diverse relation modeling among different modules and sensors. Meanwhile, insufficient training of image backbone and quadratic-complexity of attention mechanism also hinder the scalability and efficiency of E2E-AD system to handle spatiotemporal input. To this end, we propose DriveMamba, a Task-Centric Scalable paradigm for efficient E2E-AD, which integrates dynamic task relation modeling, implicit view correspondence learning and long-term temporal fusion into a single-stage Unified Mamba decoder. Specifically, both extracted image features and expected task outputs are converted into token-level sparse representations in advance, which are then sorted by their instantiated positions in 3D space. The linear-complexity operator enables efficient long-context sequential token modeling to capture task-related inter-dependencies simultaneously. Additionally, a bidirectional trajectory-guided "local-to-global" scan method is designed to preserve spatial locality from ego-perspective, thus facilitating the ego-planning. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superiority, generalizability and great efficiency of DriveMamba.</p></details> | Accepted to ICLR2026 | None |

These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates "corrective driving prompts" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation.

The cloud offers abundant compute, but the network has long been treated as an unreliable bottleneck rather than a co-equal part of the autonomous vehicle control loop. We argue that this separation is no longer tenable: safety-critical autonomy requires co-design of control, models, and network resource allocation itself. We introduce TURBO, a cloud-augmented control framework that addresses this challenge, formulating bandwidth allocation and control pipeline configuration across both the car and cloud as a joint optimization problem. TURBO maximizes benefit to the car while guaranteeing safety in the face of highly variable network conditions. We implement TURBO and evaluate it in both simulation and real-world deployment, showing it can improve average accuracy by up to 15.6%pt over existing on-vehicle-only pipelines.

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.</p></details> |  | None |

In highway on-ramp merging, a roadside unit (RSU) can sense nearby traffic, perform edge perception, and transmit state estimates to the ego vehicle over vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. With recent advancements in intelligent transportation infrastructure and edge computing, such RSU-assisted perception is increasingly realistic and already deployed in modern connected roadway systems. However, edge processing time and wireless transmission can introduce stochastic V2I communication delays, violating the Markov assumption and substantially degrading control performance. In this work, we propose DAROM, a Delay-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for On-ramp Merging that is robust to stochastic delays. We model the problem as a random delay Markov decision process (RDMDP) and develop a unified RL agent for joint longitudinal and lateral control. To recover a Markovian representation under delayed observations, we introduce a Delay-Aware Encoder that conditions on delayed observations, masked action histories, and observed delay magnitude to infer the current latent state. We further integrate a physics-based safety controller to reduce collision risk during merging. Experiments in the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulator using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset demonstrate that DAROM consistently outperforms standard RL baselines across traffic densities. In particular, the gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based encoder achieves over 99% success in high-density traffic with random V2I delays of up to 2.0 seconds.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Staged Framework for Safety Analysis of Offloaded Services in Distributed Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08821v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with function offloading for distributed, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offers the opportunity for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to extend their locally available services. One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs. Moreover, the simulation results also show the adaptability of the framework to diverse scenarios involving simultaneous offloading requests from multiple CAVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, published in RA-L</p></details> | None |

Therefore, point cloud compression plays a crucial role in practical applications for both human and machine perception optimization. To this end, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has established two standards for point cloud compression, including Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) and Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC). In the meantime, the Audio Video coding Standard (AVS) Workgroup of China also have launched and completed the development for its first generation point cloud compression standard, namely AVS PCC. This new standardization effort has adopted many new coding tools and techniques, which are different from the other counterpart standards.

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

While parallelization offers scalability, existing hybrid CPU-GPU solvers face critical bottlenecks due to host-device synchronization latency and branch divergence on SIMT architectures, limiting their utility for real-time planning and hindering real-robot deployment. We present Vec-QMDP, a CPU-native parallel planner that aligns POMDP search with modern CPUs' SIMD architecture, achieving $227\times$--$1073\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art serial planners. Vec-QMDP adopts a Data-Oriented Design (DOD), refactoring scattered, pointer-based data structures into contiguous, cache-efficient memory layouts. We further introduce a hierarchical parallelism scheme: distributing sub-trees across independent CPU cores and SIMD lanes, enabling fully vectorized tree expansion and collision checking. Efficiency is maximized with the help of UCB load balancing across trees and a vectorized STR-tree for coarse-level collision checking. Evaluated on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks, Vec-QMDP achieves state-of-the-art planning performance with millisecond-level latency, establishing CPUs as a high-performance computing platform for large-scale planning under uncertainty.</p></details> |  | None |

High-quality datasets are crucial for the development of effective data-driven autonomous driving solutions. Next-generation autonomous driving datasets must be multimodal, incorporating data from advanced sensors that feature extensive data coverage, detailed annotations, and diverse scene representation. To address this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The OmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six 4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception. The dataset comprises 1501 clips, each approximately 30-s long, totaling more than 450K synchronized frames and more than 5.85 million synchronized sensor data points. We also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200 clips with more than 514K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include semantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we introduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy ground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames. Alongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics, baseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar to explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our low-cost sensor configuration and its robustness under adverse conditions.

To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario. We then solve these subproblems in parallel and select one using the cost function from the original problem. To validate our work, we conduct simulations using different user responses to the questionnaire. We assess how effectively our planner reflects user preferences compared to preference-agnostic baseline planners by measuring preference alignment.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generating Adversarial Events: A Motion-Aware Point Cloud Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08230v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras have been widely adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and human-computer interaction. A pressing challenge arises from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which poses a significant threat to the reliability of event-based systems. Nevertheless, research into adversarial attacks on events is scarce. This is primarily due to the non-differentiable nature of mainstream event representations, which hinders the extension of gradient-based attack methods. In this paper, we propose MA-ADV, a novel \textbf{M}otion-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{Adv}ersarial framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to generate adversarial events by leveraging point cloud representations. MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search. Extensive experimental results validate that MA-ADV ensures a 100\% attack success rate with minimal perturbation cost, and also demonstrate enhanced robustness against defenses, underscoring the critical security challenges facing future event-based perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Self-Supervised Bootstrapping of Action-Predictive Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08167v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet current methods rely on rigid templates to specify reasoning primitives (e.g., objects in the scene, high-level plans, structural affordances). These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives. R&B-EnCoRe enables models to distill reasoning that is predictive of successful control, bypassing manual annotation engineering while grounding internet-scale knowledge in physical execution.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Collision Risk Estimation via Loss Prediction in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07425v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collision risk estimation and avoidance play central roles in the safety of autonomous driving (AD) systems. Recently emerged end-to-end AD systems gain collision avoidance ability by minimizing losses to penalize planning trajectories that are too close to other objects. Despite a significant collision rate during testing, most end-to-end planners do not explicitly quantify the collision risk in their outputs. To address this, we introduce RiskMonitor, an efficient plug-and-play module that interprets planning and motion tokens from state-of-the-art end-to-end planners to estimate collision risk. Inspired by loss prediction based uncertainty quantification, RiskMonitor predicts whether the collision loss -- commonly adopted to train end-to-end planners -- is positive along planned waypoints, framing collision risk estimation as a binary classification task. We evaluate RiskMonitor on the real-world nuScenes dataset (open-loop) and the neural-rendering based simulator, NeuroNCAP (closed-loop). Our token-driven method outperforms prediction-driven approaches, including deterministic rules, Gaussian mixture models, and Monte Carlo Dropout. When integrated with a simple braking policy, RiskMonitor improves collision avoidance ability by $66.5\%$ in a closed-loop test on safety-critical scenarios. These results demonstrate that monitoring collision risk using plan and motion tokens enhances the safety of end-to-end AD without retraining it.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[ForecastOcc: Vision-based Semantic Occupancy Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08006v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires forecasting both geometry and semantics over time to effectively reason about future environment states. Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023. They show the fastest fully autonomous lap of TUM Autonomous Motorsport, with vehicle speeds reaching 267 kph and lateral accelerations of up to 15 mps2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the IEEE IV 2024</p></details> | None |
| **[Steerable Adversarial Scenario Generation through Test-Time Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20102v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator (SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving policies.

| **[Adversarial Wear and Tear: Exploiting Natural Damage for Generating Physical-World Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21164v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of adversarial examples in the physical world poses significant challenges to the deployment of Deep Neural Networks in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Most existing methods for crafting physical-world adversarial examples are ad-hoc, relying on temporary modifications like shadows, laser beams, or stickers that are tailored to specific scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of physical-world adversarial examples, AdvWT, which draws inspiration from the naturally occurring phenomenon of `wear and tear', an inherent property of physical objects. Unlike manually crafted perturbations, `wear and tear' emerges organically over time due to environmental degradation, as seen in the gradual deterioration of outdoor signboards. To achieve this, AdvWT follows a two-step approach. First, a GAN-based, unsupervised image-to-image translation network is employed to model these naturally occurring damages, particularly in the context of outdoor signboards. The translation network encodes the characteristics of damaged signs into a latent `damage style code'. In the second step, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the style code, strategically optimizing its transformation process. This manipulation subtly alters the damage style representation, guiding the network to generate adversarial images where the appearance of damages remains perceptually realistic, while simultaneously ensuring their effectiveness in misleading neural networks. Through comprehensive experiments on two traffic sign datasets, we show that AdvWT effectively misleads DNNs in both digital and physical domains. AdvWT achieves an effective attack success rate, greater robustness, and a more natural appearance compared to existing physical-world adversarial examples. Additionally, integrating AdvWT into training enhances a model's generalizability to real-world damaged signs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions in Secure and Dependable Computing.

However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.</p></details> | ICRA 2026 | None |

Inspired by cognitive science, we propose the Mental Bayesian Causal World Model (MBCWM) and instantiate it as the Tokenized Intent World Model (TIWM), a novel cognitive computing architecture. Its core philosophy posits that intelligence emerges not from pixel-level objective fidelity, but from the Cognitive Consistency between the agent's internal intentional world and physical reality. By synthesizing von Uexküll's $\textit{Umwelt}$ theory, the neural assembly hypothesis, and the triple causal model (integrating symbolic deduction, probabilistic induction, and force dynamics) into an end-to-end embodied planning system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this paradigm on the nuPlan benchmark. Experimental results in open-loop validation confirm that our Belief-Intent Co-Evolution mechanism effectively enhances planning performance. Crucially, in closed-loop simulations, the system exhibits emergent human-like cognitive behaviors, including map affordance understanding, free exploration, and self-recovery strategies. We identify Cognitive Consistency as the core learning mechanism: during long-term training, belief (state understanding) and intent (future prediction) spontaneously form a self-organizing equilibrium through implicit computational replay, achieving semantic alignment between internal representations and physical world affordances. TIWM offers a neuro-symbolic, cognition-first alternative to reconstruction-based planners, establishing a new direction: planning as active understanding, not passive reaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset. Additionally, we conduct case studies on lane detection using a customized indoor track dataset and simulated driving scenarios in CARLA, where we further evaluate the model's generalizability under diverse environmental conditions.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p></details> |  | None |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a physical environment indirect prompt injection attack that exploits the multimodal language interpretation abilities of AI models. CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents: drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML).

RGB-Thermal fusion is a standard approach, yet existing methods apply static fusion strategies uniformly across all conditions, allowing modality-specific noise to propagate throughout the network. Hence, we propose CLARITY that dynamically adapts its fusion strategy to the detected scene condition. Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects. Experiments on the MFNet dataset demonstrate that CLARITY establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), achieving 62.3% mIoU and 77.5% mAcc.</p></details> |  | None |

In this work, we present RAPiD, a deterministic policy extraction framework that distills a pretrained diffusion-based planner into an efficient policy while eliminating diffusion sampling. Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning. Evaluations demonstrate that RAPiD achieves competitive performance on closed-loop nuPlan scenarios with an 8x speedup over diffusion baselines, while achieving state-of-the-art generalization among learning-based planners on the interPlan benchmark.

To this end, 3D object detection serves as the core basis of perception stack especially for the sake of path planning, motion prediction, and collision avoidance etc. Taking a quick glance at the progress we have made, we attribute challenges to visual appearance recovery in the absence of depth information from images, representation learning from partially occluded unstructured point clouds, and semantic alignments over heterogeneous features from cross modalities. Despite existing efforts, 3D object detection for autonomous driving is still in its infancy. Recently, a large body of literature have been investigated to address this 3D vision task. Nevertheless, few investigations have looked into collecting and structuring this growing knowledge. We therefore aim to fill this gap in a comprehensive survey, encompassing all the main concerns including sensors, datasets, performance metrics and the recent state-of-the-art detection methods, together with their pros and cons. Furthermore, we provide quantitative comparisons with the state of the art. A case study on fifteen selected representative methods is presented, involved with runtime analysis, error analysis, and robustness analysis. Finally, we provide concluding remarks after an in-depth analysis of the surveyed works and identify promising directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is accepted by Pattern Recognition on 14 May 2022</p></details> | None |

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> | None |

| **[Temperature Scaling Attack Disrupting Model Confidence in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06638v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 20 figures | None |

While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods fail to effectively unify future scene evolution and action planning within a single architecture due to inadequate sharing of latent states, limiting the impact of visual imagination on action decisions. To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision. Additionally, DriveWorld-VLA incorporates the latent states of the world model as core decision-making states for the VLA planner, facilitating the planner to assess how candidate actions impact future scene evolution. By conducting world modeling entirely in the latent space, DriveWorld-VLA supports controllable, action-conditioned imagination at the feature level, avoiding expensive pixel-level rollouts. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveWorld-VLA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes.

| **[Rebenchmarking Unsupervised Monocular 3D Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06488v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the 3D structure from a single image, particularly in occluded regions, remains a fundamental yet unsolved challenge in vision-centric autonomous driving. Existing unsupervised approaches typically train a neural radiance field and treat the network outputs as occupancy probabilities during evaluation, overlooking the inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols. Moreover, the prevalent use of 2D ground truth fails to reveal the inherent ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints. To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches but also matches the performance of supervised ones. Our source code and evaluation protocol will be made available upon publication.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Simulating the Visual World with Artificial Intelligence: A Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08585v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

| **[Addressing the Waypoint-Action Gap in End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Vehicle Motion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06214v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) systems are typically grouped by the nature of their outputs: (i) waypoint-based models that predict a future trajectory, and (ii) action-based models that directly output throttle, steer and brake. Most recent benchmark protocols and training pipelines are waypoint-based, which makes action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress. To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol. We extensively evaluate our framework across multiple challenging benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over the baselines. In particular, on NAVSIM \texttt{navhard} our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures | None |

However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by "baking in" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for "texture baking," while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

| **[Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence.

However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE IV 2026. 8 pages, 3 figures.

Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript includes 13 pages, 8 tables, and 7 figures</p></details> | None |
| **[Unified Sensor Simulation for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05617v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce \textbf{XSIM}, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving. XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

| **[Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05573v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer (ViGT), an autonomous driving geometric model that estimates continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view camera rigs. ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines. We further evaluate ViGT on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, where ViGT achieves comparable performance with supervised methods.

This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection, while also underscoring the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for VISAPP 2026</p></details> | None |

While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.</p></details> |  | None |

Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables; Project Page: https://xiaomi-mlab.github.io/MindDrive/</p></details> | [Code Link](https://xiaomi-mlab.github.io/MindDrive) |

This work introduces a novel optimization framework based on Quantum-Inspired Hybrid Swarm Intelligence (QiHSI), in which quantum-inspired mechanisms are embedded within a multi-objective salp swarm optimization process to strengthen global search capability and preserve population diversity in complex, high-dimensional decision spaces. In addition, a decision-maker-in-the-loop strategy is incorporated to incorporate adaptive expert guidance, enabling the optimization process to respond dynamically to changing design priorities and system constraints. The effectiveness of QiHSI is assessed using established multi-objective benchmark problems as well as a practical ADAS calibration scenario. Experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art evolutionary and swarm-based algorithms, including MSSA, MOPSO, MOEA/D, SPEA2, NSGA-III, and RVEA, show that the proposed method consistently produces well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions with faster convergence and improved adaptability. These findings demonstrate that QiHSI offers a reliable and scalable approach for intelligent ADAS calibration, supporting the development of more responsive, efficient, and safety-oriented autonomous driving technologies.</p></details> |  | None |

Map-free LiDAR relocalization offers an effective solution for achieving high-precision positioning in environments with weak or unavailable GNSS signals. However, existing LiDAR relocalization methods are primarily tailored to autonomous driving, exhibiting significantly degraded accuracy in UAV scenarios. In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory localization precision and consistently outperforms existing techniques by a significant margin. Our code and dataset will be released soon.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures | None |

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel pipeline that produces a neuro-symbolic feature representation that encompasses semantic, spatial, and shape information, as well as spatially boosted features of dynamic entities in the scene, with an emphasis on safety-critical road users. It also proposes a Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that balances human values via a symbolic reasoning module. Here, semantic and spatial predicates are extracted from segmentation maps and applied to linguistic rules to obtain reward weights.

These factors complicate accurate recognition of human intentions and the generation of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose SAP-CoPE, an indoor navigation system that integrates cooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a socially-aware model predictive control (MPC)-based motion planner. In the perception module, an optimization problem is formulated to account for uncertainty propagation in the camera projection matrix while enforcing human joint coherence. The proposed method is adaptable to both single- and multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse LiDAR point-cloud data. For motion planning, we integrate a psychology inspired personal-space field using the information from estimated human poses into an MPC framework to enhance socially comfort in human-populated environments. Extensive real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating socially aware trajectories for autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> | None |
| **[Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04763v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems are increasingly equipped with heterogeneous multimodal sensors, enabling richer perception but introducing modality-specific and agent-dependent uncertainty. Existing multi-agent collaboration frameworks typically reason at the agent level, assume homogeneous sensing, and handle uncertainty implicitly, limiting robustness under sensor corruption. We propose Active Asymmetric Multi-Agent Multimodal Learning under Uncertainty (A2MAML), a principled approach for uncertainty-aware, modality-level collaboration. A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities. Extensive experiments on connected autonomous driving scenarios for collaborative accident detection demonstrate that A2MAML consistently outperforms both single-agent and collaborative baselines, achieving up to 18.7% higher accident detection rate.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[DRMOT: A Dataset and Framework for RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04692v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Although cooperative perception has exceeded the detection capabilities of single-agent systems, prevalent camera-based algorithms in cooperative perception neglect valuable information derived from historical observations. This limitation becomes critical during sensor failures or communication issues as cooperative perception reverts to single-agent perception, leading to degraded performance and incomplete BEV segmentation maps. This paper introduces TempCoBEV, a temporal module designed to incorporate historical cues into current observations, thereby improving the quality and reliability of BEV map segmentations. We propose an importance-guided attention architecture to effectively integrate temporal information that prioritizes relevant properties for BEV map segmentation. TempCoBEV is an independent temporal module that seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art camera-based cooperative perception models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset that TempCoBEV performs better than non-temporal models in predicting current and future BEV map segmentations, particularly in scenarios involving communication failures. We show the efficacy of TempCoBEV and its capability to integrate historical cues into the current BEV map, improving predictions under optimal communication conditions by up to 2% and under communication failures by up to 19%.

This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> | None |

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to enhance the robustness and generalization of end-to-end driving models in diverse and unseen scenarios. However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance. Furthermore, we deploy AppleVLM on an AGV platform and successfully showcase real-world end-to-end autonomous driving in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[A Unified Candidate Set with Scene-Adaptive Refinement via Diffusion for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03112v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving is increasingly adopting a multimodal planning paradigm that generates multiple trajectory candidates and selects the final plan, making candidate-set design critical. A fixed trajectory vocabulary provides stable coverage in routine driving but often misses optimal solutions in complex interactions, while scene-adaptive refinement can cause over-correction in simple scenarios by unnecessarily perturbing already strong vocabulary trajectories.We propose CdDrive, which preserves the original vocabulary candidates and augments them with scene-adaptive candidates generated by vocabulary-conditioned diffusion denoising. Both candidate types are jointly scored by a shared selection module, enabling reliable performance across routine and highly interactive scenarios. We further introduce HATNA (Horizon-Aware Trajectory Noise Adapter) to improve the smoothness and geometric continuity of diffusion candidates via temporal smoothing and horizon-aware noise modulation. Experiments on NAVSIM v1 and NAVSIM v2 demonstrate leading performance, and ablations verify the contribution of each component.

However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a "good" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework. We release the evaluation prompts and scripts to establish a reproducible baseline for instruction-aware planning.

The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems has introduced critical safety concerns, particularly regarding driver re-engagement during mode transitions. Past accidents underscore the risks of overreliance on automation and highlight the need to understand dynamic attention allocation to support safety in autonomous driving. A high-fidelity driving simulation was conducted. Eye-tracking technology was used to measure fixation duration, fixation count, and time to first fixation across distinct driving modes (automated, manual, and transition), which were then used to assess how drivers allocated attention to various areas of interest (AOIs). Findings show that drivers' attention varies significantly across driving modes. In manual mode, attention consistently focuses on the road, while in automated mode, prolonged fixation on the embedded HMI was observed. During the handover and takeover phases, attention shifts dynamically between environmental and technological elements. The study reveals that driver attention allocation is mode-dependent. These findings inform the design of adaptive HMIs in AVs that align with drivers' attention patterns. By presenting relevant information according to the driving context, such systems can enhance driver-vehicle interaction, support effective transitions, and improve overall safety. Systematic analysis of visual attention dynamics across driving modes is gaining prominence, as it informs adaptive HMI designs and driver readiness interventions. The GLMM findings can be directly applied to the design of adaptive HMIs or driver training programs to enhance attention and improve safety.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

Our approach builds on pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) and introduces camera-aware register tokens that compress multi-camera features into a compact scene representation, significantly reducing downstream computation without sacrificing accuracy. These tokens drive two lightweight transformer decoders that generate and then score candidate trajectories. The scoring decoder learns to mimic an oracle and predicts interpretable sub-scores representing aspects such as safety, comfort, and efficiency, enabling behavior-conditioned driving at inference. Despite its minimal design, DrivoR outperforms or matches strong contemporary baselines across NAVSIM-v1, NAVSIM-v2, and the photorealistic closed-loop HUGSIM benchmark. Our results show that a pure-transformer architecture, combined with targeted token compression, is sufficient for accurate, efficient, and adaptive end-to-end driving.

This problem, equivalent to the NP-hard graph coloring problem, directly impacts real-time applications such as autonomous driving and industrial IoT, where minimizing channel estimation time is crucial. This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup. This significant improvement of PK-means GA in execution speed makes it highly suitable for low-latency real-time wireless networks (6G)</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Multi-Player, Multi-Strategy Quantum Game Model for Interaction-Aware Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03571v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although significant progress has been made in decision-making for automated driving, challenges remain for deployment in the real world. One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate QGDM in simulation across various scenarios, including roundabouts, merging, and highways, and compare its performance with multiple baseline methods. Results show that QGDM significantly improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical approaches, particularly in scenarios with high interaction.</p></details> |  | None |

While deep learning-based solutions have demonstrated impressive 3D MOT performance, model-based approaches remain appealing for their simplicity, interpretability, and data efficiency. Conventional model-based trackers typically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the tracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic data association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set (RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a theoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning. In this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs an optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several key innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a measurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track initialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively maintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track extraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior tracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing a new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for future research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

HetroD targets the critical challenge of navi- gating real-world heterogeneous traffic dominated by vulner- able road users (VRUs), including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists that interact with vehicles. These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

Prediction models forecast surrounding agent motion under unknown intentions, producing multimodal distributions, while planning assumes known ego objectives and generates deterministic trajectories. This mismatch creates a critical bottleneck: prediction lacks supervision for agent intentions, while planning requires this information. Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer.

Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

These challenges include the difficulty in accommodating the multi-modal nature of trajectories, the limitations of single expert model in managing diverse scenarios, and insufficient consideration of environmental interactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces the EMoE-Planner, which incorporates three innovative approaches. Firstly, the Explicit MoE (Mixture of Experts) dynamically selects specialized experts based on scenario-specific information through a shared scene router. Secondly, the planner utilizes scene-specific queries to provide multi-modal priors, directing the model's focus towards relevant target areas. Lastly, it enhances the prediction model and loss calculation by considering the interactions between the ego vehicle and other agents, thereby significantly boosting planning performance. Comparative experiments were conducted on the Nuplan dataset against the state-of-the-art methods. The simulation results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms SOTA models across nearly all test scenarios.

While world models offer a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving videos, they struggle to maintain instance-level temporal consistency and spatial geometric fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose InstaDrive, a novel framework that enhances driving video realism through two key advancements: (1) Instance Flow Guider, which extracts and propagates instance features across frames to enforce temporal consistency, preserving instance identity over time. (2) Spatial Geometric Aligner, which improves spatial reasoning, ensures precise instance positioning, and explicitly models occlusion hierarchies. By incorporating these instance-aware mechanisms, InstaDrive achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality and enhances downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity.

Current SD-map-based approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g., OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Hence, estimating 3D poses of all nearby humans, tracking their movements over time, and understanding their activities within social and environmental contexts are essential for many applications, such as autonomous driving, robot perception, robot navigation, and human-robot interaction. However, most existing 3D human pose estimation datasets primarily focus on single-person scenes or are collected in controlled laboratory environments, which restricts their relevance to real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce JRDB-Pose3D, which captures multi-human indoor and outdoor environments from a mobile robotic platform. JRDB-Pose3D provides rich 3D human pose annotations for such complex and dynamic scenes, including SMPL-based pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time. JRDB-Pose3D contains, on average, 5-10 human poses per frame, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously. The proposed dataset presents unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts, which closely reflect real-world environments. Moreover, JRDB-Pose3D inherits all available annotations from the JRDB dataset, such as 2D pose, information about social grouping, activities, and interactions, full-scene semantic masks with consistent human- and object-level tracking, and detailed annotations for each individual, such as age, gender, and race, making it a holistic dataset for a wide range of downstream perception and human-centric understanding tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

To address this, we introduce FastDriveCoT, a novel parallel decoding method that accelerates template-structured CoT. Our approach decomposes the reasoning process into a dependency graph of distinct sub-tasks, such as identifying critical objects and summarizing traffic rules, some of which can be generated in parallel. By generating multiple independent reasoning steps concurrently within a single forward pass, we significantly reduce the number of sequential computations. Experiments demonstrate a 3-4$\times$ speedup in CoT generation and a substantial reduction in end-to-end latency across various model architectures, all while preserving the original downstream task improvements brought by incorporating CoT reasoning.</p></details> |  | None |

Scene completion methods can infer the missing parts of incomplete 3D LiDAR scenes. Recent methods adopt local point-level denoising diffusion probabilistic models, which require predicting Gaussian noise, leading to a mismatch between training and inference initial distributions. This paper introduces the first flow matching framework for 3D LiDAR scene completion, improving upon diffusion-based methods by ensuring consistent initial distributions between training and inference. The model employs a nearest neighbor flow matching loss and a Chamfer distance loss to enhance both local structure and global coverage in the alignment of point clouds.

However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on single-modality generation, typically focusing on either multi-camera video or LiDAR sequence synthesis. In this paper, we propose UniDriveDreamer, a single-stage unified multimodal world model for autonomous driving, which directly generates multimodal future observations without relying on intermediate representations or cascaded modules. Our framework introduces a LiDAR-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to encode input LiDAR sequences, alongside a video VAE for multi-camera images. To ensure cross-modal compatibility and training stability, we propose Unified Latent Anchoring (ULA), which explicitly aligns the latent distributions of the two modalities. The aligned features are fused and processed by a diffusion transformer that jointly models their geometric correspondence and temporal evolution. Additionally, structured scene layout information is projected per modality as a conditioning signal to guide the synthesis.

Although recent frameworks such as RIFT have partially addressed these issues through group-relative optimization, their forward simulation procedures remain largely non-reactive, leading to unrealistic agent interactions within the virtual domain and ultimately limiting simulation fidelity. To address these issues, we propose ForSim, a stepwise closed-loop forward simulation paradigm. At each virtual timestep, the traffic agent propagates the virtual candidate trajectory that best spatiotemporally matches the reference trajectory through physically grounded motion dynamics, thereby preserving multimodal behavioral diversity while ensuring intra-modality consistency. Other agents are updated with stepwise predictions, yielding coherent and interaction-aware evolution. When incorporated into the RIFT traffic simulation framework, ForSim operates in conjunction with group-relative optimization to fine-tune traffic policy. Extensive experiments confirm that this integration consistently improves safety while maintaining efficiency, realism, and comfort. These results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop multimodal interactions within forward simulation and enhance the fidelity and reliability of traffic simulation for autonomous driving.

However, existing methods struggle to balance precision and efficiency: high-accuracy approaches are often hindered by heavy computational overhead, leading to slow inference speeds, while others leverage pure bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations to gain speed at the cost of losing vertical spatial cues and compromising geometric integrity. To overcome these limitations, we build on the efficient Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm and propose a pure 2D framework, DA-Occ, for 3D occupancy prediction that preserves fine-grained geometry. Standard LSS-based methods lift 2D features into 3D space solely based on depth scores, making it difficult to fully capture vertical structure. To improve upon this, DA-Occ augments depth-based lifting with a complementary height-score projection that explicitly encodes vertical geometric information. We further employ direction-aware convolution to extract geometric features along both vertical and horizontal orientations, effectively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Although optimized with a fully differentiable framework in a planning-oriented manner, existing end-to-end driving systems lacking ego-centric designs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance and inferior efficiency, due to rasterized scene representation learning and redundant information transmission. In this paper, we propose an ego-centric fully sparse paradigm, named EgoFSD, for end-to-end self-driving. Specifically, EgoFSD consists of sparse perception, hierarchical interaction and iterative motion planner. The sparse perception module performs detection and online mapping based on sparse representation of the driving scene. The hierarchical interaction module aims to select the Closest In-Path Vehicle / Stationary (CIPV / CIPS) from coarse to fine, benefiting from an additional geometric prior. As for the iterative motion planner, both selected interactive agents and ego-vehicle are considered for joint motion prediction, where the output multi-modal ego-trajectories are optimized in an iterative fashion. In addition, position-level motion diffusion and trajectory-level planning denoising are introduced for uncertainty modeling, thereby enhancing the training stability and convergence speed. Extensive experiments are conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets, which significantly reduces the average L2 error by 59% and collision rate by 92% than UniAD while achieves 6.9x faster running efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted to ICRA2026 | None |

We present UniDWM, a unified driving world model that advances autonomous driving through multifaceted representation learning. UniDWM constructs a structure- and dynamic-aware latent world representation that serves as a physically grounded state space, enabling consistent reasoning across perception, prediction, and planning. Specifically, a joint reconstruction pathway learns to recover the scene's structure, including geometry and visual texture, while a collaborative generation framework leverages a conditional diffusion transformer to forecast future world evolution within the latent space. Furthermore, we show that our UniDWM can be deemed as a variation of VAE, which provides theoretical guidance for the multifaceted representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of UniDWM in trajectory planning, 4D reconstruction and generation, highlighting the potential of multifaceted world representations as a foundation for unified driving intelligence.

| **[Dichotomous Diffusion Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00898v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based policies have gained growing popularity in solving a wide range of decision-making tasks due to their superior expressiveness and controllable generation during inference. However, effectively training large diffusion policies using reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from unstable training due to directly maximizing value objectives, or face computational issues due to relying on crude Gaussian likelihood approximation, which requires a large amount of sufficiently small denoising steps. In this work, we propose DIPOLE (Dichotomous diffusion Policy improvement), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and controllable diffusion policy optimization. We begin by revisiting the KL-regularized objective in RL, which offers a desirable weighted regression objective for diffusion policy extraction, but often struggles to balance greediness and stability. We then formulate a greedified policy regularization scheme, which naturally enables decomposing the optimal policy into a pair of stably learned dichotomous policies: one aims at reward maximization, and the other focuses on reward minimization. Under such a design, optimized actions can be generated by linearly combining the scores of dichotomous policies during inference, thereby enabling flexible control over the level of greediness.Evaluations in offline and offline-to-online RL settings on ExORL and OGBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also use DIPOLE to train a large vision-language-action (VLA) model for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) and evaluate it on the large-scale real-world AD benchmark NAVSIM, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.</p></details> |  | None |

We leverage the fact that relative depth preserves global layout and boundaries: by calibrating it with sparse range measurements, we transform it into a pseudo metric depth prior. Building on this prior, we design a refinement network that follows the prior where reliable and deviates where necessary, enabling accurate metric predictions from very few labeled samples. The resulting system is particularly effective when curated validation data are unavailable, sustaining stable scale and sharp edges across few-shot regimes. These findings suggest that coupling foundation priors with sparse anchors is a practical route to robust, deployment-ready depth completion under real-world label scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2026</p></details> | None |

Most existing methods employ a spatial propagation network to iteratively refine the depth map after obtaining an initial dense depth. In this paper, we propose DenseFormer, a novel method that integrates the diffusion model into the depth completion task. By incorporating the denoising mechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by progressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple iterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature pyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively extract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which serve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this paper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative refinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the diffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale information and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the predicted depth map. Extensive experiments on the KITTI outdoor scene dataset demonstrate that DenseFormer outperforms classical depth completion methods.</p></details> |  | None |

These challenges are particularly prominent in long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios, where autonomous vehicles must interact with heterogeneous road users, including human-driven vehicles and vulnerable road users, under complex and uncertain conditions. This paper proposes HERMES, a holistic risk-aware end-to-end multimodal driving framework designed to inject explicit long-tail risk cues into trajectory planning. HERMES employs a foundation-model-assisted annotation pipeline to produce structured Long-Tail Scene Context and Long-Tail Planning Context, capturing hazard-centric cues together with maneuver intent and safety preference, and uses these signals to guide end-to-end planning. HERMES further introduces a Tri-Modal Driving Module that fuses multi-view perception, historical motion cues, and semantic guidance, ensuring risk-aware accurate trajectory planning under long-tail scenarios. Experiments on the real-world long-tail dataset demonstrate that HERMES consistently outperforms representative end-to-end and VLM-driven baselines under long-tail mixed-traffic scenarios.

We introduce Versatile Behavior Diffusion (VBD), a novel traffic scenario generation framework based on diffusion generative models that synthesizes scene-consistent, realistic, and controllable multi-agent interactions. VBD achieves strong performance in closed-loop traffic simulation, generating scene-consistent agent behaviors that reflect complex agent interactions. A key capability of VBD is inference-time scenario editing through multi-step refinement, guided by behavior priors and model-based optimization objectives, enabling flexible and controllable behavior generation. Despite being trained on real-world traffic datasets with only normal conditions, we introduce conflict-prior and game-theoretic guidance approaches. These approaches enable the generation of interactive, customizable, or long-tail safety-critical scenarios, which are essential for comprehensive testing and validation of autonomous driving systems. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of VBD and highlight its promise as a foundational tool for advancing traffic simulation and autonomous vehicle development.

This paper proposes a graph-based framework for coverage analysis that represents traffic scenes as hierarchical graphs, combining map topology with actor relationships. The framework introduces a two-phase graph construction algorithm that systematically captures spatial relationships between traffic participants, including leading, following, neighboring, and opposing configurations. Two complementary coverage analysis methods are presented. First, a sub-graph isomorphism approach matches traffic scenes against a set of manually defined archetype graphs representing common driving scenarios. Second, a graph embedding approach utilizes Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE) trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to project traffic scenes into a vector space, enabling similarity-based coverage assessment. The framework is validated on both real-world data from the Argoverse 2.0 dataset and synthetic data from the CARLA simulator. The subgraph isomorphism method is used to calculate node coverage percentages using predefined archetypes, while the embedding approach reveals meaningful structure in the latent space suitable for clustering and anomaly detection. The proposed approach offers significant advantages over traditional methods by scaling efficiently to diverse traffic scenarios without requiring scenario-specific handling, and by naturally accommodating varying numbers of actors in a scene.</p></details> |  | None |

Conventional methods typically address these tasks independently, rely on single-camera setups, and often require additional 3D semantic or pose priors, while lacking mechanisms to quantify the confidence of localization results, making them less feasible for real industrial applications. In this paper, we propose VVLoc, a unified pipeline that employs a single neural network to concurrently achieve topological and metric vehicle localization using multi-camera system. VVLoc first evaluates the geo-proximity between visual observations, then estimates their relative metric poses using a matching strategy, while also providing a confidence measure. Additionally, the training process for VVLoc is highly efficient, requiring only pairs of visual data and corresponding ground-truth poses, eliminating the need for complex supplementary data.

While often addressed in isolation due to their differing objectives, such as generating diverse motion states or estimating optimal trajectories, these tasks inherently depend on shared capabilities: understanding multi-agent interactions, modeling motion behaviors, and reasoning over temporal and spatial dynamics. Despite this underlying commonality, existing approaches typically adopt specialized model designs, which hinders cross-task generalization and system scalability. More critically, this separation overlooks the potential mutual benefits among tasks. Motivated by these observations, we propose UniMotion, a unified motion framework that captures shared structures across motion tasks while accommodating their individual requirements. Built on a decoder-only Transformer architecture, UniMotion employs dedicated interaction modes and tailored training strategies to simultaneously support these motion tasks. This unified design not only enables joint optimization and representation sharing but also allows for targeted fine-tuning to specialize in individual tasks when needed. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that joint training leads to robust generalization and effective task integration.

It enables the vehicle to perceive and understand its environment by identifying and locating various objects around it. By utilizing advanced imaging and deep learning techniques, autonomous vehicle systems can rapidly and accurately identify objects based on their features. Different deep learning methods vary in their ability to accurately detect and classify objects in autonomous vehicle systems. Selecting the appropriate method significantly impacts system performance, robustness, and efficiency in real-world driving scenarios. While several generic deep learning architectures like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN have been proposed, guidance on their suitability for specific autonomous driving applications is often limited. The choice of method affects detection accuracy, processing speed, environmental robustness, sensor integration, scalability, and edge case handling. This study provides a comprehensive experimental analysis comparing two prominent object detection models: YOLOv5 (a one-stage detector) and Faster R-CNN (a two-stage detector). Their performance is evaluated on a diverse dataset combining real and synthetic images, considering various metrics including mean Average Precision (mAP), recall, and inference speed. The findings reveal that YOLOv5 demonstrates superior performance in terms of mAP, recall, and training efficiency, particularly as dataset size and image resolution increase. However, Faster R-CNN shows advantages in detecting small, distant objects and performs well in challenging lighting conditions. The models' behavior is also analyzed under different confidence thresholds and in various real-world scenarios, providing insights into their applicability for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation. By applying the proposed approach, the agent not only drives in lane but also handles unsafe conditions at an expert level, increasing robustness.We make our code publicly available.</p></details> |  | None |

Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.</p></details> |  | None |

Integrating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in addressing "long-tail" scenarios.

To overcome this limitation, we present MTDrive, a multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to iteratively refine trajectories based on environmental feedback. MTDrive introduces Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (mtGRPO), which mitigates reward sparsity by computing relative advantages across turns.

Effective model training requires not only large quantities of sensor data but also balanced coverage that includes rare yet safety-critical scenarios. Capturing such events demands extensive driving time and efficient selection. This paper introduces the Lambda framework, an edge-native platform that enables on-vehicle data filtering and processing through user-defined functions. The framework provides a serverless-inspired abstraction layer that separates application logic from low-level execution concerns such as scheduling, deployment, and isolation. By adapting Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) principles to resource-constrained automotive environments, it allows developers to implement modular, event-driven filtering algorithms while maintaining compatibility with ROS 2 and existing data recording pipelines. We evaluate the framework on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and compare it against native ROS 2 deployments. Results show competitive performance, reduced latency and jitter, and confirm that lambda-based abstractions can support real-time data processing in embedded autonomous driving systems.

While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> |  | None |

This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing multi-modal frameworks often struggle with modality heterogeneity, spatial misalignment, and the representation crisis--where voxels are computationally heavy and BEV alternatives are lossy. We present GaussianOcc3D, a multi-modal framework bridging camera and LiDAR through a memory-efficient, continuous 3D Gaussian representation. We introduce four modules: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), using depth-wise deformable sampling to lift sparse signals onto Gaussian primitives; (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing (EBFS) to mitigate domain noise; (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion (ACLF) with uncertainty-aware reweighting for sensor reliability; and (4) a Gauss-Mamba Head leveraging Selective State Space Models for global context with linear complexity. Evaluations on Occ3D, SurroundOcc, and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mIoU scores of 49.4%, 28.9%, and 25.2% respectively. GaussianOcc3D exhibits superior robustness across challenging rainy and nighttime conditions.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12142v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.</p></details> | Accepted by IV | None |

We introduce FlexMap, unlike prior methods that are fixed to a specific N-camera rig, our approach adapts to variable camera configurations without any architectural changes or per-configuration retraining. Our key innovation eliminates explicit geometric projections by using a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding in feature space. FlexMap features two core components: a spatial-temporal enhancement module that separates cross-view spatial reasoning from temporal dynamics, and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, enabling view-adaptive attention without the need for projection matrices. Experiments demonstrate that FlexMap outperforms existing methods across multiple configurations while maintaining robustness to missing views and sensor variations, enabling more practical real-world deployment.</p></details> |  | None |

In practice, safety requirements are heterogeneous and admit only partial priority relations, where some constraints are comparable while others are inherently incomparable. We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction. Experiments on multi-obstacle navigation, constrained robot manipulation, and vision-based autonomous driving demonstrate improved feasibility, robustness, and scalability over unstructured and differentiable quadratic program-based safety layers.</p></details> |  | None |

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  | None |

These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project's code can be found at https://github.com/flowersteam/WorldLLM.

Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.</p></details> |  | None |

This paper investigates a novel threat: Semantic-Aware Hijacking. We explore the feasibility of hijacking multiple stateless decisions simultaneously using a single universal perturbation. We introduce the Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbation (SAUP), which acts as a semantic router, "actively" perceiving input semantics and routing them to distinct, attacker-defined targets. To achieve this, we conduct theoretical and empirical analysis on the geometric properties in the latent space. Guided by these insights, we propose the Semantic-Oriented (SORT) optimization strategy and annotate a new dataset with fine-grained semantics to evaluate performance. Extensive experiments on three representative MLLMs demonstrate the fundamental feasibility of this attack, achieving a 66% attack success rate over five targets using a single frame against Qwen.</p></details> |  | None |

A Mechanism Explanation Based on Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14539v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of external human-machine interface (EHMI) on autonomous vehicles (AVs) facilitates information exchange. Existing research fails to consider the impact of the sequence of actions, as well as the effects of EHMI applications and deception, raising the question of whether benevolent, well-intentioned deception should be permitted (i.e., misleading statements that are intended to benefit both parties). We established a game theory based EHMI information disclosure framework for AVs in this study. In considering benevolent deception, this framework divided the decision-making process into three stages, respectively encompassing three key questions: whether to disclose, when to disclose, and what type of intention information to disclose. The results show that theoretical advantages of deception exist in certain cases when AV expects to maximize the safety of the interaction. In 40 out of 484 cases (8.3%), safety can be enhanced through successful deception. Those successful deceptions fall into two categories: 1) In 28 of these cases, the straight-going AV expected the left-turning human-driven vehicle (HV) to yield, while HV exhibited lower speed and higher acceleration; 2) In 12 of these cases, AV expected HV to proceed first, while HV exhibited higher speed and lower acceleration. We also conducted a VR-based driving simulation experiment, and the results confirmed our conclusion. Additionally, we found that when participants had low trust in the EHMI, its use negatively impacted interaction efficiency instead. This study serves as an exploratory behavioral mechanism study based on specific hypotheses for future EHMI design and ethical decision-making of autonomous driving system.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> | None |

Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 23 pages, 14 figures</p></details> | None |

To evaluate such capabilities of current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35 atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model, GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements.

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms). These results indicate that query-space, fully differentiable camera-LiDAR fusion can increase robustness of end-to-end PnP without sacrificing deployability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> | None |

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

However, many existing methods involve trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Some achieve high precision but with slow inference speed, while others adopt purely bird's-eye-view (BEV)-based 2D representations to accelerate processing, inevitably sacrificing vertical cues and compromising geometric integrity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pure 2D framework that achieves efficient 3D occupancy prediction while preserving geometric integrity. Unlike conventional Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) methods that rely solely on depth scores to lift 2D features into 3D space, our approach additionally introduces a height-score projection to encode vertical geometric structure. We further employ direction-aware convolution to extract geometric features along both vertical and horizontal orientations, effectively balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3\% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Traditional rule-based metrics like Time-to-Collision are too simplistic to capture complex interaction risks, and existing methods lack a systematic way to verify whether statistical anomalies truly reflect physical danger. To address this gap, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on a multi-agent Transformer that models normal driving and measures deviations through prediction residuals. A dual evaluation scheme has been proposed to assess both detection stability and physical alignment: Stability is measured using standard ranking metrics in which Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient captures rank agreement and Jaccard index captures the consistency of the top-K selected items; Physical alignment is assessed through correlations with established Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM). Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness: We show that the maximum residual aggregator achieves the highest physical alignment while maintaining stability. Furthermore, our framework identifies 388 unique anomalies missed by Time-to-Collision and statistical baselines, capturing subtle multi-agent risks like reactive braking under lateral drift. The detected anomalies are further clustered into four interpretable risk types, offering actionable insights for simulation and testing.</p></details> |  | None |

AI systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks (e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets, protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a model server.</p></details> |  | None |

We introduce IBR-GCS, an Iterative Best Response (IBR) planning approach based on the Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) framework that models highway driving as a generalized noncooperative game. IBR-GCS integrates combinatorial maneuver reasoning, trajectory planning, and game-theoretic interaction within a unified framework. The key novelty is a vehicle-specific, strategy-dependent GCS construction. Specifically, at each best-response update, each vehicle builds its own graph conditioned on the current strategies of the other vehicles, with vertices representing lane-specific, time-varying, convex, collision-free regions and edges encoding dynamically feasible transitions. This yields a shortest-path problem in GCS for each best-response step, which admits an efficient convex relaxation that can be solved using convex optimization tools without exhaustive discrete tree search. We then apply an iterative best-response scheme in which vehicles update their trajectories sequentially and provide conditions under which the resulting inexact updates converge to an approximate generalized Nash equilibrium. Simulation results across multi-lane, multi-vehicle scenarios demonstrate that IBR-GCS produces safe trajectories and strategically consistent interactive behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages for content, 2 pages for references, 2 pages for notation</p></details> | None |

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.</p></details> | Accepted to IPMV2026 | None |

However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2026.

This study establishes that temporal perception buffers and cost-efficient high-definition (HD) maps inherently form complementary prior sources for online vectorized HD map construction. We present Uni-PrevPredMap, a pioneering unified framework systematically integrating previous predictions with corrupted HD maps. Our framework introduces a tri-mode paradigm maintaining operational consistency across non-prior, temporal-prior, and temporal-map-fusion modes. This tri-mode paradigm simultaneously decouples the framework from ideal map assumptions while ensuring robust performance in both map-present and map-absent scenarios. Additionally, we develop a tile-indexed 3D vectorized global map processor enabling efficient 3D prior data refreshment, compact storage, and real-time retrieval. Uni-PrevPredMap achieves state-of-the-art map-absent performance across established online vectorized HD map construction benchmarks. When provided with corrupted HD maps, it exhibits robust capabilities in error-resilient prior fusion, empirically confirming the synergistic complementarity between temporal predictions and imperfect map data.

This study introduces an empirical learning framework that derives these trade-offs directly from naturalistic trajectory data. A unified objective space represents each AV timestep through composite scores of safety, efficiency, and interaction. Pareto dominance is applied to identify non-dominated states, forming an empirical frontier that defines the attainable region of balanced performance. The proposed framework was demonstrated using the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) datasets from Foggy Bottom and I-395. Results showed that only 0.23\% of AV driving instances were Pareto-optimal, underscoring the rarity of simultaneous optimization across objectives. Pareto-optimal states showed notably higher mean scores for safety, efficiency, and interaction compared to non-optimal cases, with interaction showing the greatest potential for improvement. This minimally invasive and modular framework, which requires only kinematic and positional data, can be directly applied beyond the scope of this study to derive and visualize multi-objective learning surfaces</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation/publication at the The IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium of 2026 (IEEE IV 2026)</p></details> | None |

To avoid the difficulty of modeling highly complex dynamics and ensuring realtime control feasibility and performance, this work uses deep reinforcement learning with a model predictive controller in a cooperative framework to handle unknown dynamics. The model-based controller takes on the primary role as both controllers are provided with predictive information about the other. This improves tracking performance and retention of inherent robustness of the model predictive controller. We evaluate this framework for off-road autonomous driving on unknown deformable terrains that represent sandy deformable soil, sandy and rocky soil, and cohesive clay-like deformable soil. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers by upto 29.2% and 10.2%. This framework generalized well over varied and previously unseen terrain characteristics to track longitudinal reference speeds with lower errors. Furthermore, this required significantly less training data compared to purely learning-based controller, while delivering better performance even when under-trained.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Accepted at 2025 IEEE ICRA</p></details> | None |

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> | None |

Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p></details> | accepted by ICLR | None |

This paper presents a conceptual framework for integrating Transformers into automotive systems from a safety perspective. We outline how multimodal Foundation Models can leverage sensor diversity and redundancy to improve fault tolerance and robustness. Our proposed architecture combines multiple independent modality-specific encoders that fuse their representations into a shared latent space, supporting fail-operational behavior if one modality degrades. We demonstrate how different input modalities could be fused in order to maintain consistent scene understanding. By structurally embedding redundancy and diversity at the representational level, this approach bridges the gap between modern deep learning and established functional safety practices, paving the way for certifiable AI systems in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

While numerous defogging methods exist, from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models, improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, raising concerns about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of defogging pipelines, including classical dehazing filters, modern defogging networks, chained variants combining filters and models, and prompt-driven visual language image editing models applied directly to foggy images. To bridge the gap between simulated and physical environments, we evaluate these pipelines on both the synthetic Foggy Cityscapes dataset and the real-world Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We examine generalization by evaluating performance on synthetic fog and real-world conditions, assessing both image quality and downstream perception in terms of object detection mean average precision and segmentation panoptic quality. Our analysis identifies when defogging is effective, the impact of combining models, and how visual language models compare to traditional approaches. We additionally report qualitative rubric-based evaluations from both human and visual language model judges and analyze their alignment with downstream task metrics. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and identify the conditions under which pre-processing meaningfully improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.

Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions.

Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a major obstacle to model generalization. To address this challenge from a data-centric perspective, this paper introduces a profile extraction and discovery framework for characterizing the style profiles underlying both synthetic and real image datasets. We propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized profiling-based quality control paradigm that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2026 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IEEE IV 2026)</p></details> | None |
| **[Masked Depth Modeling for Spatial Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17895v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial visual perception is a fundamental requirement in physical-world applications like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation, driven by the need to interact with 3D environments. Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as "masked" signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, a depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage. Experimental results on a range of downstream tasks further suggest that LingBot-Depth offers an aligned latent representation across RGB and depth modalities. We release the code, checkpoint, and 3M RGB-depth pairs (including 2M real data and 1M simulated data) to the community of spatial perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report, 19 pages, 15 figures and 4 tables</p></details> | None |

While Offline Reinforcement Learning enables training autonomous vehicles with such data, most available datasets lack meaningful reward labels. Reward labeling is essential as it provides feedback for the learning algorithm to distinguish between desirable and undesirable behaviors, thereby improving policy performance. This paper presents a novel approach for generating human-aligned reward labels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of absent reward signals in the real-world datasets by generating labels that reflect human judgment and safety considerations. The reward function incorporates an adaptive safety component that is activated by analyzing semantic segmentation maps, enabling the autonomous vehicle to prioritize safety over efficiency in potential collision scenarios. The proposed method is applied to an occluded pedestrian crossing scenario with varying pedestrian traffic levels, using simulation data. When the generated rewards were used to train various Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithms, each model produced a meaningful policy, demonstrating the method's viability. In addition, the method was applied to a subset of the Audi Autonomous Driving Dataset, and the reward labels were compared to human-annotated reward labels. The findings show a moderate disparity between the two reward sets, and, most interestingly, the method flagged unsafe states that the human annotator missed.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

We propose PocketDVDNet, a lightweight video denoiser developed using our model compression framework that combines sparsity-guided structured pruning, a physics-informed noise model, and knowledge distillation to achieve high-quality restoration with reduced resource demands. Starting from a reference model, we induce sparsity, apply targeted channel pruning, and retrain a teacher on realistic multi-component noise. The student network learns implicit noise handling, eliminating the need for explicit noise-map inputs. PocketDVDNet reduces the original model size by 74% while improving denoising quality and processing 5-frame patches in real-time. These results demonstrate that aggressive compression, combined with domain-adapted distillation, can reconcile performance and efficiency for practical, real-time video denoising.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[UACER: An Uncertainty-Adaptive Critic Ensemble Framework for Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10492v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust adversarial reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training agents to handle uncertain disturbance in real environments, with critical applications in sequential decision-making domains such as autonomous driving and robotic control. Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Adaptive Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two components: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: A diverse set of K critic networks is employed in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation in robust adversarial reinforcement learning, reducing variance and enhancing robustness compared to conventional single-critic designs. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: Moving beyond simple linear combinations, we propose a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to adaptively regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while stabilizing the training process. Comprehensive experiments across several challenging MuJoCo control problems validate the superior effectiveness of UACER, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance, stability, and efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing methods often struggle to filter redundant scene data for discriminative information extraction, directly impairing trajectory prediction accuracy especially when handling outliers and dynamic multi-agent interactions. In response to these limitations, we present a novel map-free trajectory prediction method which adaptively eliminates redundant information and selects discriminative features across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains, thereby enabling precise trajectory prediction in real-world driving environments. First, we design a MoE based frequency domain filter to adaptively weight distinct frequency components of observed trajectory data and suppress outlier related noise; then a selective spatiotemporal attention module that reallocates weights across temporal nodes (sequential dependencies), temporal trends (evolution patterns), and spatial nodes to extract salient information is proposed. Finally, our multimodal decoder-supervised by joint patch level and point-level losses generates reasonable and temporally consistent trajectories, and comprehensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and low-latency inference performance compared with recently proposed methods.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves competitive performance with only 10\% of voxel annotations on the SemanticKITTI and Occ3D-nuScenes datasets.

While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we propose an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation approach where a 3D segmentation model is trained on the target dataset using pseudo-labels generated by a novel multi-view projection framework. Our approach first aligns Lidar scans into coherent 3D scenes and renders them from multiple virtual camera poses to create large-scale synthetic 2D semantic segmentation datasets in various modalities. The generated datasets are used to train an ensemble of 2D segmentation models in point cloud view domain on each modality. During inference, the models process a large amount of views per scene; the resulting logits are back-projected to 3D with a depth-aware voting scheme to generate final point-wise labels. These labels are then used to fine-tune a 3D segmentation model in the target domain. We evaluate our approach Real-to-Real on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets. We also evaluate it Simulation-to-Real with the SynLidar dataset. Our contributions are a novel method that achieves state-of-the-art results in Real-to-Real Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, and we also demonstrate an application of our method to segment rare classes, for which target 3D annotations are not available, by only using 2D annotations for those classes and leveraging 3D annotations for other classes in a source domain.</p></details> |  | None |
