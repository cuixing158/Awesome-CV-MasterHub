| **[UncAD: Towards Safe End-to-end Autonomous Driving via Online Map Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12826v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving aims to produce planning trajectories from raw sensors directly. Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction, and planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great scalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of online maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle planning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further compromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance of online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a novel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty of the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty to guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal trajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an uncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online map uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we incorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a 1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and drivable area conflict rate by up to 42%.

| **[Explainable Scene Understanding with Qualitative Representations and Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12817v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the integration of graph neural networks (GNNs) with Qualitative Explainable Graphs (QXGs) for scene understanding in automated driving. Scene understanding is the basis for any further reactive or proactive decision-making. Scene understanding and related reasoning is inherently an explanation task: why is another traffic participant doing something, what or who caused their actions? While previous work demonstrated QXGs' effectiveness using shallow machine learning models, these approaches were limited to analysing single relation chains between object pairs, disregarding the broader scene context. We propose a novel GNN architecture that processes entire graph structures to identify relevant objects in traffic scenes. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset enriched with DriveLM's human-annotated relevance labels. Experimental results show that our GNN-based approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods. The model effectively handles the inherent class imbalance in relevant object identification tasks while considering the complete spatial-temporal relationships between all objects in the scene. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining qualitative representations with deep learning approaches for explainable scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop "Advancing Automated Driving in Highly Interactive Scenarios through Behavior Prediction, Trustworthy AI, and Remote Operations" @ 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> | None |
| **[Approaching Current Challenges in Developing a Software Stack for Fully Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12813v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving is a complex undertaking. A common approach is to break down the driving task into individual subtasks through modularization. These sub-modules are usually developed and published separately. However, if these individually developed algorithms have to be combined again to form a full-stack autonomous driving software, this poses particular challenges. Drawing upon our practical experience in developing the software of TUM Autonomous Motorsport, we have identified and derived these challenges in developing an autonomous driving software stack within a scientific environment. We do not focus on the specific challenges of individual algorithms but on the general difficulties that arise when deploying research algorithms on real-world test vehicles. To overcome these challenges, we introduce strategies that have been effective in our development approach. We additionally provide open-source implementations that enable these concepts on GitHub. As a result, this paper's contributions will simplify future full-stack autonomous driving projects, which are essential for a thorough evaluation of the individual algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE IV 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Online Video Understanding: OVBench and VideoChat-Online](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00584v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly progressed in offline video understanding. However, applying these models to real-world scenarios, such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, presents unique challenges due to the need for real-time processing of continuous online video streams. To this end, this paper presents systematic efforts from three perspectives: evaluation benchmark, model architecture, and training strategy. First, we introduce OVBench, a comprehensive question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to perceive, memorize, and reason within online video contexts. It features 6 core task types across three temporal contexts-past, current, and future-forming 16 subtasks from diverse datasets. Second, we propose a new Pyramid Memory Bank (PMB) that effectively retains key spatiotemporal information in video streams. Third, we proposed an offline-to-online learning paradigm, designing an interleaved dialogue format for online video data and constructing an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for online video training. This framework led to the development of VideoChat-Online, a robust and efficient model for online video understanding. Despite the lower computational cost and higher efficiency, VideoChat-Online outperforms existing state-of-the-art offline and online models across popular offline video benchmarks and OVBench, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model architecture and training strategy. % Our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art offline models Qwen2-VL 7B and online models Flash-VStream, by 4.19% and 23.7% on OVBench, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera Ready Version.

| **[Self-Supervised Pre-training with Combined Datasets for 3D Perception in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12709v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The significant achievements of pre-trained models leveraging large volumes of data in the field of NLP and 2D vision inspire us to explore the potential of extensive data pre-training for 3D perception in autonomous driving. Toward this goal, this paper proposes to utilize massive unlabeled data from heterogeneous datasets to pre-train 3D perception models. We introduce a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns effective 3D representations from scratch on unlabeled data, combined with a prompt adapter based domain adaptation strategy to reduce dataset bias. The approach significantly improves model performance on downstream tasks such as 3D object detection, BEV segmentation, 3D object tracking, and occupancy prediction, and shows steady performance increase as the training data volume scales up, demonstrating the potential of continually benefit 3D perception models for autonomous driving. We will release the source code to inspire further investigations in the community.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Collaborative Perception Datasets for Autonomous Driving: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12696v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception has attracted growing interest from academia and industry due to its potential to enhance perception accuracy, safety, and robustness in autonomous driving through multi-agent information fusion. With the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, numerous collaborative perception datasets have emerged, varying in cooperation paradigms, sensor configurations, data sources, and application scenarios. However, the absence of systematic summarization and comparative analysis hinders effective resource utilization and standardization of model evaluation. As the first comprehensive review focused on collaborative perception datasets, this work reviews and compares existing resources from a multi-dimensional perspective. We categorize datasets based on cooperation paradigms, examine their data sources and scenarios, and analyze sensor modalities and supported tasks. A detailed comparative analysis is conducted across multiple dimensions. We also outline key challenges and future directions, including dataset scalability, diversity, domain adaptation, standardization, privacy, and the integration of large language models. To support ongoing research, we provide a continuously updated online repository of collaborative perception datasets and related literature: https://github.com/frankwnb/Collaborative-Perception-Datasets-for-Autonomous-Driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 7figures, journal</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/frankwnb/Collaborative-Perception-Datasets-for-Autonomous-Driving) |
| **[Two Tasks, One Goal: Uniting Motion and Planning for Excellent End To End Autonomous Driving Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12667v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving has made impressive progress in recent years. Former end-to-end autonomous driving approaches often decouple planning and motion tasks, treating them as separate modules. This separation overlooks the potential benefits that planning can gain from learning out-of-distribution data encountered in motion tasks. However, unifying these tasks poses significant challenges, such as constructing shared contextual representations and handling the unobservability of other vehicles' states. To address these challenges, we propose TTOG, a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework. In the first stage, a diverse set of trajectory candidates is generated, while the second stage focuses on refining these candidates through vehicle state information. To mitigate the issue of unavailable surrounding vehicle states, TTOG employs a self-vehicle data-trained state estimator, subsequently extended to other vehicles. Furthermore, we introduce ECSA (equivariant context-sharing scene adapter) to enhance the generalization of scene representations across different agents. Experimental results demonstrate that TTOG achieves state-of-the-art performance across both planning and motion tasks. Notably, on the challenging open-loop nuScenes dataset, TTOG reduces the L2 distance by 36.06\%. Furthermore, on the closed-loop Bench2Drive dataset, our approach achieves a 22\% improvement in the driving score (DS), significantly outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[CoDiff: Conditional Diffusion Model for Collaborative 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14891v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative 3D object detection holds significant importance in the field of autonomous driving, as it greatly enhances the perception capabilities of each individual agent by facilitating information exchange among multiple agents. However, in practice, due to pose estimation errors and time delays, the fusion of information across agents often results in feature representations with spatial and temporal noise, leading to detection errors. Diffusion models naturally have the ability to denoise noisy samples to the ideal data, which motivates us to explore the use of diffusion models to address the noise problem between multi-agent systems. In this work, we propose CoDiff, a novel robust collaborative perception framework that leverages the potential of diffusion models to generate more comprehensive and clearer feature representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply diffusion models to multi-agent collaborative perception. Specifically, we project high-dimensional feature map into the latent space of a powerful pre-trained autoencoder. Within this space, individual agent information serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model's sampling. This process denoises coarse feature maps and progressively refines the fused features. Experimental study on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework CoDiff consistently outperforms existing relevant methods in terms of the collaborative object detection performance, and exhibits highly desired robustness when the pose and delay information of agents is with high-level noise.

| **[Self-Supervised Traversability Learning with Online Prototype Adaptation for Off-Road Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12109v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving reliable and safe autonomous driving in off-road environments requires accurate and efficient terrain traversability analysis. However, this task faces several challenges, including the scarcity of large-scale datasets tailored for off-road scenarios, the high cost and potential errors of manual annotation, the stringent real-time requirements of motion planning, and the limited computational power of onboard units. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel traversability learning method that leverages self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for manual annotation. For the first time, a Birds-Eye View (BEV) representation is used as input, reducing computational burden and improving adaptability to downstream motion planning. During vehicle operation, the proposed method conducts online analysis of traversed regions and dynamically updates prototypes to adaptively assess the traversability of the current environment, effectively handling dynamic scene changes. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art benchmarks on both public datasets and our own dataset, covering diverse seasons and geographical locations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms recent approaches. Additionally, real-world vehicle experiments show that our method operates at 10 Hz, meeting real-time requirements, while a 5.5 km autonomous driving experiment further validates the generated traversability cost maps compatibility with downstream motion planning.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Contract-based hierarchical control using predictive feasibility value functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12036v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's control systems are often characterized by modularity and safety requirements to handle complexity, resulting in hierarchical control structures. Although hierarchical model predictive control offers favorable properties, achieving a provably safe, yet modular design remains a challenge. This paper introduces a contract-based hierarchical control strategy to improve the performance of control systems facing challenges related to model inconsistency and independent controller design across hierarchies. We consider a setup where a higher-level controller generates references that affect the constraints of a lower-level controller, which is based on a soft-constrained MPC formulation. The optimal slack variables serve as the basis for a contract that allows the higher-level controller to assess the feasibility of the reference trajectory without exact knowledge of the model, constraints, and cost of the lower-level controller. To ensure computational efficiency while maintaining model confidentiality, we propose using an explicit function approximation, such as a neural network, to represent the cost of optimal slack values. The approach is tested for a hierarchical control setup consisting of a planner and a motion controller as commonly found in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Agent Security Bench (ASB): Formalizing and Benchmarking Attacks and Defenses in LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02644v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLM-based agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), can use external tools and memory mechanisms to solve complex real-world tasks, they may also introduce critical security vulnerabilities. However, the existing literature does not comprehensively evaluate attacks and defenses against LLM-based agents. To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a comprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the attacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios, over 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation metrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory poisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and 11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal critical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including system prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the highest average attack success rate of 84.30\%, but limited effectiveness shown in current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent security for the community. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate the agents' capability to balance utility and security.

| **[Enhancing Autonomous Driving Systems with On-Board Deployed Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11514v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Networks (NNs) trained through supervised learning struggle with managing edge-case scenarios common in real-world driving due to the intractability of exhaustive datasets covering all edge-cases, making knowledge-driven approaches, akin to how humans intuitively detect unexpected driving behavior, a suitable complement to data-driven methods. This work proposes a hybrid architecture combining low-level Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with locally deployed Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance decision-making and Human Machine Interaction (HMI). The DecisionxLLM module evaluates robotic state information against natural language instructions to ensure adherence to desired driving behavior. The MPCxLLM module then adjusts MPC parameters based on LLM-generated insights, achieving control adaptability while preserving the safety and constraint guarantees of traditional MPC systems. Further, to enable efficient on-board deployment and to eliminate dependency on cloud connectivity, we shift processing to the on-board computing platform: We propose an approach that exploits Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, and quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that these enhancements yield significant improvements in reasoning accuracy by up to 10.45%, control adaptability by as much as 52.2%, and up to 10.5x increase in computational efficiency (tokens/s), validating the proposed framework's practicality for real-time deployment even on down-scaled robotic platforms. This work bridges high-level decision-making with low-level control adaptability, offering a synergistic framework for knowledge-driven and adaptive Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS).</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Using Cooperative Co-evolutionary Search to Generate Metamorphic Test Cases for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03843v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) rely on Deep Neural Networks, allowing vehicles to navigate complex, open environments. However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 16 figures, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> | None |
| **[InstanceGaussian: Appearance-Semantic Joint Gaussian Representation for 3D Instance-Level Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19235v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding has become an essential area of research with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach, combining explicit modeling with neural adaptability to provide efficient and detailed scene representations. However, three major challenges remain in leveraging 3DGS for scene understanding: 1) an imbalance between appearance and semantics, where dense Gaussian usage for fine-grained texture modeling does not align with the minimal requirements for semantic attributes; 2) inconsistencies between appearance and semantics, as purely appearance-based Gaussians often misrepresent object boundaries; and 3) reliance on top-down instance segmentation methods, which struggle with uneven category distributions, leading to over- or under-segmentation. In this work, we propose InstanceGaussian, a method that jointly learns appearance and semantic features while adaptively aggregating instances. Our contributions include: i) a novel Semantic-Scaffold-GS representation balancing appearance and semantics to improve feature representations and boundary delineation; ii) a progressive appearance-semantic joint training strategy to enhance stability and segmentation accuracy; and iii) a bottom-up, category-agnostic instance aggregation approach that addresses segmentation challenges through farthest point sampling and connected component analysis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in category-agnostic, open-vocabulary 3D point-level segmentation, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed representation and training strategies.

| **[GATE3D: Generalized Attention-based Task-synergized Estimation in 3D*](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11014v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging trend in computer vision emphasizes developing universal models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple diverse tasks. Such universality typically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure effective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents unique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets annotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical road-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current pretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road environments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D object detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel framework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection via weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing consistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model achieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an indoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization capabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D significantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through effective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for broader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality applications.

| **[Text-Driven 3D Lidar Place Recognition for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18035v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environment description-based localization in large-scale point cloud maps constructed through remote sensing is critically significant for the advancement of large-scale autonomous systems, such as delivery robots operating in the last mile. However, current approaches encounter challenges due to the inability of point cloud encoders to effectively capture local details and long-range spatial relationships, as well as a significant modality gap between text and point cloud representations. To address these challenges, we present Des4Pos, a novel two-stage text-driven remote sensing localization framework. In the coarse stage, the point-cloud encoder utilizes the Multi-scale Fusion Attention Mechanism (MFAM) to enhance local geometric features, followed by a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to strengthen global spatial relationships. Concurrently, the Stepped Text Encoder (STE) integrates cross-modal prior knowledge from CLIP [1] and aligns text and point-cloud features using this prior knowledge, effectively bridging modality discrepancies. In the fine stage, we introduce a Cascaded Residual Attention (CRA) module to fuse cross-modal features and predict relative localization offsets, thereby achieving greater localization precision. Experiments on the KITTI360Pose test set demonstrate that Des4Pos achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-point-cloud place recognition. Specifically, it attains a top-1 accuracy of 40% and a top-10 accuracy of 77% under a 5-meter radius threshold, surpassing the best existing methods by 7% and 7%, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages | None |
| **[Can Vision-Language Models Understand and Interpret Dynamic Gestures from Pedestrians? Pilot Datasets and Exploration Towards Instructive Nonverbal Commands for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10873v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, it is crucial to correctly interpret traffic gestures (TGs), such as those of an authority figure providing orders or instructions, or a pedestrian signaling the driver, to ensure a safe and pleasant traffic environment for all road users. This study investigates the capabilities of state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) in zero-shot interpretation, focusing on their ability to caption and classify human gestures in traffic contexts. We create and publicly share two custom datasets with varying formal and informal TGs, such as 'Stop', 'Reverse', 'Hail', etc. The datasets are "Acted TG (ATG)" and "Instructive TG In-The-Wild (ITGI)". They are annotated with natural language, describing the pedestrian's body position and gesture. We evaluate models using three methods utilizing expert-generated captions as baseline and control: (1) caption similarity, (2) gesture classification, and (3) pose sequence reconstruction similarity. Results show that current VLMs struggle with gesture understanding: sentence similarity averages below 0.59, and classification F1 scores reach only 0.14-0.39, well below the expert baseline of 0.70. While pose reconstruction shows potential, it requires more data and refined metrics to be reliable. Our findings reveal that although some SOTA VLMs can interpret zero-shot human traffic gestures, none are accurate and robust enough to be trustworthy, emphasizing the need for further research in this domain.</p></details> |  | None |

However, current autonomous driving systems are mostly based on a single vehicle, which has significant limitations which still poses threats to driving safety. Collaborative perception with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows a promising solution to overcoming these limitations. In this article, we first identify the challenges of collaborative perception, such as data sharing asynchrony, data volume, and pose errors. Then, we discuss the possible solutions to address these challenges with various technologies, where the research opportunities are also elaborated. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to deal with communication efficiency and latency problems, which is a channel-aware collaborative perception framework to dynamically adjust the communication graph and minimize latency, thereby improving perception performance while increasing communication efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine (WCM)</p></details> | None |

To address these problems, this work employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as a decision-making component for complex AD scenarios that require human commonsense understanding. We devise cognitive pathways to enable comprehensive reasoning with LLMs, and develop algorithms for translating LLM decisions into actionable driving commands. Through this approach, LLM decisions are seamlessly integrated with low-level controllers by guided parameter matrix adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only consistently surpasses baseline approaches in single-vehicle tasks, but also helps handle complex driving behaviors even multi-vehicle coordination, thanks to the commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents an initial step toward leveraging LLMs as effective decision-makers for intricate AD scenarios in terms of safety, efficiency, generalizability, and interoperability. We aspire for it to serve as inspiration for future research in this field. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/llm-mpc</p></details> |  | None |

Computer vision techniques for traffic monitoring have not gained much popularity despite their relative strength in areas such as autonomous driving. Despite large number of academic methods for Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems, very few provide an end to end solution for patrolling in the city. This paper presents a novel prototype for a low power GPU based patrolling system to be deployed in an urban environment on surveillance vehicles for automated vehicle detection, recognition and tracking. In this work, we propose a complete ALPR system for Singapore license plates having both single and double line creating our own YOLO based network. We focus on unconstrained capture scenarios as would be the case in real world application, where the license plate (LP) might be considerably distorted due to oblique views. In this work, we first detect the license plate from the full image using RFB-Net and rectify multiple distorted license plates in a single image. After that, the detected license plate image is fed to our network for character recognition. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system on a newly built dataset covering more than 16,000 images. The system was able to correctly detect license plates with 86\% precision and recognize characters of a license plate in 67\% of the test set, and 89\% accuracy with one incorrect character (partial match). We also test latency of our system and achieve 64FPS on Tesla P4 GPU</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Southeast Con 2025.

| **[Adversarial Prompt Distillation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15244v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.</p></details> |  | None |

We investigate whether explicitly modeling reasoning during fine-tuning enhances VLM performance on driving decision tasks. Using GPT-4o, we generate structured reasoning chains for driving scenarios from the DriveLM benchmark with category-specific prompting strategies. We compare reasoning-based fine-tuning, answer-only fine-tuning, and baseline instruction-tuned models across multiple small VLM families (Llama 3.2, Llava 1.5, and Qwen 2.5VL). Our results demonstrate that reasoning-based fine-tuning consistently outperforms alternatives, with Llama3.2-11B-reason achieving the highest performance.

| **[FuzzSense: Towards A Modular Fuzzing Framework for Autonomous Driving Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10717v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzz testing to find semantic control vulnerabilities is an essential activity to evaluate the robustness of autonomous driving (AD) software. Whilst there is a preponderance of disparate fuzzing tools that target different parts of the test environment, such as the scenario, sensors, and vehicle dynamics, there is a lack of fuzzing strategies that ensemble these fuzzers to enable concurrent fuzzing, utilizing diverse techniques and targets. This research proposes FuzzSense, a modular, black-box, mutation-based fuzzing framework that is architected to ensemble diverse AD fuzzing tools. To validate the utility of FuzzSense, a LiDAR sensor fuzzer was developed as a plug-in, and the fuzzer was implemented in the new AD simulation platform AWSIM and Autoware.Universe AD software platform. The results demonstrated that FuzzSense was able to find vulnerabilities in the new Autoware.Universe software. We contribute to FuzzSense open-source with the aim of initiating a conversation in the community on the design of AD-specific fuzzers and the establishment of a community fuzzing framework to better target the diverse technology base of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Decoupled Diffusion Sparks Adaptive Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10485v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable scene generation could reduce the cost of diverse data collection substantially for autonomous driving. Prior works formulate the traffic layout generation as predictive progress, either by denoising entire sequences at once or by iteratively predicting the next frame. However, full sequence denoising hinders online reaction, while the latter's short-sighted next-frame prediction lacks precise goal-state guidance. Further, the learned model struggles to generate complex or challenging scenarios due to a large number of safe and ordinal driving behaviors from open datasets. To overcome these, we introduce Nexus, a decoupled scene generation framework that improves reactivity and goal conditioning by simulating both ordinal and challenging scenarios from fine-grained tokens with independent noise states. At the core of the decoupled pipeline is the integration of a partial noise-masking training strategy and a noise-aware schedule that ensures timely environmental updates throughout the denoising process. To complement challenging scenario generation, we collect a dataset consisting of complex corner cases. It covers 540 hours of simulated data, including high-risk interactions such as cut-in, sudden braking, and collision. Nexus achieves superior generation realism while preserving reactivity and goal orientation, with a 40% reduction in displacement error. We further demonstrate that Nexus improves closed-loop planning by 20% through data augmentation and showcase its capability in safety-critical data generation.</p></details> |  | None |

However, unlike human social learning, they lack a critical pathway for intrinsic cognitive development, namely, learning from human feedback during interaction. To understand human ubiquitous observation, supervision, and shared control in dynamic and uncertain environments, this study presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework that enables classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect cognitively demanding and safety-critical events. As a timely and motivating co-robotic engineering application, we simulate a human-in-the-loop scenario to flag risky events in semi-autonomous robotic driving-representative of long-tail cases that pose persistent bottlenecks to the safety performance of smart mobility systems and robotic vehicles. Drawing on recent advances in few-shot learning, we propose a dual-attention Siamese convolutional network paired with Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging approach to generate robust EEG-encoded signal representations. Inverse source localization reveals activation in Broadman areas 4 and 9, indicating perception-action coupling during task-relevant mental imagery. The model achieves 80% classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and exhibits a nearly 100% increase in the utility of salient features compared to state-of-the-art methods, as measured through integrated gradient attribution. Beyond performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the cognitive architecture required for BCI agents-particularly the role of attention and memory mechanisms-in categorizing diverse mental states and supporting both inter- and intra-subject adaptation. Overall, this research advances the development of cognitive robotics and socially guided learning for service robots in complex built environments.</p></details> | 50 pages, 18 figures | None |

This transformation allows vehicles to collect and share vast amounts of vehicle-specific and personal data. While these technological advancements offer enhanced user experiences, they also raise privacy concerns. To understand the ecosystem of data collection and sharing in modern vehicles, we adopted the ontology 101 methodology to incorporate information extracted from different sources, including analysis of privacy policies using GPT-4, a small-scale systematic literature review, and an existing ontology, to develop a high-level conceptual graph-based model, aiming to get insights into how modern vehicles handle data exchange among different parties. This serves as a foundational model with the flexibility and scalability to further expand for modelling and analysing data sharing practices across diverse contexts. Two realistic examples were developed to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of discovering insights into privacy regarding vehicle-related data sharing.

| **[Balancing Two Classifiers via A Simplex ETF Structure for Model Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10007v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various domains. However, despite their success, they often face calibration issues, particularly in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and healthcare, where unreliable predictions can have serious consequences. Recent research has started to improve model calibration from the view of the classifier. However, the exploration of designing the classifier to solve the model calibration problem is insufficient. Let alone most of the existing methods ignore the calibration errors arising from underconfidence. In this work, we propose a novel method by balancing learnable and ETF classifiers to solve the overconfidence or underconfidence problem for model Calibration named BalCAL. By introducing a confidence-tunable module and a dynamic adjustment method, we ensure better alignment between model confidence and its true accuracy. Extensive experimental validation shows that ours significantly improves model calibration performance while maintaining high predictive accuracy, outperforming existing techniques. This provides a novel solution to the calibration challenges commonly encountered in deep learning.</p></details> | CVPR2025 | None |

The proposed framework improves the input and state estimation (ISE) approach by integrating distributional robustness, enhancing the estimator's resilience and robustness to adversarial inputs and unmodeled dynamics. Moment-based ambiguity sets capture probabilistic uncertainties in both system dynamics and measurement noise, offering analytical tractability and efficiently handling uncertainties in mean and covariance. In particular, the proposed framework minimizes the worst-case estimation error, ensuring robustness against deviations from nominal distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations conducted in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, demonstrating improved performance in state estimation accuracy and robustness in dynamic and uncertain environments.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, RSR from the Bird's Eye View (BEV) has gained attention for its potential to enhance performance. However, existing methods for transforming perspective views to BEV face challenges such as information loss and representation sparsity. Moreover, stereo matching in BEV is limited by the need to balance accuracy with inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose two efficient and accurate BEV-based RSR models: FastRSR-mono and FastRSR-stereo. Specifically, we first introduce Depth-Aware Projection (DAP), an efficient view transformation strategy designed to mitigate information loss and sparsity by querying depth and image features to aggregate BEV data within specific road surface regions using a pre-computed look-up table. To optimize accuracy and speed in stereo matching, we design the Spatial Attention Enhancement (SAE) and Confidence Attention Generation (CAG) modules. SAE adaptively highlights important regions, while CAG focuses on high-confidence predictions and filters out irrelevant information. FastRSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exceeding monocular competitors by over 6.0% in elevation absolute error and providing at least a 3.0x speedup by stereo methods on the RSRD dataset.

We present the Autonomous Driving Digital Twin (ADDT) framework, a high-fidelity simulation platform designed to proactively identify hidden faults, evaluate real-time performance, and validate safety before deployment. ADDT combines realistic digital models of driving environments, vehicle dynamics, sensor behavior, and fault conditions to enable scalable, scenario-rich stress-testing under diverse and adverse conditions. It supports adaptive exploration of edge cases using reinforcement-driven techniques, uncovering failure modes that physical road testing often misses. By shifting from reactive debugging to proactive simulation-driven validation, ADDT enables a more rigorous and transparent approach to autonomous vehicle safety engineering.

Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, cross-modal alignment fine-tuning with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying pipeline based on KMeans clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and NuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures | None |

We explore the inherent tradeoff between annotation accuracy and cost by detecting and removing minority reports -- instances where annotators provide incorrect responses -- that indicate unnecessary redundancy in task assignments. We propose an approach to prune potentially redundant annotation task assignments before they are executed by estimating the likelihood of an annotator disagreeing with the majority vote for a given task. Our approach is informed by an empirical analysis over computer vision datasets annotated by a professional data annotation platform, which reveals that the likelihood of a minority report event is dependent primarily on image ambiguity, worker variability, and worker fatigue. Simulations over these datasets show that we can reduce the number of annotations required by over 60% with a small compromise in label quality, saving approximately 6.6 days-equivalent of labor. Our approach provides annotation service platforms with a method to balance cost and dataset quality. Machine learning practitioners can tailor annotation accuracy levels according to specific application needs, thereby optimizing budget allocation while maintaining the data quality necessary for critical settings like autonomous driving technology.</p></details> | 39 pages | None |

Previous works typically train the whole process end-to-end or integrate an additional referring text module into a multi-object tracker, but they both require supervised training and potentially struggle with generalization to open-set queries. In this work, we introduce ReferGPT, a novel zero-shot referring multi-object tracking framework.

Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.</p></details> |  | None |

The quality of acquired images directly influences the ability of autonomous driving systems to correctly recognize and respond to other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles in real-time. However, real environments present extreme variations in lighting, causing saturation problems and resulting in the loss of crucial details for detection. Traditionally, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images have been preferred for their ability to capture a broad spectrum of light intensities, but the need for multiple captures to construct HDR images is inefficient for real-time applications in autonomous vehicles. To address these issues, this work introduces the use of modulo sensors for robust object detection. The modulo sensor allows pixels to `reset/wrap' upon reaching saturation level by acquiring an irradiance encoding image which can then be recovered using unwrapping algorithms. The applied reconstruction techniques enable HDR recovery of color intensity and image details, ensuring better visual quality even under extreme lighting conditions at the cost of extra time. Experiments with the YOLOv10 model demonstrate that images processed using modulo images achieve performance comparable to HDR images and significantly surpass saturated images in terms of object detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed modulo imaging step combined with HDR image reconstruction is shorter than the time required for conventional HDR image acquisition.</p></details> |  | None |

While Offline Reinforcement Learning enables the training of autonomous vehicles using such data, most available datasets lack meaningful reward labels. Reward labeling is essential as it provides feedback for the learning algorithm to distinguish between desirable and undesirable behaviors, thereby improving policy performance. This paper presents a novel pipeline for generating human-aligned reward labels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of absent reward signals in real-world datasets by generating labels that reflect human judgment and safety considerations. The pipeline incorporates an adaptive safety component, activated by analyzing semantic segmentation maps, allowing the autonomous vehicle to prioritize safety over efficiency in potential collision scenarios. The proposed pipeline is applied to an occluded pedestrian crossing scenario with varying levels of pedestrian traffic, using synthetic and simulation data. The results indicate that the generated reward labels closely match the simulation reward labels. When used to train the driving policy using Behavior Proximal Policy Optimisation, the results are competitive with other baselines. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in producing reliable and human-aligned reward signals, facilitating the training of autonomous driving systems through Reinforcement Learning outside of simulation environments and in alignment with human values.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> | None |

Specifically, our approach, namely NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid pose aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid pose. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding their relative pose. We demonstrate the efficacy of NCLR by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation.

However, most existing approaches do not reconstruct semantic labels, which are crucial for many downstream applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception. Unlike images, which benefit from powerful segmentation models, LiDAR point clouds lack such large-scale pre-trained models, making semantic annotation time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose SN-LiDAR, a method that jointly performs accurate semantic segmentation, high-quality geometric reconstruction, and realistic LiDAR synthesis. Specifically, we employ a coarse-to-fine planar-grid feature representation to extract global features from multi-frame point clouds and leverage a CNN-based encoder to extract local semantic features from the current frame point cloud. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and KITTI-360 demonstrate the superiority of SN-LiDAR in both semantic and geometric reconstruction, effectively handling dynamic objects and large-scale scenes.

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process.

While vehicle sensing has been extensively studied, infrastructure sensing has received little attention, especially given the unique challenges of diverse intersection geometries, complex occlusions, varying traffic conditions, and ambient environments like lighting and weather. To address these issues and ensure cost-effective sensor placement, we propose Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Infrastructure Sensor Placement Evaluation (InSPE), a perception surrogate metric set that rapidly assesses perception effectiveness across diverse infrastructure and environmental scenarios with combinations of multi-modal sensors. InSPE systematically evaluates perception capabilities by integrating three carefully designed metrics, i.e., sensor coverage, perception occlusion, and information gain. To support large-scale evaluation, we develop a data generation tool within the CARLA simulator and also introduce Infra-Set, a dataset covering diverse intersection types and environmental conditions. Benchmarking experiments with state-of-the-art perception algorithms demonstrate that InSPE enables efficient and scalable sensor placement analysis, providing a robust solution for optimizing intelligent intersection infrastructure.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing methods are often tailored to specific degradation scenarios, limiting their adaptability to the diverse and complex challenges in real-world environments. Moreover, real-world degradations are typically non-uniform, highlighting the need for adaptive and intelligent solutions. To address these issues, we propose a novel vision-language-guided universal restoration (VL-UR) framework. VL-UR leverages a zero-shot contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model to enhance image restoration by integrating visual and semantic information. A scene classifier is introduced to adapt CLIP, generating high-quality language embeddings aligned with degraded images while predicting degraded types for complex scenarios. Extensive experiments across eleven diverse degradation settings demonstrate VL-UR's state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and adaptability. This positions VL-UR as a transformative solution for modern image restoration challenges in dynamic, real-world environments.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce a novel energy-overloading attack that leverages vision language model (VLM) prompts to generate adversarial images targeting vision models. These images, though imperceptible to the human eye, significantly increase GPU energy consumption across various vision models, threatening the availability of these systems. Our framework, EO-VLM (Energy Overload via VLM), is model-agnostic, meaning it is not limited by the architecture or type of the target vision model. By exploiting the lack of safety filters in VLMs like DALL-E 3, we create adversarial noise images without requiring prior knowledge or internal structure of the target vision models. Our experiments demonstrate up to a 50% increase in energy consumption, revealing a critical vulnerability in current vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented as a poster at ACSAC 2024</p></details> | None |

A deeper understanding of truck characteristics is essential for enhancing the safety perspective of cooperative autonomous driving. Traditional LiDAR-based truck classification methods rely on extensive manual annotations, which makes them labor-intensive and costly. The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) trained on massive datasets presents an opportunity to leverage their few-shot learning capabilities for truck classification. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) are primarily trained on image datasets, which makes it challenging to directly process point cloud data. This study introduces a novel framework that integrates roadside LiDAR point cloud data with VLMs to facilitate efficient and accurate truck classification, which supports cooperative and safe driving environments. This study introduces three key innovations: (1) leveraging real-world LiDAR datasets for model development, (2) designing a preprocessing pipeline to adapt point cloud data for VLM input, including point cloud registration for dense 3D rendering and mathematical morphological techniques to enhance feature representation, and (3) utilizing in-context learning with few-shot prompting to enable vehicle classification with minimally labeled training data. Experimental results demonstrate encouraging performance of this method and present its potential to reduce annotation efforts while improving classification accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,3 figures, 1 table, CVPR DriveX workshop</p></details> | None |

This paper introduces a novel training strategy based on curriculum learning to improve the robustness of deep learning models for extreme image deblurring. Unlike conventional approaches that train on only low to moderate blur levels, our method progressively increases the difficulty by introducing images with higher blur severity over time, allowing the model to adapt incrementally. Additionally, we integrate perceptual and hinge loss during training to enhance fine detail restoration and improve training stability. We experimented with various curriculum learning strategies and explored the impact of the train-test domain gap on the deblurring performance. Experimental results on the Extreme-GoPro dataset showed that our method outperforms the next best method by 14% in SSIM, whereas experiments on the Extreme-KITTI dataset showed that our method outperforms the next best by 18% in SSIM. Ablation studies showed that a linear curriculum progression outperforms step-wise, sigmoid, and exponential progressions, while hyperparameter settings such as the training blur percentage and loss function formulation all play important roles in addressing extreme blur artifacts.

We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data.DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings.

Existing solutions often suffer from high computational overhead or fail to adequately address the uncertainty of evolving traffic scenarios. This paper introduces LATTE, a Lightweight Attention-based Traffic Accident Anticipation Engine, which integrates computational efficiency with state-of-the-art performance. LATTE employs Efficient Multiscale Spatial Aggregation (EMSA) to capture spatial features across scales, Memory Attention Aggregation (MAA) to enhance temporal modeling, and Auxiliary Self-Attention Aggregation (AAA) to extract latent dependencies over extended sequences. Additionally, LATTE incorporates the Flamingo Alert-Assisted System (FAA), leveraging a vision-language model to provide real-time, cognitively accessible verbal hazard alerts, improving passenger situational awareness. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate LATTE's superior predictive capabilities and computational efficiency. LATTE achieves state-of-the-art 89.74% Average Precision (AP) on DAD benchmark, with 5.4% higher mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA) than the second-best model, and maintains competitive mTTA at a Recall of 80% (TTA@R80) (4.04s) while demonstrating robust accident anticipation across diverse driving conditions. Its lightweight design delivers a 93.14% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and a 31.58% decrease in parameter count (Params), enabling real-time operation on resource-limited hardware without compromising performance.

Although other spectral bands like near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception in such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over NIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently incorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce the RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000 synchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a subset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset of challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging through experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation. Our experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework significantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches, particularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We anticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral imaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.</p></details> |  | None |

Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10$\times$ reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090.

In recent years, the end-to-end driving has shown great promise in advancing vehicle autonomy in a scalable manner. However, existing approaches often face safety risks due to the lack of explicit behavior constraints. To address this issue, we uncover a new paradigm by introducing the corridor as the intermediate representation. Widely adopted in robotics planning, the corridors represents spatio-temporal obstacle-free zones for the vehicle to traverse. To ensure accurate corridor prediction in diverse traffic scenarios, we develop a comprehensive learning pipeline including data annotation, architecture refinement and loss formulation. The predicted corridor is further integrated as the constraint in a trajectory optimization process. By extending the differentiability of the optimization, we enable the optimized trajectory to be seamlessly trained within the end-to-end learning framework, improving both safety and interpretability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our approach, showing a 66.7% reduction in collisions with agents and a 46.5% reduction with curbs, significantly enhancing the safety of end-to-end driving. Additionally, incorporating the corridor contributes to higher success rates in closed-loop evaluations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures | None |

While existing methods rely on multi-frame image sequences to identify moving objects, single-image MOS is critical for applications like motion intention prediction and handling camera frame drops. However, segmenting moving objects from a single image remains challenging for existing methods due to the absence of temporal cues. To address this gap, we propose MovSAM, the first framework for single-image moving object segmentation. MovSAM leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to search the moving object and generate text prompts based on deep thinking for segmentation. These prompts are cross-fused with visual features from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and a Vision-Language Model (VLM), enabling logic-driven moving object segmentation. The segmentation results then undergo a deep thinking refinement loop, allowing MovSAM to iteratively improve its understanding of the scene context and inter-object relationships with logical reasoning. This innovative approach enables MovSAM to segment moving objects in single images by considering scene understanding. We implement MovSAM in the real world to validate its practical application and effectiveness for autonomous driving scenarios where the multi-frame methods fail. Furthermore, despite the inherent advantage of multi-frame methods in utilizing temporal information, MovSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across public MOS benchmarks, reaching 92.5\% on J\&F.

Despite extensive researches in transportation and communication to support V2X-AD, the actual utilization of these infrastructures and communication resources in enhancing driving performances remains largely unexplored. This highlights the necessity of collaborative autonomous driving: a machine learning approach that optimizes the information sharing strategy to improve the driving performance of each vehicle. This effort necessitates two key foundations: a platform capable of generating data to facilitate the training and testing of V2X-AD, and a comprehensive system that integrates full driving-related functionalities with mechanisms for information sharing.

These frameworks struggle to quantify dynamic interaction risks in real-time and depend heavily on manual rules, resulting in low computational efficiency and conservative strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a Dynamic Residual Safe Reinforcement Learning (DRS-RL) framework grounded in a safety-enhanced networked Markov decision process. It's the first time that the weak-to-strong theory is introduced into multi-agent decision-making, enabling lightweight dynamic calibration of safety boundaries via a weak-to-strong safety correction paradigm. Based on the multi-agent dynamic conflict zone model, our framework accurately captures spatiotemporal coupling risks among heterogeneous traffic participants and surpasses the static constraints of conventional geometric rules. Moreover, a risk-aware prioritized experience replay mechanism mitigates data distribution bias by mapping risk to sampling probability. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in safety, efficiency, and comfort. Specifically, it reduces the collision rate by up to 92.17%, while the safety model accounts for merely 27% of the main model's parameters.</p></details> |  | None |

The number of measurable states and their precision offered by the onboard vehicle sensor system are often constrained by cost. For instance, measuring critical quantities such as the Vehicle Sideslip Angle (VSA) poses significant commercial challenges using current optical sensors. This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on the development of high-performance virtual sensors to enhance vehicle state estimation for active safety. The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Learning (UAHL) architecture integrates a machine learning model with vehicle motion models to estimate VSA directly from onboard sensor data. A key aspect of the UAHL architecture is its focus on uncertainty quantification for individual model estimates and hybrid fusion.

Despite advancements in autonomous driving, traditional pipelines rely on deterministic models that fail to capture the probabilistic nature and inherent uncertainty of real-world driving. To address this, we propose PRIMEDrive-CoT, a novel uncertainty-aware model for object interaction and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in driving scenarios. In particular, our approach combines LiDAR-based 3D object detection with multi-view RGB references to ensure interpretable and reliable scene understanding. Uncertainty and risk assessment, along with object interactions, are modelled using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs) for probabilistic reasoning under ambiguous conditions. Interpretable decisions are facilitated through CoT reasoning, leveraging object dynamics and contextual cues, while Grad-CAM visualizations highlight attention regions. Extensive evaluations on the DriveCoT dataset demonstrate that PRIMEDrive-CoT outperforms state-of-the-art CoT and risk-aware models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 - CVPRW</p></details> | None |

However, this is not the case with most real-world applications like autonomous driving or in nature where animals roam. Some experiences are encountered frequently, and most of the remaining experiences occur rarely; the resulting distribution is called Zipfian. Taking inspiration from the theory of complementary learning systems, an architecture for learning from Zipfian distributions is proposed where important long tail trajectories are discovered in an unsupervised manner. The proposal comprises an episodic memory buffer containing a prioritised memory module to ensure important rare trajectories are kept longer to address the Zipfian problem, which needs credit assignment to happen in a sample efficient manner. The experiences are then reinstated from episodic memory and given weighted importance forming the trajectory to be executed. Notably, the proposed architecture is modular, can be incorporated in any RL architecture and yields improved performance in multiple Zipfian tasks over traditional architectures. Our method outperforms IMPALA by a significant margin on all three tasks and all three evaluation metrics (Zipfian, Uniform, and Rare Accuracy) and also gives improvements on most Atari environments that are considered challenging</p></details> |  | None |

These factors generate difficulties in the accurate recognition of human intentions and the generation of comfortable, socially aware trajectories. To address these issues, we propose SAP-CoPE, a social-aware planning framework that integrates cooperative infrastructure with a novel 3D human pose estimation method and a model predictive control-based controller. This real-time framework formulates an optimization problem that accounts for uncertainty propagation in the camera projection matrix while ensuring human joint coherence. The proposed method is adaptable to single- or multi-camera configurations and can incorporate sparse LiDAR point-cloud data. To enhance safety and comfort in human environments, we integrate a human personal space field based on human pose into a model predictive controller, enabling the system to navigate while avoiding discomfort zones. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating socially aware trajectories for autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics</p></details> | None |

This paper explores the unique advantage of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR in autonomous perception. Given a single frame FMCW point cloud with radial velocity measurements, we expect that our object detector can detect the short-term future locations of objects using only the current frame sensor data and demonstrate a fast ability to respond to intermediate danger. To achieve this, we extend the standard object detection task to a novel task named predictive object detection (POD), which aims to predict the short-term future location and dimensions of objects based solely on current observations. Typically, a motion prediction task requires historical sensor information to process the temporal contexts of each object, while our detector's avoidance of multi-frame historical information enables a much faster response time to potential dangers. The core advantage of FMCW LiDAR lies in the radial velocity associated with every reflected point. We propose a novel POD framework, the core idea of which is to generate a virtual future point using a ray casting mechanism, create virtual two-frame point clouds with the current and virtual future frames, and encode these two-frame voxel features with a sparse 4D encoder. Subsequently, the 4D voxel features are separated by temporal indices and remapped into two Bird's Eye View (BEV) features: one decoded for standard current frame object detection and the other for future predictive object detection. Extensive experiments on our in-house dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art standard and predictive detection performance of the proposed POD framework.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing 3D occupancy networks (OccNets) are both computationally heavy and label-hungry. In terms of model complexity, OccNets are commonly composed of heavy Conv3D modules or transformers at the voxel level. Moreover, OccNets are supervised with expensive large-scale dense voxel labels. Model and data inefficiencies, caused by excessive network parameters and label annotation requirements, severely hinder the onboard deployment of OccNets. This paper proposes an EFFicient Occupancy learning framework, EFFOcc, that targets minimal network complexity and label requirements while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We first propose an efficient fusion-based OccNet that only uses simple 2D operators and improves accuracy to the state-of-the-art on three large-scale benchmarks: Occ3D-nuScenes, Occ3D-Waymo, and OpenOccupancy-nuScenes. On the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, the fusion-based model with ResNet-18 as the image backbone has 21.35M parameters and achieves 51.49 in terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage occupancy-oriented distillation to efficiently transfer knowledge to vision-only OccNet. Extensive experiments on occupancy benchmarks show state-of-the-art precision for both fusion-based and vision-based OccNets. For the demonstration of learning with limited labels, we achieve 94.38\% of the performance (mIoU = 28.38) of a 100\% labeled vision OccNet (mIoU = 30.07) using the same OccNet trained with only 40\% labeled sequences and distillation from the fusion-based OccNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/synsin0/EFFOcc</p></details> | [Code Link](https://github.com/synsin0/EFFOcc) |

The main issue pertains to the object-oriented modelling paradigm, which requires georeferencing, watertight geometry, facade semantics, and low-poly representation -- Contrasting unstructured mesh-oriented models. In Texture2LoD3, we introduce a novel method leveraging the ubiquity of 3D building model priors and panoramic street-level images, enabling the reconstruction of LoD3 building models. We observe that prior low-detail building models can serve as valid planar targets for ortho-rectifying street-level panoramic images. Moreover, deploying segmentation on accurately textured low-level building surfaces supports maintaining essential georeferencing, watertight geometry, and low-poly representation for LoD3 reconstruction. In the absence of LoD3 validation data, we additionally introduce the ReLoD3 dataset, on which we experimentally demonstrate that our method leads to improved facade segmentation accuracy by 11% and can replace costly manual projections. We believe that Texture2LoD3 can scale the adoption of LoD3 models, opening applications in estimating building solar potential or enhancing autonomous driving simulations.

However, conventional channel estimation methods, such as pilot signals or beam sweeping, often fail to adapt to rapidly changing communication environments. To address this limitation, multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction has gained significant attention, using various sensing data from devices such as LiDAR, radar, GPS, and RGB images to predict user locations or network conditions. Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications on Apr. 07, 2025</p></details> | None |

As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems. Experiments are conducted on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.</p></details> |  | None |

However, uncertainties introduced by inherent driving behaviors -- such as acceleration, deceleration, and left and right maneuvers -- pose significant challenges for reliable trajectory prediction. We introduce a Maneuver-Intention-Aware Transformer (MIAT) architecture, which integrates a maneuver intention awareness mechanism with spatiotemporal interaction modeling to enhance long-horizon trajectory predictions. We systematically investigate the impact of varying awareness of maneuver intention on both short- and long-horizon trajectory predictions. Evaluated on the real-world NGSIM dataset and benchmarked against various transformer- and LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an improvement of up to 4.7% in short-horizon predictions and a 1.6% in long-horizon predictions compared to other intention-aware benchmark methods. Moreover, by leveraging an intention awareness control mechanism, MIAT realizes an 11.1% performance boost in long-horizon predictions, with a modest drop in short-horizon performance.</p></details> |  | None |

Moreover, AI is widely employed in different critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. In such applications, using AI as black-box models is risky and challenging. Hence, it is crucial to understand and trust the decisions taken by these models. Tackling this issue can be achieved by developing explainable AI (XAI) schemes that aim to explain the logic behind the black-box model behavior, and thus, ensure its efficient and safe deployment. Recently, we proposed a novel perturbation-based XAI-CHEST framework that is oriented toward channel estimation in wireless communications. The core idea of the XAI-CHEST framework is to identify the relevant model inputs by inducing high noise on the irrelevant ones. This manuscript provides the detailed theoretical foundations of the XAI-CHEST framework. In particular, we derive the analytical expressions of the XAI-CHEST loss functions and the noise threshold fine-tuning optimization problem. Hence the designed XAI-CHEST delivers a smart input feature selection methodology that can further improve the overall performance while optimizing the architecture of the employed model. Simulation results show that the XAI-CHEST framework provides valid interpretations, where it offers an improved bit error rate performance while reducing the required computational complexity in comparison to the classical DL-based channel estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking on 19 March 2025</p></details> | None |

Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 WDFM-AD | None |
| **[AgentSpec: Customizable Runtime Enforcement for Safe and Reliable LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18666v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents built on LLMs are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, automating complex decision-making and task execution. However, their autonomy introduces safety risks, including security vulnerabilities, legal violations, and unintended harmful actions. Existing mitigation methods, such as model-based safeguards and early enforcement strategies, fall short in robustness, interpretability, and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose AgentSpec, a lightweight domain-specific language for specifying and enforcing runtime constraints on LLM agents. With AgentSpec, users define structured rules that incorporate triggers, predicates, and enforcement mechanisms, ensuring agents operate within predefined safety boundaries. We implement AgentSpec across multiple domains, including code execution, embodied agents, and autonomous driving, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that AgentSpec successfully prevents unsafe executions in over 90% of code agent cases, eliminates all hazardous actions in embodied agent tasks, and enforces 100% compliance by autonomous vehicles (AVs). Despite its strong safety guarantees, AgentSpec remains computationally lightweight, with overheads in milliseconds. By combining interpretability, modularity, and efficiency, AgentSpec provides a practical and scalable solution for enforcing LLM agent safety across diverse applications. We also automate the generation of rules using LLMs and assess their effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that the rules generated by OpenAI o1 achieve a precision of 95.56% and recall of 70.96% for embodied agents, successfully identifying 87.26% of the risky code, and prevent AVs from breaking laws in 5 out of 8 scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  | None |

In this paper, we introduce GAMDTP, a novel graph attention-based network tailored for dynamic trajectory prediction. Specifically, we fuse the result of self attention and mamba-ssm through a gate mechanism, leveraging the strengths of both to extract features more efficiently and accurately, in each graph convolution layer. GAMDTP encodes the high-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory coordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically fusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including proposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage frameworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction quality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  | None |

As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of P2F. It achieves the highest ranking in the OoDIS anomaly instance benchmark among methods not using OOD data in any way.</p></details> |  | None |

Training models for this task -- predicting lane markers, road edges, and pedestrian crossings -- traditionally require extensive labelled data, which is expensive and labour-intensive to obtain. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in other domains, its potential for online mapping remains largely underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by demonstrating the effectiveness of SSL methods for online mapping. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective method leveraging the inherent properties of online mapping by fusing the teacher's pseudo-labels from multiple samples, enhancing the reliability of self-supervised training. If 10% of the data has labels, our method to leverage unlabelled data achieves a 3.5x performance boost compared to only using the labelled data. This narrows the gap to a fully supervised model, using all labels, to just 3.5 mIoU. We also show strong generalization to unseen cities. Specifically, in Argoverse 2, when adapting to Pittsburgh, incorporating purely unlabelled target-domain data reduces the performance gap from 5 to 0.5 mIoU. These results highlight the potential of SSL as a powerful tool for solving the online mapping problem, significantly reducing reliance on labelled data.</p></details> |  | None |

However, the safety and robustness assessment of autonomous driving has not received sufficient attention. Current evaluations of autonomous driving are typically conducted in natural driving scenarios. However, many accidents often occur in edge cases, also known as safety-critical scenarios. These safety-critical scenarios are difficult to collect, and there is currently no clear definition of what constitutes a safety-critical scenario. In this work, we explore the safety and robustness of autonomous driving in safety-critical scenarios. First, we provide a definition of safety-critical scenarios, including static traffic scenarios such as adversarial attack scenarios and natural distribution shifts, as well as dynamic traffic scenarios such as accident scenarios. Then, we develop an autonomous driving safety testing platform to comprehensively evaluate autonomous driving systems, encompassing not only the assessment of perception modules but also system-level evaluations.

Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA.

Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17 s to 5.09 s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies.</p></details> |  | None |

However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate reward functions that reflect human implicit knowledge. We study this in three challenging settings -- autonomous driving, humanoid locomotion, and dexterous manipulation -- wherein notions of ``good" behavior are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, a truly evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in RL. REvolve generates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. Experimentally, we demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2025.

However, their generalization often suffers due to domain-specific data distributions, making an effective scene-based categorization of samples necessary to improve their reliability across diverse domains. Manual captioning, though valuable, is both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck in the data annotation process. Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) present a compelling solution by automating image analysis and categorization through contextual queries, often without requiring retraining for new categories. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaVA, to understand and classify urban traffic scenes on both an in-house dataset and the BDD100K. We propose a scalable captioning pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art models, enabling a flexible deployment on new datasets. Our analysis, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights, demonstrates the effectiveness of LVLMs to understand urban traffic scenarios and highlights their potential as an efficient tool for data-driven advancements in autonomous driving.</p></details> | Accepted at WACV2025 | None |

Standard commercial imaging systems face limitations in capacity for well depth, and quantization precision, hindering their HDR capabilities. Modulo imaging, based on unlimited sampling (US) theory, addresses these limitations by using a modulo analog-to-digital approach that resets signals upon saturation, enabling estimation of pixel resets through neighboring pixel intensities. Despite the effectiveness of (US) algorithms in one-dimensional signals, their optimization problem for two-dimensional signals remains unclear. This work formulates the US framework as an autoregressive $\ell_2$ phase unwrapping problem, providing computationally efficient solutions in the discrete cosine domain jointly with a stride removal algorithm also based on spatial differences. By leveraging higher-order finite differences for two-dimensional images, our approach enhances HDR image reconstruction from modulo images, demonstrating its efficacy in improving object detection in autonomous driving scenes without retraining.</p></details> |  | None |

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.

Current solutions are often limited, as they either depend on specific degradation priors or suffer from significant domain gaps. To enable robust and autonomous operation in real-world conditions, we propose JarvisIR, a VLM-powered agent that leverages the VLM as a controller to manage multiple expert restoration models. To further enhance system robustness, reduce hallucinations, and improve generalizability in real-world adverse weather, JarvisIR employs a novel two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning and human feedback alignment. Specifically, to address the lack of paired data in real-world scenarios, the human feedback alignment enables the VLM to be fine-tuned effectively on large-scale real-world data in an unsupervised manner. To support the training and evaluation of JarvisIR, we introduce CleanBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of high-quality and large-scale instruction-responses pairs, including 150K synthetic entries and 80K real entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JarvisIR exhibits superior decision-making and restoration capabilities.

However, due to relatively lagging performance of event-based approaches, event cameras have not yet replace traditional cameras in performance-critical applications like autonomous driving. Recent approaches in event-based object detection try to bridge this gap by employing computationally expensive transformer-based solutions. However, due to their resource-intensive components, these solutions fail to exploit the sparsity and higher temporal resolution of event cameras efficiently. Moreover, these solutions are adopted from the vision domain, lacking specificity to the event cameras. In this work, we explore efficient and performant alternatives to recurrent vision transformer models and propose a novel event-based object detection backbone. The proposed backbone employs a novel Event Progression Extractor module, tailored specifically for event data, and uses Metaformer concept with convolution-based efficient components. We evaluate the resultant model on well-established traffic object detection benchmarks and conduct cross-dataset evaluation to test its ability to generalize. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on Prophesee Gen1 dataset by 1.6 mAP while reducing inference time by 14%. Our proposed EMF becomes the fastest DNN-based architecture in the domain by outperforming most efficient event-based object detectors.

While single-vehicle perception systems encounter limitations, stemming from incomplete perception due to object occlusion and inherent blind spots, cooperative perception systems present their own challenges in terms of sensor calibration precision and positioning accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). First, we employ Temporal Self-Attention and VIC Cross-Attention modules to effectively integrate temporal and spatial information from both vehicle and infrastructure perspectives. Then, we develop a novel Calibration Error Compensation (CEC) module to mitigate sensor misalignment issues and facilitate accurate feature alignment. Experiments on the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that LET-VIC significantly outperforms baseline models. Compared to LET-V, LET-VIC achieves +15.0% improvement in mAP and a +17.3% improvement in AMOTA.

However, effectively integrating these methods into the automotive development lifecycle remains challenging. Since the performance of machine learning algorithms relies heavily on the training data provided, the data and model development lifecycle play a key role in successfully integrating these components into the product development lifecycle. Existing models frequently encounter difficulties recognizing or adapting to novel instances not present in the original training dataset. This poses a significant risk for reliable deployment in dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive neural network architecture and an iterative development framework that enables users to efficiently incorporate previously unknown objects into the current perception system. Our approach builds on continuous learning, emphasizing the necessity of dynamic updates to reflect real-world deployment conditions. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline with three key components: (1) a scalable network extension strategy to integrate new classes while preserving existing performance, (2) a dynamic OoD detection component that requires no additional retraining for newly added classes, and (3) a retrieval-based data augmentation process tailored for safety-critical deployments. The integration of these components establishes a pragmatic and adaptive pipeline for the continuous evolution of perception systems in the context of autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> | None |

However, pre-build HD map requires a large cost. Visual-based Online Map Generation (OMG) has become an alternative low-cost solution to build a local HD map. Query-based BEV Transformer has been a base model for this task. This model learns HD map predictions from an initial map queries distribution which is obtained by offline optimization on training set. Besides the quality of BEV feature, the performance of this model also highly relies on the capacity of initial map query distribution. However, this distribution is limited because the limited query number. To make map predictions optimal on each test sample, it is essential to generate a suitable initial distribution for each specific scenario. This paper proposes to decompose the whole HD map distribution into a set of point representations, namely map query bank (MQBank). To build specific map query initial distributions of different scenarios, low-cost standard definition map (SD map) data is introduced as a kind of prior knowledge. Moreover, each layer of map decoder network learns instance-level map query features, which will lose detailed information of each point. However, BEV feature map is a point-level dense feature. It is important to keep point-level information in map queries when interacting with BEV feature map. This can also be solved with map query bank method. Final experiments show a new insight on SD map prior and a new record on OpenLaneV2 benchmark with 40.5%, 45.7% mAP on vehicle lane and pedestrian area.</p></details> |  | None |

Hence, reliable operation-time monitors for identification of out-of-training-data-distribution (OOD) scenarios are imperative. Current approaches for OOD classification are untested for complex domains like AD, are limited in the kinds of shifts they detect, or even require supervision with OOD samples. To prepare for unanticipated shifts, we instead establish a framework around a principled, unsupervised and model-agnostic method that unifies detection of semantic and covariate shifts: Find a full model of the training data's feature distribution, to then use its density at new points as in-distribution (ID) score. To implement this, we propose to combine Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as feature extractors with density modeling techniques. Through a comprehensive benchmark of 4 VFMs with different backbone architectures and 5 density-modeling techniques against established baselines, we provide the first systematic evaluation of OOD classification capabilities of VFMs across diverse conditions. A comparison with state-of-the-art binary OOD classification methods reveals that VFM embeddings with density estimation outperform existing approaches in identifying OOD inputs. Additionally, we show that our method detects high-risk inputs likely to cause errors in downstream tasks, thereby improving overall performance. Overall, VFMs, when coupled with robust density modeling techniques, are promising to realize model-agnostic, unsupervised, reliable safety monitors in complex vision tasks</p></details> |  | None |

Many applications in AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing datasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene joint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the balanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled data. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme based on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object classes, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a similarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation and a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an uncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select instances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner. Finally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy yields an optimal and valuable subdataset. Experiments on the KITTI, Lyft, nuScenes and SUScape datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 3D object detection tasks with up to 12% improvements.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation. While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm, and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to unprojection-based methods.

To address this, we introduce MinkOcc, a multi-modal 3D semantic occupancy prediction framework for cameras and LiDARs that proposes a two-step semi-supervised training procedure. Here, a small dataset of explicitly 3D annotations warm-starts the training process; then, the supervision is continued by simpler-to-annotate accumulated LiDAR sweeps and images -- semantically labelled through vision foundational models. MinkOcc effectively utilizes these sensor-rich supervisory cues and reduces reliance on manual labeling by 90\% while maintaining competitive accuracy. In addition, the proposed model incorporates information from LiDAR and camera data through early fusion and leverages sparse convolution networks for real-time prediction. With its efficiency in both supervision and computation, we aim to extend MinkOcc beyond curated datasets, enabling broader real-world deployment of 3D semantic occupancy prediction in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 8 pages | None |

The unbounded complexity of the driving context, including unforeseeable events, necessitate continuous improvement, often achieved through iterative DevOps processes. However, DevOps processes are themselves complex, making these improvements both time- and resource-intensive. Automation in code generation for ADS using Large Language Models (LLM) is one potential approach to address this challenge. Nevertheless, the development of ADS requires rigorous processes to verify, validate, assess, and qualify the code before it can be deployed in the vehicle and used. In this study, we developed and evaluated a prototype for automatic code generation and assessment using a designed pipeline of a LLM-based agent, simulation model, and rule-based feedback generator in an industrial setup. The LLM-generated code is evaluated automatically in a simulation model against multiple critical traffic scenarios, and an assessment report is provided as feedback to the LLM for modification or bug fixing. We report about the experimental results of the prototype employing Codellama:34b, DeepSeek (r1:32b and Coder:33b), CodeGemma:7b, Mistral:7b, and GPT4 for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Unsupervised Collision Avoidance by Evasive Manoeuvre (CAEM).

In this paper, we raise an intriguing question: can the combination of image restoration and object detection enhance detection performance in adverse weather conditions? To answer it, we propose an effective architecture that bridges image dehazing and object detection together via guidance information and task-driven learning to achieve detection-friendly dehazing, termed FriendNet. FriendNet aims to deliver both high-quality perception and high detection capacity. Different from existing efforts that intuitively treat image dehazing as pre-processing, FriendNet establishes a positive correlation between these two tasks. Clean features generated by the dehazing network potentially contribute to improvements in object detection performance. Conversely, object detection crucially guides the learning process of the image dehazing network under the task-driven learning scheme. We shed light on how downstream tasks can guide upstream dehazing processes, considering both network architecture and learning objectives. We design Guidance Fusion Block (GFB) and Guidance Attention Block (GAB) to facilitate the integration of detection information into the network. Furthermore, the incorporation of the detection task loss aids in refining the optimization process. Additionally, we introduce a new Physics-aware Feature Enhancement Block (PFEB), which integrates physics-based priors to enhance the feature extraction and representation capabilities. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods on both image quality and detection precision.

While unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing methods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world perturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work first identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA robustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in shared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by domain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address the proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a robustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial attack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention alignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving discriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a contrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that progressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on SynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of 14.3\% under adversarial attack.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures | None |

Since even minor environmental changes can significantly degrade system performance, and conducting long-term posterior experimental evaluations in all scenarios is often infeasible, it is crucial to perform a priori performance assessments to design robust and reliable systems. In this paper, we consider a discrete ubiquitous sensing system where the sensing target has \(m\) different states \(W\), which can be characterized by \(n\)-dimensional independent features \(X^n\). This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the sensing systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities and more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).

Previous end-to-end autonomous driving works represent both types of information in a single feature vector. However, including motion related tasks, such as prediction and planning, impairs detection and tracking performance, a phenomenon known as negative transfer in multi-task learning. To address this issue, we propose Neural-Bayes motion decoding, a novel parallel detection, tracking, and prediction method that separates semantic and motion learning. Specifically, we employ a set of learned motion queries that operate in parallel with detection and tracking queries, sharing a unified set of recursively updated reference points. Moreover, we employ interactive semantic decoding to enhance information exchange in semantic tasks, promoting positive transfer. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset with UniAD and SparseDrive confirm the effectiveness of our divide and merge approach, resulting in performance improvements across perception, prediction, and planning.

Most existing closed-loop simulators rely on rule-based controls for other vehicles, which results in a lack of diversity and randomness, thus failing to accurately assess the motion planning capabilities in highly interactive scenarios. Moreover, traditional evaluation metrics are insufficient for comprehensively evaluating the performance of merging in dense traffic. In response, we proposed a closed-loop evaluation benchmark for assessing motion planning capabilities in merging scenarios. Our approach involves other vehicles trained in large scale datasets with micro-behavioral characteristics that significantly enhance the complexity and diversity. Additionally, we have restructured the evaluation mechanism by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess each autonomous vehicle merging onto the main lane. Extensive experiments and test-vehicle deployment have demonstrated the progressiveness of this benchmark.

Traditional local differential privacy methods, designed for scalars and matrices, are insufficient for tensors, as they fail to preserve essential relationships among tensor elements. We introduce TLDP, a novel LDP algorithm for Tensors, which employs a randomized response mechanism to perturb tensor components while maintaining structural integrity. To strike a better balance between utility and privacy, we incorporate a weight matrix that selectively protects sensitive regions. Both theoretical analysis and empirical findings from real-world datasets show that TLDP achieves superior utility while preserving privacy, making it a robust solution for high-dimensional tensor data.</p></details> |  | None |

In applications like autonomous driving, online targetless calibration enables a prompt sensor misalignment correction from mechanical vibrations without extra targets. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in effectively extracting consistent features from LiDAR and camera data and fail to prioritize salient regions, compromising cross-modal alignment robustness. To address these issues, we propose DF-Calib, a LiDAR-camera calibration method that reformulates calibration as an intra-modality depth flow estimation problem. DF-Calib estimates a dense depth map from the camera image and completes the sparse LiDAR projected depth map, using a shared feature encoder to extract consistent depth-to-depth features, effectively bridging the 2D-3D cross-modal gap. Additionally, we introduce a reliability map to prioritize valid pixels and propose a perceptually weighted sparse flow loss to enhance depth flow estimation. Experimental results across multiple datasets validate its accuracy and generalization,with DF-Calib achieving a mean translation error of 0.635cm and rotation error of 0.045 degrees on the KITTI dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,3 figures, 3 figures</p></details> | None |

The aim of our research is to investigate how AVs can navigate crowded, unpredictable scenarios with multiple pedestrians while maintaining a safe and efficient vehicle behavior. So far, most research has concentrated on static or deterministic traffic participant behavior. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for motion planning in crowded spaces by combining social force principles for simulating realistic pedestrian behavior with a risk-aware motion planner. We evaluate this new algorithm in a 2D simulation environment to rigorously assess AV-pedestrian interactions, demonstrating that our algorithm enables safe, efficient, and adaptive motion planning, particularly in highly crowded urban environments - a first in achieving this level of performance. This study has not taken into consideration real-time constraints and has been shown only in simulation so far. Further studies are needed to investigate the novel algorithm in a complete software stack for AVs on real cars to investigate the entire perception, planning and control pipeline in crowded scenarios.

This research builds upon and extends existing approaches in risk-aware motion planning and occlusion tracking to address these challenges.

We, therefore, enhance a phantom agent-centric model by incorporating sequential reasoning to track occluded areas and predict potential hazards. Our model enables realistic scenario representation and context-aware risk evaluation by modeling diverse phantom agents, each with distinct behavior profiles. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach improves situational awareness and balances proactive safety with efficient traffic flow. While these results underline the potential of our method, validation in real-world scenarios is necessary to confirm its feasibility and generalizability.

However, existing timing analysis either produces a single conservative bound or suffers from severe scalability issues due to the exhaustive enumeration of every execution scenario. This causes significant difficulties in leveraging the probabilistic timing behaviours, resulting in sub-optimal design solutions. Modelling the system as a probabilistic directed acyclic graph (p-DAG), this paper presents a probabilistic response time analysis based on the longest paths of the p-DAG across all execution scenarios, enhancing the capability of the analysis by eliminating the need for enumeration. We first identify every longest path based on the structure of p-DAG and compute the probability of its occurrence. Then, the worst-case interfering workload is computed for each longest path, forming a complete probabilistic response time distribution with correctness guarantees. Experiments show that compared to the enumeration-based approach, the proposed analysis effectively scales to large p-DAGs with computation cost reduced by six orders of magnitude while maintaining a low deviation (1.04% on average and below 5% for most p-DAGs), empowering system design solutions with improved resource efficiency.</p></details> |  | None |

Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation. While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm, and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance with only a 0.4% IoU difference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multi-Modal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark.

Collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) seems like a promising direction, but collecting data for development is non-trivial. It requires placing multiple sensor-equipped agents in a real-world driving scene, simultaneously! As such, existing datasets are limited in locations and agents. We introduce a novel surrogate to the rescue, which is to generate realistic perception from different viewpoints in a driving scene, conditioned on a real-world sample - the ego-car's sensory data. This surrogate has huge potential: it could potentially turn any ego-car dataset into a collaborative driving one to scale up the development of CAV. We present the very first solution, using a combination of simulated collaborative data and real ego-car data. Our method, Transfer Your Perspective (TYP), learns a conditioned diffusion model whose output samples are not only realistic but also consistent in both semantics and layouts with the given ego-car data. Empirical results demonstrate TYP's effectiveness in aiding in a CAV setting. In particular, TYP enables us to (pre-)train collaborative perception algorithms like early and late fusion with little or no real-world collaborative data, greatly facilitating downstream CAV applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Existing prediction algorithms focus on extracting more detailed scene features or selecting more reasonable trajectory destinations. However, in the face of dynamic and evolving future movements of the target vehicle, these algorithms cannot provide a fine-grained and continuous description of future behaviors and lane constraints, which degrades the prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we present BLNet, a novel dualstream architecture that synergistically integrates behavioral intention recognition and lane constraint modeling through parallel attention mechanisms. The framework generates fine-grained behavior state queries (capturing spatial-temporal movement patterns) and lane queries (encoding lane topology constraints), supervised by two auxiliary losses, respectively. Subsequently, a two-stage decoder first produces trajectory proposals, then performs point-level refinement by jointly incorporating both the continuity of passed lanes and future motion features.

However, LiDAR point clouds may appear to have sparsity, uneven distribution, and incomplete structures, significantly limiting the detection performance. In road driving environments, target objects referring to vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists are well-suited for enhancing representation through the complete template guidance, considering their grid and topological structures. Therefore, this paper presents an intrinsic-feature-guided 3D object detection method based on a template-assisted feature enhancement module, which extracts intrinsic features from relatively generalized templates and provides rich structural information for foreground objects. Furthermore, a proposal-level contrastive learning mechanism is designed to enhance the feature differences between foreground and background objects. The proposed modules can act as plug-and-play components and improve the performance of multiple existing methods. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed method achieves the highly competitive detection results.

Prior works typically express spatial information through textual representations of coordinates, resulting in semantic gaps between visual coordinate representations and textual descriptions. This oversight hinders the accurate transmission of spatial information and increases the expressive burden. To address this, we propose a novel Marker-based Prompt learning framework (MPDrive), which represents spatial coordinates by concise visual markers, ensuring linguistic expressive consistency and enhancing the accuracy of both visual perception and spatial expression in AD-VQA. Specifically, we create marker images by employing a detection expert to overlay object regions with numerical labels, converting complex textual coordinate generation into straightforward text-based visual marker predictions. Moreover, we fuse original and marker images as scene-level features and integrate them with detection priors to derive instance-level features. By combining these features, we construct dual-granularity visual prompts that stimulate the LLM's spatial perception capabilities. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM and CODA-LM datasets show that MPDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in cases requiring sophisticated spatial understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

We present a novel semantic SLAM approach that leverages road elements such as lane boundaries, traffic signs, and road markings to enhance localization accuracy. Our system integrates real-time semantic feature detection with a graph optimization framework, effectively handling both rolling-shutter effects and INS drift. Using a practical hardware setup which consists of a rolling-shutter camera (3840*2160@30fps), IMU (100Hz), and wheel encoder (50Hz), we demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves higher recall (up to 5.35\%) and precision (up to 2.79\%) in semantic element detection, while maintaining mean relative error (MRE) within 10cm and mean absolute error (MAE) around 1m. Extensive experiments in diverse urban environments demonstrate the robust performance of our system under varying lighting conditions and complex traffic scenarios, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications.

However, these models require substantial computational resources for pretraining and are further constrained by available data during post-training. As such, scaling computation at test time emerges as both a critical and practical alternative to traditional model enlargement or re-training. In this work, we introduce SWIFT, a test-time scaling framework tailored for WFMs. SWIFT integrates our extensible WFM evaluation toolkit with process-level inference strategies, including fast tokenization, probability-based Top-K pruning, and efficient beam search. Empirical results on the COSMOS model demonstrate that test-time scaling exists even in a compute-optimal way. Our findings reveal that test-time scaling laws hold for WFMs and that SWIFT provides a scalable and effective pathway for improving WFM inference without retraining or increasing model size.

Existing methodologies typically adopt two paradigms: decision then planning or generation then scoring. However, the former architecture often suffers from decision-planning misalignment that incurs risky situations. Meanwhile, the latter struggles to balance short-term operational metrics (e.g., immediate motion smoothness) with long-term tactical goals (e.g., route efficiency), resulting in myopic or overly conservative behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce CALMM-Drive, a novel Confidence-Aware Large Multimodal Model (LMM) empowered Autonomous Driving framework. Our approach integrates driving task-oriented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with Top-K confidence elicitation, which facilitates high-level reasoning to generate multiple candidate decisions with their confidence levels. Furthermore, we propose a novel planning module that integrates a diffusion model for trajectory generation and a hierarchical refinement process to find the optimal trajectory. This framework enables the selection over trajectory candidates accounting for both low-level solution quality and high-level tactical confidence, which avoids the risks within one-shot decisions and overcomes the limitations in short-sighted scoring mechanisms. Comprehensive evaluations in nuPlan closed-loop simulation environments demonstrate the competitive performance of CALMM-Drive across both common and long-tail benchmarks, showcasing a significant advancement in the integration of uncertainty in LMM-empowered AVs. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures | None |

Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques have emerged as a key approach to visualizing model decisions, yet existing methods face inherent trade-offs. Gradient-based CAM variants suffer from sensitivity to gradient perturbations, leading to unstable and unreliable explanations. Conversely, gradient-free approaches mitigate gradient instability but incur significant computational overhead and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose Cluster Filter Class Activation Map (CF-CAM), a novel framework that reintroduces gradient-based weighting while enhancing robustness against gradient noise. CF-CAM employs a hierarchical importance weighting strategy to balance discriminative feature preservation and noise elimination. A density-aware channel clustering via Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) groups semantically relevant feature channels and discard noise-prone activations. Additionally, cluster-conditioned gradient filtering leverages bilateral filters to refine gradient signals, preserving edge-aware localization while suppressing noise impact. Experiment results demonstrate that CF-CAM achieves superior interpretability performance while maintaining resilience to gradient perturbations, outperforming state-of-the-art CAM methods in faithfulness and robustness. By effectively mitigating gradient instability without excessive computational cost, CF-CAM provides a reliable solution for enhancing the interpretability of deep neural networks in critical applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving.</p></details> |  | None |

Most existing methods employ a spatial propagation network to iteratively refine the depth map after obtaining an initial dense depth. In this paper, we propose DenseFormer, a novel method that integrates the diffusion model into the depth completion task. By incorporating the denoising mechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by progressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple iterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature pyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively extract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which serve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this paper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative refinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the diffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale information and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the predicted depth map.

Information from roadside cameras can greatly expand the map perception range through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. However, there is still no dataset from the real world available for the study on map vectorization onboard under the scenario of vehicle-infrastructure cooperation. To prosper the research on online HD mapping for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Autonomous Driving (VICAD), we release a real-world dataset, which contains collaborative camera frames from both vehicles and roadside infrastructures, and provides human annotations of HD map elements. We also present an end-to-end neural framework (i.e., V2I-HD) leveraging vision-centric V2I systems to construct vectorized maps. To reduce computation costs and further deploy V2I-HD on autonomous vehicles, we introduce a directionally decoupled self-attention mechanism to V2I-HD. Extensive experiments show that V2I-HD has superior performance in real-time inference speed, as tested by our real-world dataset.

Considering the extensive variation in lane structures worldwide, achieving high generalization capacity is particularly challenging, as algorithms must accurately identify a wide variety of lane patterns worldwide. Traditional top-down approaches rely heavily on learning lane characteristics from training datasets, often struggling with lanes exhibiting previously unseen attributes. To address this generalization limitation, we propose a method that detects keypoints of lanes and subsequently predicts sequential connections between them to construct complete 3D lanes. Each key point is essential for maintaining lane continuity, and we predict multiple proposals per keypoint by allowing adjacent grids to predict the same keypoint using an offset mechanism. PointNMS is employed to eliminate overlapping proposal keypoints, reducing redundancy in the estimated BEV graph and minimizing computational overhead from connection estimations. Our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on both the Apollo and OpenLane datasets, demonstrating superior F1 scores and a strong generalization capacity when models trained on OpenLane are evaluated on the Apollo dataset, compared to prior approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

Although sensor fusion architectures enhance performance in challenging environments, they still suffer significant performance drops under severe sensor failures, such as LiDAR beam reduction, LiDAR drop, limited field of view, camera drop, and occlusion. This limitation stems from inter-modality dependencies in current sensor fusion frameworks. In this study, we introduce an efficient and robust LiDAR-camera 3D object detector, referred to as MoME, which can achieve robust performance through a mixture of experts approach. Our MoME fully decouples modality dependencies using three parallel expert decoders, which use camera features, LiDAR features, or a combination of both to decode object queries, respectively. We propose Multi-Expert Decoding (MED) framework, where each query is decoded selectively using one of three expert decoders. MoME utilizes an Adaptive Query Router (AQR) to select the most appropriate expert decoder for each query based on the quality of camera and LiDAR features. This ensures that each query is processed by the best-suited expert, resulting in robust performance across diverse sensor failure scenarios. We evaluated the performance of MoME on the nuScenes-R benchmark.

From a safety perspective, sensor calibration is a key enabler of autonomous driving. In the current state of the art, a trend from target-based offline calibration towards targetless online calibration can be observed. However, online calibration is subject to strict real-time and resource constraints which are not met by state-of-the-art methods. This is mainly due to the high number of parameters to estimate, the reliance on geometric features, or the dependence on specific vehicle maneuvers. To meet these requirements and ensure the vehicle's safety at any time, we propose a miscalibration detection framework that shifts the focus from the direct regression of calibration parameters to a binary classification of the calibration state, i.e., calibrated or miscalibrated. Therefore, we propose a contrastive learning approach that compares embedded features in a latent space to classify the calibration state of two different sensor modalities. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the feature embeddings and challenging calibration errors that highlight the performance of our approach. As a result, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of detection performance, inference time, and resource demand.

To overcome the localization risks caused by dynamic landmarks in most VI-SLAM systems, a robust visual-inertial motion prior SLAM system, named (IDY-VINS), is proposed in this paper which effectively handles dynamic landmarks using inertial motion prior for dynamic environments to varying degrees. Specifically, potential dynamic landmarks are preprocessed during the feature tracking phase by the probabilistic model of landmarks' minimum projection errors which are obtained from inertial motion prior and epipolar constraint. Subsequently, a bundle adjustment (BA) residual is proposed considering the minimum projection error prior for dynamic candidate landmarks. This residual is integrated into a sliding window based nonlinear optimization process to estimate camera poses, IMU states and landmark positions while minimizing the impact of dynamic candidate landmarks that deviate from the motion prior. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy and time cost by robustly mitigating the influence of dynamic landmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets fall short in capturing the diversity and dynamics of VRU behaviors, making it difficult to meet the research demands of complex traffic environments. To address this gap, this study developed the OnSiteVRU datasets, which cover a variety of scenarios, including intersections, road segments, and urban villages. These datasets provide trajectory data for motor vehicles, electric bicycles, and human-powered bicycles, totaling approximately 17,429 trajectories with a precision of 0.04 seconds. The datasets integrate both aerial-view natural driving data and onboard real-time dynamic detection data, along with environmental information such as traffic signals, obstacles, and real-time maps, enabling a comprehensive reconstruction of interaction events. The results demonstrate that VRU\_Data outperforms traditional datasets in terms of VRU density and scene coverage, offering a more comprehensive representation of VRU behavioral characteristics. This provides critical support for traffic flow modeling, trajectory prediction, and autonomous driving virtual testing.

A commonly used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming. To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by T-PAMI2025</p></details> | None |

This limitation poses a significant safety risk, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), autonomous vehicle systems have been involved in hundreds of reported crashes annually in the United States, occurred in corner cases like sun glare and fog, which caused a few fatal accident. Furthermore, in order to consistently maintain a robust and reliable autonomous driving system, it is essential for models not only to perform well on routine scenarios but also to adapt to newly emerging scenarios, especially those corner cases that deviate from the norm. This requires a learning mechanism that incrementally integrates new knowledge without degrading previously acquired capabilities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing continual learning methods have been proposed to ensure consistent and scalable corner case learning in autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-C4L, a continual learning framework that introduces Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to dynamically optimize and enhance corner case datasets, and VLM-C4L combines VLM-guided high-quality data extraction with a core data replay strategy, enabling the model to incrementally learn from diverse corner cases while preserving performance on previously routine scenarios, thus ensuring long-term stability and adaptability in real-world autonomous driving. We evaluate VLM-C4L on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo and the corner case dataset CODA.</p></details> |  | None |

However, due to the complexities of an MG problem, seeking (Markov perfect) Nash equilibrium (NE) is often very challenging for a general-sum MG. Markov potential games (MPGs), which are a special class of MGs, have appealing properties such as guaranteed existence of pure NEs and guaranteed convergence of gradient play algorithms, thereby leading to desirable properties for many MARL algorithms in their NE-seeking processes. However, the question of how to construct MPGs has been open. This paper provides sufficient conditions on the reward design and on the Markov decision process (MDP), under which an MG is an MPG. Numerical results on autonomous driving applications are reported.</p></details> |  | None |

Specifically, despite impressive results shown by the mass literature, developers often find it hard to ensure the safe deployment of these learning-based perception models. Attributing the challenge to the lack of safety-oriented metrics, we hereby present uncompromising spatial constraints (USC), which characterize a simple yet important localization requirement demanding the predictions to fully cover the objects when seen from the autonomous vehicle. The constraints, as we formulate using the perspective and bird's-eye views, can be naturally reflected by quantitative measures, such that having an object detector with a higher score implies a lower risk of collision. Finally, beyond model evaluation, we incorporate the quantitative measures into common loss functions to enable safety-oriented fine-tuning for existing models. With experiments using the nuScenes dataset and a closed-loop simulation, our work demonstrates such considerations of safety notions at the perception level not only improve model performances beyond accuracy but also allow for a more direct linkage to actual system safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2024, 8 pages (IEEE double column format), 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> | None |

While existing methods have made significant progress, they often overlook explicit safety constraints and struggle to capture the complex interactions among traffic agents, environmental factors, and motion dynamics. To address these challenges, we present SafeCast, a risk-responsive motion forecasting model that integrates safety-aware decision-making with uncertainty-aware adaptability. SafeCast is the first to incorporate the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) framework into motion forecasting, encoding interpretable safety rules--such as safe distances and collision avoidance--based on traffic norms and physical principles. To further enhance robustness, we introduce the Graph Uncertainty Feature (GUF), a graph-based module that injects learnable noise into Graph Attention Networks, capturing real-world uncertainties and enhancing generalization across diverse scenarios. We evaluate SafeCast on four real-world benchmark datasets--Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), ApolloScape, and the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD)--covering highway, urban, and mixed-autonomy traffic environments. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy while maintaining a lightweight architecture and low inference latency, underscoring its potential for real-time deployment in safety-critical AD systems.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy execution and policy iteration. On the one hand, the common action space structure with single action type limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. On the other hand, the multi-attribute weighted single reward function result in the agent's disproportionate attention to certain objectives during policy iterations. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, a parameterized action space is constructed to generate hybrid driving actions, combining both abstract guidance and concrete control commands. A multi-objective critics architecture is constructed considering multiple attribute rewards, to ensure simultaneously focusing on different driving objectives. Additionally, uncertainty-based exploration strategy is introduced to help the agent faster approach viable driving policy. The experimental results in both the simulated traffic environment and the HighD dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve multi-objective compatible autonomous driving in terms of driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety. It enhances the general performance of the driving while significantly increasing training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> | None |

While this is a well-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such as fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we explore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks consisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in closed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a low-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through experiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and highlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop evaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to 23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 9.93% in comparison to standard fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation, ICRA 2025</p></details> | None |
| **[Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18024v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  | None |

However, existing datasets and methods suffer from coarse-grained language instructions, and inadequate integration of 3D geometric reasoning with linguistic comprehension. To this end, we introduce NuGrounding, the first large-scale benchmark for multi-view 3D visual grounding in autonomous driving. We present a Hierarchy of Grounding (HoG) method to construct NuGrounding to generate hierarchical multi-level instructions, ensuring comprehensive coverage of human instruction patterns. To tackle this challenging dataset, we propose a novel paradigm that seamlessly combines instruction comprehension abilities of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) with precise localization abilities of specialist detection models. Our approach introduces two decoupled task tokens and a context query to aggregate 3D geometric information and semantic instructions, followed by a fusion decoder to refine spatial-semantic feature fusion for precise localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines adapted from representative 3D scene understanding methods by a significant margin and achieves 0.59 in precision and 0.64 in recall, with improvements of 50.8% and 54.7%.</p></details> |  | None |

However, in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, points rarely move independently of others, especially for nearby points belonging to the same object, which often share the same motion. Incorporating this locally rigid motion constraint has been a key challenge in self-supervised scene flow estimation, which is often addressed by post-processing or appending extra regularization. While these approaches are able to improve the rigidity of predicted flows, they lack an architectural inductive bias for local rigidity within the model structure, leading to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior performance. In contrast, we enforce local rigidity with a lightweight add-on module in neural network design, enabling end-to-end learning. We design a discretized voting space that accommodates all possible translations and then identify the one shared by nearby points by differentiable voting. Additionally, to ensure computational efficiency, we operate on pillars rather than points and learn representative features for voting per pillar. We plug the Voting Module into popular model designs and evaluate its benefit on Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets. We outperform baseline works with only marginal compute overhead.

This is especially important for scene understanding tasks with safety critical applications, such as in autonomous driving. Existing datasets allow evaluation of only knowns or unknowns - but not both, which is required to establish "in the wild" suitability of deep neural network models. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel anomaly segmentation dataset, ISSU, that features a diverse set of anomaly inputs from cluttered real-world environments. The dataset is twice larger than existing anomaly segmentation datasets, and provides a training, validation and test set for controlled in-domain evaluation. The test set consists of a static and temporal part, with the latter comprised of videos. The dataset provides annotations for both closed-set (knowns) and anomalies, enabling closed-set and open-set evaluation. The dataset covers diverse conditions, such as domain and cross-sensor shift, illumination variation and allows ablation of anomaly detection methods with respect to these variations. Evaluation results of current state-of-the-art methods confirm the need for improvements especially in domain-generalization, small and large object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> | None |

In such applications, camera-based perception enables the extraction of additional modalities (human pose, text) to enhance prediction accuracy. Indeed, we find that textual descriptions play a crucial role in integrating additional modalities into a unified understanding. However, online extraction of text requires the use of VLM, which may not be feasible for resource-constrained systems. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework: a student model with limited modality is distilled from a teacher model trained with full range of modalities. The comprehensive knowledge of a teacher model trained with trajectory, human pose, and text is distilled into a student model using only trajectory or human pose as a sole supplement. In doing so, we separately distill the core locomotion insights from intra-agent multi-modality and inter-agent interaction. Our generalizable framework is validated with two state-of-the-art models across three datasets on both ego-view (JRDB, SIT) and BEV-view (ETH/UCY) setups, utilizing both annotated and VLM-generated text captions. Distilled student models show consistent improvement in all prediction metrics for both full and instantaneous observations, improving up to ~13%.

Recent studies focus on integrating spatiotemporal information obtained from past observations to improve prediction accuracy, using a multi-frame fusion approach that processes multiple past frames together. However, these methods struggle with a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, which significantly limits their practicality. To mitigate this trade-off, we propose StreamOcc, a novel framework that aggregates spatio-temporal information in a stream-based manner. StreamOcc consists of two key components: (i) Stream-based Voxel Aggregation, which effectively accumulates past observations while minimizing computational costs, and (ii) Query-guided Aggregation, which recurrently aggregates instance-level features of dynamic objects into corresponding voxel features, refining fine-grained details of dynamic objects. Experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset show that StreamOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time settings, while reducing memory usage by more than 50% compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  | None |

In recent years, Transformer-based segmentation methods have demonstrated strong performance in global feature modeling. However, they still struggle with blurred target boundaries and insufficient recognition of small targets. To address these issues, this study proposes a Mask2Former-based semantic segmentation algorithm incorporating a boundary enhancement feature bridging module (BEFBM). The goal is to improve target boundary accuracy and segmentation consistency. Built upon the Mask2Former framework, this method constructs a boundary-aware feature map and introduces a feature bridging mechanism. This enables effective cross-scale feature fusion, enhancing the model's ability to focus on target boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset demonstrate that, compared to mainstream segmentation methods, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in metrics such as mIOU, mDICE, and mRecall. It also exhibits superior boundary retention in complex scenes. Visual analysis further confirms the model's advantages in fine-grained regions. Future research will focus on optimizing computational efficiency and exploring its potential in other high-precision segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  | None |

Recently, state-of-the-art map vectorization methods are mainly based on DETR-like framework to generate HD maps in an end-to-end manner. In this paper, we propose InteractionMap, which improves previous map vectorization methods by fully leveraging local-to-global information interaction in both time and space. Firstly, we explore enhancing DETR-like detectors by explicit position relation prior from point-level to instance-level, since map elements contain strong shape priors. Secondly, we propose a key-frame-based hierarchical temporal fusion module, which interacts temporal information from local to global. Lastly, the separate classification branch and regression branch lead to the problem of misalignment in the output distribution. We interact semantic information with geometric information by introducing a novel geometric-aware classification loss in optimization and a geometric-aware matching cost in label assignment. InteractionMap achieves state-of-the-art performance on both nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks.</p></details> |  | None |

To this end, we introduce $\textbf{VLADBench}$, a challenging and fine-grained dataset featuring close-form QAs that progress from static foundational knowledge and elements to advanced reasoning for dynamic on-road situations. The elaborate $\textbf{VLADBench}$ spans 5 key domains: Traffic Knowledge Understanding, General Element Recognition, Traffic Graph Generation, Target Attribute Comprehension, and Ego Decision-Making and Planning. These domains are further broken down into 11 secondary aspects and 29 tertiary tasks for a granular evaluation. A thorough assessment of general and domain-specific (DS) VLMs on this benchmark reveals both their strengths and critical limitations in AD contexts. To further exploit the cognitive and reasoning interactions among the 5 domains for AD understanding, we start from a small-scale VLM and train the DS models on individual domain datasets (collected from 1.4M DS QAs across public sources). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark provides a crucial step toward a more comprehensive assessment of VLMs in AD, paving the way for the development of more cognitively sophisticated and reasoning-capable AD systems.</p></details> |  | None |

In autonomous driving, 3D semantic segmentation plays an important role for enabling safe navigation. Despite significant advances in the field, the complexity of collecting and annotating 3D data is a bottleneck in this developments. To overcome that data annotation limitation, synthetic simulated data has been used to generate annotated data on demand. There is still however a domain gap between real and simulated data. More recently, diffusion models have been in the spotlight, enabling close-to-real data synthesis. Those generative models have been recently applied to the 3D data domain for generating scene-scale data with semantic annotations. Still, those methods either rely on image projection or decoupled models trained with different resolutions in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such intermediary representations impact the generated data quality due to errors added in those transformations. In this work, we propose a novel approach able to generate 3D semantic scene-scale data without relying on any projection or decoupled trained multi-resolution models, achieving more realistic semantic scene data generation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Besides improving 3D semantic scene-scale data synthesis, we thoroughly evaluate the use of the synthetic scene samples as labeled data to train a semantic segmentation network. In our experiments, we show that using the synthetic annotated data generated by our method as training data together with the real semantic segmentation labels, leads to an improvement in the semantic segmentation model performance. Our results show the potential of generated scene-scale point clouds to generate more training data to extend existing datasets, reducing the data annotation effort.

The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

However, classical reinforcement learning methods optimize policies by maximizing expected rewards but lack sufficient safety considerations, often putting agents in hazardous situations. This paper proposes a risk-aware reinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving to improve the safety performance when crossing the intersection. Safe critics are constructed to evaluate driving risk and work in conjunction with the reward critic to update the actor. Based on this, a Lagrangian relaxation method and cyclic gradient iteration are combined to project actions into a feasible safe region. Furthermore, a Multi-hop and Multi-layer perception (MLP) mixed Attention Mechanism (MMAM) is incorporated into the actor-critic network, enabling the policy to adapt to dynamic traffic and overcome permutation sensitivity challenges. This allows the policy to focus more effectively on surrounding potential risks while enhancing the identification of passing opportunities. Simulation tests are conducted on different tasks at unsignalized intersections. The results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces collision rates and improves crossing efficiency in comparison to baseline algorithms. Additionally, our ablation experiments demonstrate the benefits of incorporating risk-awareness and MMAM into RL.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures | None |

To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the methodologies and applications of LLMs in traffic and transportation, highlighting their ability to process unstructured textual data to advance transportation research. We explore key applications, including autonomous driving, travel behavior prediction, and general transportation-related queries, alongside methodologies such as zero- or few-shot learning, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning. Our analysis identifies critical research gaps. From the methodological perspective, many research gaps can be addressed by integrating LLMs with existing tools and refining LLM architectures. From the application perspective, we identify numerous opportunities for LLMs to tackle a variety of traffic and transportation challenges, building upon existing research. By synthesizing these findings, this review not only clarifies the current state of LLM adoption and adaptation in traffic and transportation but also proposes future research directions, paving the way for smarter and more sustainable transportation systems.</p></details> |  | None |

While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  | None |

Integrated circuits (ICs) are the backbone of modern computing devices across industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), consumer electronics, healthcare, automotive, industrial, and aerospace. Moore Law has driven the semiconductor IC industry toward smaller dimensions, improved performance, and greater energy efficiency. However, as transistors shrink to atomic scales, aging-related degradation mechanisms such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), Electromigration (EM), and stochastic aging-induced variations have become major reliability threats.

| **[Adversarial Wear and Tear: Exploiting Natural Damage for Generating Physical-World Adversarial Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21164v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of adversarial examples in the physical world poses significant challenges to the deployment of Deep Neural Networks in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Most existing methods for crafting physical-world adversarial examples are ad-hoc, relying on temporary modifications like shadows, laser beams, or stickers that are tailored to specific scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new class of physical-world adversarial examples, AdvWT, which draws inspiration from the naturally occurring phenomenon of `wear and tear', an inherent property of physical objects. Unlike manually crafted perturbations, `wear and tear' emerges organically over time due to environmental degradation, as seen in the gradual deterioration of outdoor signboards. To achieve this, AdvWT follows a two-step approach. First, a GAN-based, unsupervised image-to-image translation network is employed to model these naturally occurring damages, particularly in the context of outdoor signboards. The translation network encodes the characteristics of damaged signs into a latent `damage style code'. In the second step, we introduce adversarial perturbations into the style code, strategically optimizing its transformation process. This manipulation subtly alters the damage style representation, guiding the network to generate adversarial images where the appearance of damages remains perceptually realistic, while simultaneously ensuring their effectiveness in misleading neural networks. Through comprehensive experiments on two traffic sign datasets, we show that AdvWT effectively misleads DNNs in both digital and physical domains. AdvWT achieves an effective attack success rate, greater robustness, and a more natural appearance compared to existing physical-world adversarial examples. Additionally, integrating AdvWT into training enhances a model's generalizability to real-world damaged signs.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures | None |

This scenario naturally arises in various applications, such as autonomous driving and human-robot collaboration, where the behavior of uncontrollable agents, like pedestrians, cannot be directly controlled but is influenced by the actions of the autonomous vehicle or robot. In this paper, we present SPARC (Safe Prediction-Based Robust Controller for Coupled Agents), a novel framework designed to ensure safe control in the presence of coupled uncontrollable agents. SPARC leverages conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in data-driven prediction of agent behavior. Particularly, we introduce a joint distribution-based approach to account for the coupled dynamics of the controlled system and uncontrollable agents. By integrating the control barrier function (CBF) technique, SPARC provides provable safety guarantees at a high confidence level. We illustrate our framework with a case study involving an autonomous driving scenario with walking pedestrians.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[SplatFlow: Self-Supervised Dynamic Gaussian Splatting in Neural Motion Flow Field for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15482v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing Dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods for complex dynamic urban scenarios rely on accurate object-level supervision from expensive manual labeling, limiting their scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a Self-Supervised Dynamic Gaussian Splatting within Neural Motion Flow Fields (NMFF) to learn 4D space-time representations without requiring tracked 3D bounding boxes, enabling accurate dynamic scene reconstruction and novel view RGB/depth/flow synthesis. SplatFlow designs a unified framework to seamlessly integrate time-dependent 4D Gaussian representation within NMFF, where NMFF is a set of implicit functions to model temporal motions of both LiDAR points and Gaussians as continuous motion flow fields. Leveraging NMFF, SplatFlow effectively decomposes static background and dynamic objects, representing them with 3D and 4D Gaussian primitives, respectively. NMFF also models the correspondences of each 4D Gaussian across time, which aggregates temporal features to enhance cross-view consistency of dynamic components. SplatFlow further improves dynamic object identification by distilling features from 2D foundation models into 4D space-time representation. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo and KITTI Datasets validate SplatFlow's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for both image reconstruction and novel view synthesis in dynamic urban scenarios.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Survey on Monocular Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11841v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is fundamental to computer vision, enabling spatial understanding, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous driving. Deep learning-based MDE predicts relative depth from a single image, but the lack of metric scale introduces inconsistencies, limiting applicability in tasks such as visual SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) overcomes this limitation by enabling precise scene-scale inference, improving depth consistency, enhancing stability in sequential tasks, and streamlining integration into practical systems. This paper systematically reviews the evolution of depth estimation, from traditional geometric methods to deep learning breakthroughs, emphasizing scale-agnostic approaches in zero-shot generalization which is crucial for advancing MMDE. Recent progress in zero-shot MMDE is examined, focusing on challenges such as model generalization and boundary detail loss. To address these issues, researchers have explored unlabeled data augmentation, image patching, architectural optimization, and generative techniques. This review analyzes these developments, assessing their impact and limitations. Key findings are synthesized, unresolved challenges outlined, and future research direction proposal. By providing a clear technical roadmap and insight into emerging trends, this work aims to drive innovation and expand the real-world applications of MMDE.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Automated Vehicle Driver Monitoring Dataset from Real-World Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09833v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From SAE Level 3 of automation onwards, drivers are allowed to engage in activities that are not directly related to driving during their travel. However, in level 3, a misunderstanding of the capabilities of the system might lead drivers to engage in secondary tasks, which could impair their ability to react to challenging traffic situations. Anticipating driver activity allows for early detection of risky behaviors, to prevent accidents. To be able to predict the driver activity, a Deep Learning network needs to be trained on a dataset. However, the use of datasets based on simulation for training and the migration to real-world data for prediction has proven to be suboptimal. Hence, this paper presents a real-world driver activity dataset, openly accessible on IEEE Dataport, which encompasses various activities that occur in autonomous driving scenarios under various illumination and weather conditions. Results from the training process showed that the dataset provides an excellent benchmark for implementing models for driver activity recognition.</p></details> | 6 pages | None |

BEV representation enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation, a concise view of the environment useful for planning a vehicle's trajectory. However, this representation is not fully supported by existing datasets, and creation of new datasets for this purpose can be a time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, we introduce SimBEV. SimBEV is a randomized synthetic data generation tool that is extensively configurable and scalable, supports a wide array of sensors, incorporates information from multiple sources to capture accurate BEV ground truth, and enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation and 3D object detection. SimBEV is used to create the SimBEV dataset, a large collection of annotated perception data from diverse driving scenarios.

While LiDAR and visual (RGB) sensors are commonly used, thermal imaging remains underrepresented in datasets, despite its acknowledged advantages for VRU detection in extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we present R-LiViT, the first dataset to combine LiDAR, RGB, and thermal imaging from a roadside perspective, with a strong focus on VRUs. R-LiViT captures three intersections during both day and night, ensuring a diverse dataset. It includes 10,000 LiDAR frames and 2,400 temporally and spatially aligned RGB and thermal images across over 150 traffic scenarios, with 6 and 8 annotated classes respectively, providing a comprehensive resource for tasks such as object detection and tracking.

| **[AccidentSim: Generating Physically Realistic Vehicle Collision Videos from Real-World Accident Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20654v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting real-world vehicle accident videos for autonomous driving research is challenging due to their rarity and complexity. While existing driving video generation methods may produce visually realistic videos, they often fail to deliver physically realistic simulations because they lack the capability to generate accurate post-collision trajectories. In this paper, we introduce AccidentSim, a novel framework that generates physically realistic vehicle collision videos by extracting and utilizing the physical clues and contextual information available in real-world vehicle accident reports. Specifically, AccidentSim leverages a reliable physical simulator to replicate post-collision vehicle trajectories from the physical and contextual information in the accident reports and to build a vehicle collision trajectory dataset. This dataset is then used to fine-tune a language model, enabling it to respond to user prompts and predict physically consistent post-collision trajectories across various driving scenarios based on user descriptions. Finally, we employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to render high-quality backgrounds, merging them with the foreground vehicles that exhibit physically realistic trajectories to generate vehicle collision videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the videos produced by AccidentSim excel in both visual and physical authenticity.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Generating Multimodal Driving Scenes via Next-Scene Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14945v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models in Autonomous Driving (AD) enable diverse scene creation, yet existing methods fall short by only capturing a limited range of modalities, restricting the capability of generating controllable scenes for comprehensive evaluation of AD systems. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal generation framework that incorporates four major data modalities, including a novel addition of map modality. With tokenized modalities, our scene sequence generation framework autoregressively predicts each scene while managing computational demands through a two-stage approach. The Temporal AutoRegressive (TAR) component captures inter-frame dynamics for each modality while the Ordered AutoRegressive (OAR) component aligns modalities within each scene by sequentially predicting tokens in a fixed order. To maintain coherence between map and ego-action modalities, we introduce the Action-aware Map Alignment (AMA) module, which applies a transformation based on the ego-action to maintain coherence between these modalities. Our framework effectively generates complex, realistic driving scenes over extended sequences, ensuring multimodal consistency and offering fine-grained control over scene elements.

We introduce GAIA-2, Generative AI for Autonomy, a latent diffusion world model that unifies these capabilities within a single generative framework. GAIA-2 supports controllable video generation conditioned on a rich set of structured inputs: ego-vehicle dynamics, agent configurations, environmental factors, and road semantics. It generates high-resolution, spatiotemporally consistent multi-camera videos across geographically diverse driving environments (UK, US, Germany). The model integrates both structured conditioning and external latent embeddings (e.g., from a proprietary driving model) to facilitate flexible and semantically grounded scene synthesis. Through this integration, GAIA-2 enables scalable simulation of both common and rare driving scenarios, advancing the use of generative world models as a core tool in the development of autonomous systems.

| **[Unleashing HyDRa: Hybrid Fusion, Depth Consistency and Radar for Unified 3D Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07746v4)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-cost, vision-centric 3D perception systems for autonomous driving have made significant progress in recent years, narrowing the gap to expensive LiDAR-based methods. The primary challenge in becoming a fully reliable alternative lies in robust depth prediction capabilities, as camera-based systems struggle with long detection ranges and adverse lighting and weather conditions. In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion architecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of dense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid fusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar features in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association Transformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to produce more robust and accurate depth predictions. In the BEV, we refine the initial sparse representation by a Radar-weighted Depth Consistency. HyDRa achieves a new state-of-the-art for camera-radar fusion of 64.2 NDS (+1.8) and 58.4 AMOTA (+1.5) on the public nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our new semantically rich and spatially accurate BEV features can be directly converted into a powerful occupancy representation, beating all previous camera-based methods on the Occ3D benchmark by an impressive 3.7 mIoU.

This paper introduces TopoBDA (Topology with Bezier Deformable Attention), a novel approach that enhances road topology comprehension by leveraging Bezier Deformable Attention (BDA). TopoBDA processes multi-camera 360-degree imagery to generate Bird's Eye View (BEV) features, which are refined through a transformer decoder employing BDA. BDA utilizes Bezier control points to drive the deformable attention mechanism, improving the detection and representation of elongated and thin polyline structures, such as lane centerlines. Additionally, TopoBDA integrates two auxiliary components: an instance mask formulation loss and a one-to-many set prediction loss strategy, to further refine centerline detection and enhance road topology understanding. Experimental evaluations on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that TopoBDA outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in centerline detection and topology reasoning. TopoBDA also achieves the best results on the OpenLane-V1 dataset in 3D lane detection. Further experiments on integrating multi-modal data -- such as LiDAR, radar, and SDMap -- show that multimodal inputs can further enhance performance in road topology understanding.</p></details> |  | None |
| **[Hi-ALPS -- An Experimental Robustness Quantification of Six LiDAR-based Object Detection Systems for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17168v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is an essential sensor technology for autonomous driving as it can capture high-resolution 3D data. As 3D object detection systems (OD) can interpret such point cloud data, they play a key role in the driving decisions of autonomous vehicles. Consequently, such 3D OD must be robust against all types of perturbations and must therefore be extensively tested. One approach is the use of adversarial examples, which are small, sometimes sophisticated perturbations in the input data that change, i.e., falsify, the prediction of the OD. These perturbations are carefully designed based on the weaknesses of the OD. The robustness of the OD cannot be quantified with adversarial examples in general, because if the OD is vulnerable to a given attack, it is unclear whether this is due to the robustness of the OD or whether the attack algorithm produces particularly strong adversarial examples. The contribution of this work is Hi-ALPS -- Hierarchical Adversarial-example-based LiDAR Perturbation Level System, where higher robustness of the OD is required to withstand the perturbations as the perturbation levels increase. In doing so, the Hi-ALPS levels successively implement a heuristic followed by established adversarial example approaches. In a series of comprehensive experiments using Hi-ALPS, we quantify the robustness of six state-of-the-art 3D OD under different types of perturbations. The results of the experiments show that none of the OD is robust against all Hi-ALPS levels; an important factor for the ranking is that human observers can still correctly recognize the perturbed objects, as the respective perturbations are small. To increase the robustness of the OD, we discuss the applicability of state-of-the-art countermeasures. In addition, we derive further suggestions for countermeasures based on our experimental results.</p></details> |  | None |

However, most existing methods lack generalization and are limited to specific tasks such as image recovery. To address these issues, we propose Gated-Mechanism Mixture-of-Experts (GM-MoE), the first framework to introduce a mixture-of-experts network for low-light image enhancement. GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MoE achieves superior generalization with respect to 25 compared approaches, reaching state-of-the-art performance on PSNR on 5 benchmarks and SSIM on 4 benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  | None |
